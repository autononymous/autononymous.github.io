<p>&emsp;The skyline burns in the light of an everlasting sun. Blistering winds raise the virgin snow into clouds of shimmering flakes, blending the distant foilage of the tundra into the ancient sheets of frost. Dry snowbanks of frigid, grating ice stretch further than my eyes can focus, cracking like dead leaves in the wake of my footfalls. </p>
<p>&emsp;I am a Snowdrifter, and this is my last adventure: tethering the line of danger and death in pursuit of artifacts from a long-past age. Only the poor dare to venture beyond the walls of the the last city, seeking treasures and wares to sell to others who have the money to collect them. But for this last trip, I&apos;m not alone. </p>
<p>&emsp;We unwrap the scarves from our faces when the smoke no longer saturates our lungs, trading breath behind fabric for the freshness of the biting cold. Furs cover every surface of our flesh with at least an inch of insulation, trapping snowflakes between strands of fur like flies to honeyed paper. </p>
<p>&emsp;Somewhere hours behind us, the last city of Blackwater awakens. Streetlamps of lighttime set civilians on their schedule in the absence of a setting sun. Turbines churn power into the veins of the Humans&apos; last city, pumping life and heat into a dying, frostbitten husk: a heat we don&apos;t have his far beyond the walls.</p>
<p>&emsp;But there&apos;s a different way to keep warm, even if it stings.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin takes swigs from the bottle to warm his insides, casting me in the shadow of his stature. His dark skin sweats from internal heat as he carries the weight of all his corded muscle. The warmth of liquor gives us enough breath to speak, despite how the frigid air burns our lungs. And he does enough speaking for the two of us, passing time in chaff by listing as many as he can remember.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot; . . . And then the one girl I snuck off with after the end of Seminary. Then that one broad from down the hall, you know, when we moved into the Lofts: the one that said she worked with livestock. I&apos;m not sure what she did with the animals, but she changed my whole view of what a woman can do.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;My lungs burn on a laugh as he takes a deep swig, using the bottle to punctuate his sentences. </p>
<p>&emsp;He says, &quot;I think that woman ruined my sense of taste!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, really?&quot; I ask. &quot;Becuase you think you can do any better?&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;Half the time I think he&apos;s off on a bit, but this time, it&apos;s too hard to tell. Romin spent the last hour recounting the names of all his sexual partners. The hour before, he recounted his plans for life after service in the Royal Guard, and how he plans to spend all his money. And now that the booze blocks his memory, he uses the next hour to badger me again with the same stupid question.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I invited myself to come because I was afraid you weren&apos;t planning on coming back. Gods above, the years you spent getting to this point . . . and when they want to throw a lavish party in your honor, you turn them down for this?&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;He gestures at the barren landscape. Trapped in an open room of white flakes, there&apos;s nothing to see except the silhouettes of trees, the sky above us, and maybe rogue bands of Chymaerans, concealing their slender limbs in the branches. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods above, Titus! You&apos;re the Valedictorian of all the Academies,&quot; Romin says. &quot;You should be using it to get everything you can. It&apos;s the anxiety of what comes next that makes all the sex so much better.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t do it for recognition,&quot; I tell him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then for what? You&apos;re not weak like the lower ranks. You&apos;ve made it,&quot; he insists. &quot;We made it. Our whole Fireteam did. Did you know that eight percent of graduates this year iced themselves?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. And I saw the empty seats from the stage at graduation.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course, our Fireteam is good enough to defend the city: top one percent. But if you were with those losers, wouldn&apos;t it be better to die beyond the walls? Taking the fight to the Chymaera, rather than falling on your own blade?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re not losers. It&apos;s not their fault: most are coerced into it, even bred for it. Some send their sons and daughters to the Academy with apathy for what comes after. They crank out kids like rabbits for the welfare &mdash; train them high enough to get into an upper class, and you&apos;re relieved of poverty for as long as they can study.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you were adopted,&quot; Romin says. &quot;And your father wastes his own money, not yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, he wastes my money, too,&quot; I say. &quot;He gets most of the check.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;But you don&apos;t have the ties of blood like us, so why did you even bother? What made you fight?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A feeling,&quot; I tell him. </p>
<p>&emsp;A feeling I&apos;ve had since as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A feeling?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What kind of feeling?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I tell him, because I don&apos;t have the words. Somewhere between desperate longing and crippling anxiety. It&apos;s been so long that I can only remember the experiences that shaped it. </p>
<p>&emsp;So many years ago in that orphanage with Sylvia, it came from a dream I had. When  I was watching all the other kids get adopted. When I had a bedroom window facing the impassable gates. All I ever wanted was to be good enough for a mom and dad &mdash; knowing if I turned eighteen, they&apos;d pitch me on the side of the road and I&apos;d end up like the homeless outwallers. Maybe it&apos;s been raising my sister after my father gave up. Or maybe it was just a spark based off some childish thought &mdash; like revenge against fate, or some innocent dream of grandeur.</p>
<p>&emsp;He offers his bottle to usher me further, and after a sip, I try again.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All I&apos;ve ever thought of in this life is what I still have to do, and the people I have to do it for.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. Because winning just happens &mdash; not from all those nights you turned down our adventures for studying. I know they blend together, but . . . can&apos;t you remember any of it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course!&quot; There&apos;s too many to count. &quot;The time we explored the pitch-dark drainage tunnels in first year? When you led us from the front, screaming that you saw something? And we ran? How Valentina tore and dirtied up her dress so bad we had to cover her with your coat, or else she&apos;d be parading the halls in her underwear?&quot; I expose the flesh on my left arm. A small staccato of scars spans the space above the birthmark on my wrist. &quot;I sure remember how infected this got.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He laughs. &quot;Oh, and the . . . and the time after that when Sylvia drank for the first time?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I remember how close she got to me when we were in the hallway alone. My heart was pounding. She hunched over so far we were at eye level. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I still have that picture she drew &mdash; I framed it on the wall because she hides it every time I leave it out. You think I could sell it to some rich Merlotan family twenty years from now?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The thought makes him laugh. The cold makes him cough and stumble. &quot;Gods above. The darling artist whose Academy posters are all over Blackwater. How would those filthy-rich Merlotan pigs try to brag about it on the wall over cheese and crackers?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I imagine Valentina&apos;s family &mdash; expensive drink in one hand, the other gesturing to the marble plaque below the framed napkin on the wall. Oh, I can see it . . . that pretentious cursive serif they use, etched black. With two words.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I let the image stew for a while. Romin takes a swig of the moonshine his Carmine brotherhood makes, and I only speak when the bottle is upsidedown in my mouth.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin spits. It almost shoots out his nose before he can regain himself. He drops the lead of his sled and almost disappears into the virgin snow before he finds his breath again, laughing hysterically. &quot;That&apos;s not what I saw at all. But you&apos;re right! Gods above &mdash; I must have had it upside-down.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Isn&apos;t that how all art works?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I guess. Unless it has letters on it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He chuckles a couple times before finding his composure. I ruffle my jet-black beard. &quot;See, I didn&apos;t forget the stuff that matters.  I just remember . . . how you guys made me feel, you know, despite how distant I was. Like I was always welcome to return when I was ready.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, it&apos;s over now. You never &apos;got&apos; ready. And now we&apos;re out past the walls, telling jokes on the edge of death. You gave up a fully-funded Academy celebration to trudge around outside the walls and act poor. We&apos;ve made it, Titus! Maybe we&apos;ll never be as rich as Valentina, but you don&apos;t need to do this anymore. To trudge through snow for several days? Dragging back ancient knick-knacks and forbidden books? So that rich Merlotans can buy them from your father&apos;s eternal rummage sale, and plant them on their mantle as a talking piece?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not about that,&quot; I insist. &quot;Not this time. I&apos;m not going to be down in the lower city anymore, so Ellie and Clint will have to manage on their own. It&apos;s about something else. This map&mdash;&quot; but he ignores me, with that lofty look that sticks in his eyes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I thought I had power this close to the top, but you&apos;re on a whole other level. You could have done anything! Hold a party on the Academy&apos;s money, plaster your name and face on everything, and you could take any broad home you want. And if you played it right, maybe two or three, if they were some of those cadets below second rank looking to pop their cherry, before they&apos;re sent off to get iced by the Chymaera.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d take adventure over all that social posturing any day,&quot; I say. &quot;You think it would ever end up about me? I&apos;m not about that. And talking to leadership is like watching old people eat. No &mdash; it is watching old people eat. That&apos;s the only reason any instructors or cadets would show up: to load their plates first, and act like they&apos;re there for me second.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, I get it,&quot; Romin says. &quot;If you want someone to blow your horn all night, you&apos;d rather have your lady do it in private.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, screw off,&quot; I tell him. Usually he cracks a smile trying to get a rise out of me, but is as if there&apos;s some truth he found snared in it.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All that time you spend in the Academy lofts, doing whatever it is you do, we hardly see you. Gods above, you should&apos;ve heard what Sylvia said the other night. Val and I coaxed her out and bought her some drinks.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What did she say?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why should I tell you?&quot; he says &quot;You weren&apos;t there to hear it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My eyes return to the ground. I built walls around a tightness in my chest, and for a second, I catch myself thinking he understands.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin says, &quot;I get why you&apos;re upset. We&apos;re all going through change. All those cadets and their foursome Fireteams might never talk again. It&apos;s so hard to believe that, especially after every group has been together this long.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re right. It&apos;s just been hard,&quot; I say, because lying is easy. I&apos;ve practiced so many times on my younger sister Ellie that it&apos;s second nature. &quot;It&apos;s just the guilt of all those cadets that aren&apos;t going to make it,&quot; I come up with.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s not your fault.&quot; He places his hand on my shoulder. &quot;If leading the Carmine has taught me anything, it&apos;s that people are addicted to a free ride, and none want to pay the ticket when it&apos;s due.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The civvies call us suicide scholars for a reason. The money is tempting. And yet, regardless of all that empty land near the outer walls, they never seem to run out of space.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;But it&apos;s not your fault,&quot; Romin repeats. &quot;You don&apos;t get to feel guilty for succeeding when we were only born into this system. We earned this. We signed up for this just like they did. You can&apos;t achieve anything without stepping on someone else, so you might as well do it with force.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But some of them were born just for the stipend,&quot; I say. &quot;And others are adopted, like me, for that same reason.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, come on. Your mother and father loved you!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Emilia loved me,&quot; I say. &quot;And ever since that night, I&apos;ve done it all alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ve all been alone. Wading through so much shit we lost all sense of smell. But there&apos;s something more, waiting after all of that. Can&apos;t you feel it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;That bottomless pit in my stomach. </p>
<p>&emsp;The guilt of inaction. </p>
<p>&emsp;The fear of every possibility forking everywhere at the same time, and always wondering if I lost the true path some0time long ago.</p>
<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;Maybe I&apos;ve always felt it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;This is a new beginning, Titus. Leaders do nothing compared to the weaker ones below them. We&apos;ll be serving the acolytes of the Gods whose prayer feeds our entire city. Above the clouds where Essence will keep us warm. And we&apos;ll be doing nothing &mdash; who fights the chosen ones in the central peaks of the Afterlife? Who bites the hand that feeds them? And after service, we&apos;ll settle down. You and Sylvia, and me and Valentina &mdash; unless I hit it off with some divine broad up there.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;d do that?&quot; I ask. &quot;You&apos;d betray us so easily?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Never. You&apos;re my best friend. I&apos;d never leave you behind.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s what I thought.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;...Unless you got in my way,&quot; he says.</p>

<p>&emsp;Romin runs his mouth further, his words stoking our conversation like a fire on its last log. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, but seriously. Sylvia might be tall and thick, but Valentina&apos;s that perfect kind of short, you know? Like, thick-short. but the good kind of thick, and the good kind of short. Like trees versus shrubs, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I laugh. &quot;I don&apos;t know, Romin.&quot; He passes a sip from his bottle of cinnamon whisky to give a nice warmth without heat. The liquor stings my throat as his two neurons debate what he&apos;s going to say next. He&apos;s pretty good in school, yet I wonder if the only functioning parts of his intoxicated brain are women and combat.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Valentina&apos;s got that feminine charm, too. It&apos;s why she&apos;s so popular. It&apos;s why she&apos;s been an actress in all the Academy flicks &mdash; hic &mdash; and why she&apos;s so famous,&quot; he says. &quot;To be a daughter of the Merlot &mdash; with all that wealth and power &mdash; that persona is what makes you feel so high and unreachable to everyone else. That&apos;s the true definition of power. And she can help me get there, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s eyes glass over like marbles with a familiar glance. It&apos;s the same gaze when he looks upon the statue of his brother, immortalized in bronze, holding the sword that supposedly impaled him when he was serving out beyond the walls fighting the Chymaera. I&apos;m not surprised when he brings him up again.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Funny how the anniversary of Ryder&apos;s sacrifice comes around at the same time that we graduate. It&apos;s too bad he can&apos;t see how the Carmine of our district celebrate him,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s the only thing that sucks about dying, with the warrior&apos;s fate that awaits us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not getting to see the people back home carry your name. My statue&apos;s gonna be massive, you know. Bigger than . . . well, very big.&quot; He hesitates.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I hope your statue is looking up, at least,&quot; I tell him. &quot;From how flat your head is after your mother never turned you, I bet the brothers of the Carmine could fry an egg on there if they ever got hungry.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He rubs sweat from his skull. &quot;Not a chance!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I guess it never gets warm enough,&quot; I say.  &quot;Unless your ego was trapped in there. Then brothers could use it as a hand-warmer after a long day&apos;s work!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That statue would melt,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I add, &quot;just from catching rays of light on all that surface. They&apos;ll have to depict you a lot smaller, but you don&apos;t mind, do you? Gods above, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s enough metal in all of Blackwater.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re not calling me fat, are you? It&apos;s muscle,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;re a twig. I bet even Sylvia could crush you if she wasn&apos;t so busy with her soft hobbies all the time...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Taller doesn&apos;t mean stronger,&quot; I say, huffing between breaths. Laughter draws a cough, and the back of my throat stings. It always feels like any meaningful talk between us gets derailed by playful insults. So I bring us back. &quot;But do you like it?&quot; I asked him. &quot;The Carmine, I mean. You were kind of born into it without a choice.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course I do,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m the future of the clan. One day I&apos;ll lead the whole district. How could I not be proud of that?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He beats his chest in pride. All I can think of is the medical report on his desk I stumbled upon days earlier, from his fifth visit to the medics that month. I didn&apos;t know if it was the smoking or the drinking &mdash; but it said he had ulcers, and the heart of someone twice his age.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Enough about me and Val, then,&quot; Romin says, &quot;what about Sylvia? What do you like about her so much?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I liked her before I learned true human nature. In our culture is a nature of apathy towards children who share no familial blood. The value of a family is constituted by the strength of its children, and their service as Cadets in the Academy. The higher their echelon &mdash; the higher their children&apos;s class in the Academy &mdash; the greater the stipend that family receives, so I spent my whole childhood being dissuaded that any kind of love could be unrequited.</p>
<p>&emsp;I was only eight years old when I started training myself, beaten down by kids twice my size, making fun of me for entering Seminary combat school two years early, just because of how badly I longed for a chance to be worthy. All the strongest kids were taken from the orphanage. My room was next to Sylvia&apos;s, and both our windows faced the entry walkway, watching daily as child-after-child was taken to a new home. Those kids achieved something in those fleeting moments we could only ever watch with sickening envy, and all we could do was wonder what was wrong with us. That competitiveness conjured a cruelty among the children that could have cut us deep. That was, not unless we built something stronger; not if one of us was able to protect the other.</p>
<p>&emsp;I learned more about fighting in the orphanage than I did in any combat school. The malice of that toxicity &mdash; not just among the children, but the caregivers who weren&apos;t paid enough to care &mdash; bred it even further. I passed Sylvia words of reassurance when the crimson ring of her iris led her to the name &quot;Blood Eyes.&quot; I fought with my fists and teeth to protect her. If no one was around to keep me safe or show me love, then I would incarnate it. When I watched the reprieve in her eyes when I defended her, I could live through it. I could feel through it, visualizing as if our roles were switched, that intangible, unconditional love I lusted for so strongly, resting in Sylvia&apos;s respite, and I tried to imagine how it felt. I knew it was selfish. All I could accept was that these circumstances had broken me. I could never accept the fa ade of love, hidden behind so many layers of primal, selfish desire, but there was something special with her, that she knew me before that, that she stayed with me all this time for some reason beyond logic. All I know is that it was never love, but something else, something&mdash;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus!&quot; He shoulders me lightly, still enough to nearly send me into a snowbank. &quot;Are you gonna dream about her, or give me an answer?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s nice,&quot; I tell Romin. &quot;And with her medical specialization, she&apos;s really smart about that stuff.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;Even after I was adopted four years later, taken in by a new caretaker that arrived at the orphanage, the pressure to perform still follows me. My adoptive mother Emilia always said she fell in love with me. My combat skills were pretty impressive by that point, and my knowledge was three grades ahead, so I guessed I earned it. But it was always that smolder in my mother&apos;s eyes when she watched me that made me uncomfortable: as if she loved me for something else, but I never came to understand. I found that same look in Sylvia&apos;s eyes whenever I talked to her.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because she&apos;s nice?&quot; Romin asks. &quot;Every other day you&apos;re in her room,&quot; he says. &quot;I know you&apos;re not talking. And I don&apos;t need to check her room for dents behind the headboard.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ve never made it that far. Honest,&quot; I say. &quot;We&apos;re close friends: it&apos;d be too uncomfortable.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He stops so I have to turn to meet his eyes through the slit of a face-wrapped scarf. His glare tries to break the tell, but there&apos;s nothing else there.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Honest,&quot; I mumble from beneath the fabric.</p>
<p>&emsp;He continues dragging the sled. &quot;Yeah. Friends, huh,&quot; Romin says. He takes the last swig of his bottle before throwing it aside &mdash; washing that word out as if the scotch were less bitter. &quot;I&apos;m pretty sure you&apos;re more than that.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Silence hangs between us again. Men don&apos;t always have to talk: their minds can race on nothing unless interrupted. Romin is a talkative drunk, but after so many nights out, we always expect to find him snoring in a corner once the liquor runs out. But soon we&apos;ll approach the safehouse that provides our shelter for the night: the station I&apos;ve visited hundreds of times before, the same dot on the map etched in my mind from years of travel. </p>
<p>&emsp;The same brand of anxiety that kept me at the top of my game settles on the fear of this long distance from the walls: not the eerie silence that&apos;s almost become nostalgic, but the fact that this is the farthest I&apos;ve ever gone. It&apos;s a trip that lasts more than a single night, and it almost bothers me more that I&apos;m unafraid.</p>
<p>&emsp;Why do I feel that I am going to die out here? Is that what I want? Am I one of those suicide scholars that takes their own life before the service? My future isn&apos;t beyond the walls. It&apos;s in serving in the lands above. But that crescendo of circles on the map left by my grandfather&mdash;far outside the two-day-trip circle I charted in my own ink&mdash;leads me onward on one final Snowdrifting expedition. All I can hope to find is one thing: what that wordless, regretful terror was that consumed him in the end, when the ability to sleep was stolen from him by the Chymaeran Curse. His hands trembled. His writing accelerated. He mumbled and cried about something he had forgotten. They told us he died in his sleep, but I knew that was a lie. He stayed awake for a full month before he died&mdash;the autopsy says his brain dissolved to a tenth of its size. </p>
<p>&emsp;How could you tell it was the curse? I asked. </p>
<p>&emsp;Because brain matter doesn&apos;t glow purple, they said.</p>

<p>&emsp;The safehouse is the same as I left it. It doesn&apos;t surprise me. Few Snowdrifters would ever dare to travel this far. I can tell, as soon as I find the strategic surplus of spare rations I left months before in the corner, the only reflective thing unsullied by layers of dust&mdash;beyond the drag marks on the table when I swiped a silver candlestick. </p>
<p>&emsp;The building was once a two-bedroom cabin, but there&apos;s only one now. I was ecstatic when I found it a few years back, because it has a stone fireplace. When I rushed through the house to take a survey of the rooms by opening all the doors, I was surprised to find the master bedroom  was remodeled to a snow-covered balcony after the roof collapsed. I sealed off the door two trips ago to keep the heat inside, because no amount of Essence can ever acclimate a house to heat when there&apos;s a broken window or a cracked door.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I think I&apos;ll continue this drunk until we get back,&quot; Romin says. &quot;I saw the rations, did you leave the liquor, too?&quot; He inspects the bottles on the shelf above the roaring fireplace. &quot;I&apos;ve never even heard of this stuff before.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He uncorks the bottle, releasing a long-fermenting odor into the air that makes him gag. He hesitates. A few seconds later, he cautiously draws a sip to his lips, tasting it like he&apos;s one of those refined Vermillions as he swishes the bottle around, aerating the long-aged liquor like a dog lapping water. Satisfied, he shrugs at me, continuing to chug several more gulps of it.</p>
<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;You know, there&apos;s Merlotan royals that would probably pay a hundred Kine just for a shot of that. We&apos;d probably sell it if they ever came down to our shop themselves, instead of sending their servants.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He clutches his chest and grunts. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods above, this must be what that Chymaeran Curse is like. It feels like death, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A lot of things feel like death,&quot; I say. </p>
<p>&emsp;Together, we look out through the tears in the sheet that insulates the window. The sun dips below the horizon, casting shadows across all the landscape. It never gets high enough to brighten the world without help from electric light, but nor does it ever dip low enough for its influence to disappear completely. Though it hides behind the hills, it leaves an eerie glow in the sky, illuminating the two moons in pale green and ruddy orange.</p>
<p>&emsp;Soon the world beyond the glass dissolves to colorless shadows, like sleep, as a yawn escapes me. The fireplace keeps our ears from ringing with the gentle cracks and pops from the logs, catalyzed by Romin&apos;s  hundred-Kine pours and a whole lot of powdery, dead Essence. </p>
<p>&emsp;The Essence casts the fire in bright crimson, making the smoke smell of ozone, and when our eyes adjust to the blackness as much as they can, I can tell what Romin searches for.</p>
<p>&emsp;He stands at the window.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Veins of amethyst in the trees, huh?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s what it says in all the books. Those Chymaeran savages seem to leave everything dead in their wake. &apos;Only a single glow left to show they were ever there.&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Death might be freezing, but I think north of the capital is too cold. Even for them,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No wonder the rail lines ship out east. That&apos;s where they say the front lines are, where they&apos;ll send all the classes below us. That&apos;s where they sent my brother. He was among the top of his class, you know, like you, but he volunteered for it. Can you believe that? He said he wanted a &apos;life of adventure.&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I hope you&apos;re not looking for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, no. I was born with a far more refined taste,&quot; Romin says. &quot;There&apos;s too many things to conquer in this world beyond battles. Women. Work. Strength &mdash; you know, I&apos;m not gonna fit in my coffin when I die,&quot; he says, taking another swig from the bottle that made him gag. He squints his eyes, still trying to make out the amethyst veins. &quot;Say. The Chymaerans,&quot; he asks. &quot;Have you ever seen one of them?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Never,&quot; I say. Romin looks disappointed: all he brought was food, booze and weapons, and I&apos;m pretty sure he hoped to use all three of them. &quot;Just frozen corpses,&quot; I say. &quot;And their veins weren&apos;t purple with the Chymaeran Curse. Their bodies didn&apos;t decay to ash from it, either.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But what did them in?&quot; Romin asks, turning back to the warmth of the fire.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They were greedy with their time, taking too much, and they didn&apos;t head back early,&quot; I say. &quot;First rule is that there&apos;s always another trip.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s hands tremble as he tries to hinge his fingers, reaching closer towards the flames. &quot;What do they look like? Have you seen one? I mean, in a whole decade out here, you had to have seen something, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;d think I would. You&apos;ve heard the descriptions of them, though. Their race is tall, obsidian color, absorbing any brightness . . . like the opposite of light, hard-shelled and solid on the outside.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And they say they take the faces of their victims,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Carmine records say you can&apos;t even recognize the difference. And the longer they take your identity, the better they get at being you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I laugh. &quot;Those are Academy wives&apos; tales. The instructors tell that to scare new cadets.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s written in our history. The Carmine preserve everything the city tries to bury. We preserve all the Humans&apos; past, all that stuff the Merlot and the city try to hide. They&apos;re not a legend. They&apos;re out there, and they&apos;re very real.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;And I believe, too. While the Humans control life and heat, the Chymaera control frost and death, and I have secondhand evidence of their latter strength. It was what I witnessed as the second death of my grandfather. His first death was five years ago, when the Chymaeran Curse overtook him: the amethyst in his veins, the deterioration of his mind to the point that my father Clint wouldn&apos;t let me visit him. He wrote and scribbled for years, driven mad by the passion of a single thought. In my hands was the map he left my father and I, etched with the locations of landmarks beyond the walls. And with graduation, I know this is my last chance to reach the spot that Everett marked with a climax of circles.</p>
<p>&emsp;After several hours of listening to gale, haunting winds between pops of the smoldering logs, exhaustion outpaces our primal fears. And as the fire fades to ash and soot, we fall asleep beneath the blankets we brought on the sleds. My fingers hinge around the necklace my mother left me. Despite the cold, its black, crystalline surface is even colder.</p>
<p>&emsp;Sleep finds us quickly. We find ourselves alive and freezing the next morning: at least not cold enough to become frosthards. The last material Romin wants for his statue is ice, and the last place he wants it is forgotten with another several hundred years of history, forever lost beyond the walls. </p>
<p>&emsp;After I dress myself in the same clothes hardened with sweat from yesterday&apos;s travels, drink fresh water from melted snow, and consume half of the remaining rations I left in the corner, we release the makeshift locks and crack open the front door to blinding white.</p>
<p>&emsp;The lack of footprints sets us in an uncomfortable ease, as if amethyst veins in tree bark or the smell of ozone could sift the air when we least expect it. Romin sweats bullets as if he can use them as ammunition, still wearing a belt of two revolvers he fetched from the Carmine armory, making the dagger in my belt feel archaic. You need them. They&apos;ll get to you faster than you can reload, but if your sword and bow are steady... the instructors always said. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s roll,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Peak daylight will be gone before we know it.&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;The second day is faster when the sleds are lighter. We&apos;re almost there: all we&apos;re doing is stopping by to scavenge whatever Everett&apos;s scratchings left for us. Time passes rapidly when Romin never runs out of things to talk about.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s enough about me,&quot; he says. &quot;What do you want to know about me?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;We meander around Everett&apos;s spot for an hour, until we find a single house nestled between the hills, finding log posts that faintly mark the boundary of the small estate.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Surely this is it,&quot; I say. &quot;There isn&apos;t anything else out here.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why have a fence if nature is your only neighbor?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;We toss the leads of our sleds in the snow, preparing ourselves to enter. After trying the knob, I nod to Romin, built in just the shape to get us inside. He smirks, relishing the rare chance to helpfully break something.</p>
<p>&emsp;The door takes a full shoulder before it gives. The hinges screech from beyond a century of snow-borne rust as chips of pine wood tear from the bottom, leaving the door with jagged, gnashing teeth. It siphons the outside air as if the house has lungs to breathe, exhaling a putrid smell of age.</p>
<p>&emsp;The house&apos;s siding groans as it breathes wind into its lungs, and a single chandelier hangs from the wooden cross-beam like a tonsil. Dormant lanterns circle the chains as crystalline fragments shimmer&mdash;if Valentina was here, it would surely remind her of her lavish estate in the foothills. There are no voices outside the walls like our apartments at the Academy, but even in the silence, Romin and I feel that we are being watched.</p>
<p>&emsp;It feels as if some agent consumes all the light in the house, opposite of how light bulbs and lanterns throw their colors. Romin drags a match against the strip of the matchbox, but the box is wet, and he tries drying it off with his shirt. </p>
<p>&emsp;Impatient, I fumble around. With the ancient curtains still drawn, light struggles to filter through the fabric. But we&apos;re lucky that the horrors of this scene don&apos;t present themselves on their own.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin sputters one in sparks. He curses, and light catches a glint in the floor&mdash;is it wet? Glass? Our ancestors beyond the walls couldn&apos;t make floors out of anything other than wood. In the second breadth of darkness, my leg catches a wetness.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin drags another. It snaps. &quot;Khiras above,&quot; he curses, before taking out another.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t use the whole box, we only just got here,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Hold it sideways,&quot; expecting a whine or a punch in the shoulder. But he&apos;s too focused, an oversized toddler playing with fire.</p>
<p>&emsp;The third one lights, casting flickering shadows on the walls as if we&apos;re huddled in a cave, and neither of us are prepared for the sight. </p>
<p>&emsp;The manifestation of an ancient bloodbath comes into focus, painted across the floors as if the glass of the red paintings had shattered under pressure and spilled their contents. A paralyzing fear seizes me. My mind races. My stomach lurches. And now the putrid smell makes sense, the odor that first hit us when we entered. </p>
<p>&emsp;My eyes glance at the map, as if we found the wrong house. The bass in Romin&apos;s voice echoes, but it lacks emotion. &quot;Gods,&quot; he says. We step into the kitchen, where ancient puddles of crimson once caked the floors, kept wet by some form of moisture that condenses in the room, keeping the smell alive. The bones must have been picked apart by animal scavengers: the meat left clean like a rib roast in the dining halls after a hundred starving cadets.</p>
<p>&emsp;I throw my bag on the counter, scattering journals and notebooks and pages and artifacts&mdash;I brought everything I inherited from my grandfather. Romin passes across the carpet with a lantern. His fingers trace desperate scratches on a locked door, followed by jagged, splintered teeth around the doorknob as if someone had tried to break in, bludgeoned indentations that grew weaker and weaker further down. &quot;Fridging Chymaerans. Must have been trying to break in&mdash;the rest of the family hid in here,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;But there&apos;s no trace of Chymaeran Essence along the corpses&apos; scratches. Sylvia once told me that when Human blood and Chymaeran Essence make contact, it glows purple, then leaves a dry chalk residue. It&apos;s what the Chymaeran curse does to the blood. It&apos;s what killed Everett.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So, it wasn&apos;t a Chymaeran attack,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Then was it animals? Or . . . was it Human? </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why would Humans be out here this far? It doesn&apos;t make sense,&quot; I say. &quot;Four-day trips are unheard of.&quot; I scan Everett&apos;s documents and notebooks, and across all of them is the same insignia, the same set of strokes on the stationery my grandfather spilled his last thoughts on. Same with the map, we had been using this map for years &mdash; all the houses, all the terrain other explorers hadn&apos;t charted, beyond the walls, beyond the eyes&apos; reach of the train tracks, all the creases and folds that had been left to my grandfather&apos;s memories, and all those X&apos;es had been circling around one location, where the desperation of Everett&apos;s brainless scratchings reached a crescendo, as if all his cerebral emotions of some long-passed moment had bled in warning. </p>
<p>&emsp;This map isn&apos;t for treasure. It never was.</p>
<p>&emsp;And then the realization comes to me. I look at the tattered door. &quot;Gods . . . look at the marks,&quot; I say, and then the size of the clawed scratchings make sense. It wasn&apos;t an animal: they were handprints; tiny, bloody handprints; tiny, bloody, child-sized handprints. </p>
<p>&emsp;Romin doesn&apos;t bother trying the handle: he can&apos;t stand the thought as an impressionable mentor for the young Carmine. A hundred years dead or not, his kick bludgeons the door in a shower of splinters, and the rancid odor of death grows stronger. The room was some kind of study. The west-facing window glows in dying light as if the entire room were preserved perfectly in amber. </p>
<p>&emsp;Silence sweeps over us for several minutes as we meander about the scene, until Romin&apos;s voice severs it. Something has been bothering him. &quot;They weren&apos;t protecting themselves,&quot; he says, &quot;it just doesn&apos;t make sense. It had to have been something else.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Un-shattered glass in the study, the windows still intact, all locked in the down position&mdash;you see this door locks from the inside, and it was locked.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;If the windows are intact, they stayed in here. They didn&apos;t try to leave. The coward inside left the children out there! Why did they stay in the room? Against whatever &mdash; or whoever &mdash; was in here, why didn&apos;t they escape out the window?&quot; His fingers feel the window lock: still tight against the panes of glass, and he begins to fervently scan the study. </p>
<p>&emsp;My stomach turns with the setting sun. Anxiety begins to build. If we don&apos;t leave now, we&apos;re not getting out of here tonight. The sickness of that fills my chest with claustrophobic shadow. &quot;I&apos;m not sleeping here tonight. We don&apos;t have lumber or Essence for a fire, it&apos;s all at the storehouse. We&apos;ll freeze if we&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just hold up,&quot; Romin says, as darkness crests the horizon somewhere beyond the window. The dusk feels like a cold, viscous fluid seeping into vacant space. It feels like diving to the furthest bottom of a lake, crossing that threshold where the return is questionable, where breath is a treasured commodity. Never have I been this far out, and the paranoia of all my first fears as a Snowdrifter quickly come back to me. The sky is dark. The spaces between the trees become more indiscernible, and as the black-and-white vision in my eyes slowly takes over, anything and everything looks like an amethyst glow. I thought I had outgrown this amateur&apos;s fear, and for a second I almost think I smell ozone in the air.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;Let&apos;s go, Romin,&quot; I say, &quot;let&apos;s go, let&apos;s get out of here, it&apos;s way too late, and we&apos;re not staying here tonig&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll be fine, Titus,&quot; Romin says, &quot;we can stay here. Look.&quot; He pulls out a pouch with the Carmine crest on it, withdrawing the string, and a faint crimson glow emanates from the bag. &quot;This was only for emergency&mdash;scarce enough as it already is. The Carmine holds a small reserve the city doesn&apos;t know about.&quot; I peek. Inside is even more dead Essence, ten times as combustible as gunpowder, enough to last us a hundred nights or blow the house and everything in eyeshot to the sky.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Fine,&quot; I say, trying to mask the tremor in my voice. Whatever gets us the best haul is all that matters. All I can think of is my sister Ellie, my duty to protect her and raise her, and it terrifies me to think of a world where she lives without me.</p>
<p>&emsp;As Romin stokes the fireplace, all I can think of were the last words I exchanged with Ellie, the bitterness of that last moment. There is no nature to hear beyond the walls of the house; all that meets us is tinnitus. It feels as if we float in nonexistence, in a vacuous sheet of null space lined with trees. It&apos;s as if time doesn&apos;t exist here; a place where news and sound of the industry doesn&apos;t travel; where the smell of sickening smoke doesn&apos;t reach; the only proof of continuity of nature in the migration of the two moons and a blanket of stars above us.</p>

<p>&emsp;The dying fire we lit off of Romin&apos;s Essence crackles like dry leaves, popping and sputtering as it succumbs to the cold. Romin snores in short starts and stops, too patternless to be anything close to white noise, but it doesn&apos;t matter.</p>
<p>&emsp;I won&apos;t sleep tonight, anyways. Once I get over the fear of our distance, surrounded by a scene of carnage without Romin&apos;s witticisms to make me forget, my thoughts bottom out into the guilt I brought with me, riding the residual anguish of our last exchange. I pray to the Gods that one day she&apos;ll understand that I never meant to hurt her; that she&apos;ll see how hard I fight for her, even if I&apos;m not around to explain.</p>

<p>&emsp;It was the morning before we left: the last errand before Romin and I met at my father&apos;s shop.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Look, look,&quot; Ellie said, &quot;Look, did you see? There&apos;s letters on the walls.&quot; She tensioned her frozen fingers between my hands, dragging me from the footpath.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Those are names,&quot; I said. &quot;People put their names there before they leave to protect our city. They etch them in there.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But why?&quot; my sister asked.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re stalling,&quot; I said. &quot;You have to get to school, so let&apos;s&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just tell me!&quot; she shouts, standing still as cardstock. &quot;Just tell me, Tie.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I checked my watch. Every morning was a rush when our father slept at his shop. But I was thankful &mdash; those mornings, the smell of alcohol on his breath was enough to make my sister uncomfortable. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They put them there to be remembered. It&apos;s really dangerous out there, you know. It&apos;s cold. It&apos;s colder than it is along the outer city walls. &quot; She traced her fingers along the indentations of a stone marked CHESTER COLEMAN. The date read a hundred years ago. &quot;This one was one of the first. In fact, it was almost a hundred years ago our city started doing this, after the fall of the capital city.&quot; Snow saturated the sharp contours of the carving, leaving the name nearly lost to time. I looked up to the top of the walls: the furthest boulders so small they appeared like grains of sand, still etched with names as far as I could see, and only several hundred were marked with the triumphant &apos;X&apos; that denoted a cadet&apos;s return. I prayed to the Gods the survivors had just forgotten to mark them. After I passed the Outer Gates, would any eyes ever read my name upon the wall?</p>
<p>&emsp;Ellie caught me lost in thought again &mdash; she is good at it. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s go. We can&apos;t be late like yesterday,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I&apos;m not stalling,&quot; Ellie said, tensioning her grasp further. &quot;I just want to be with you for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know, I know. But I&apos;ll&mdash;&quot; pick you up after? Careful. &quot;I&apos;ll see you in a few days,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;A few days?&quot; she asked. &quot;That&apos;s so long!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I have to go beyond the walls again. Dad needs more goods for the rummage store. More antiques to sell. He&apos;s got buyers lined up, so we need fresh stock.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Boo,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s okay, though. Valentina&apos;s drivers will be here after Seminary to pick you up.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s not! Why doesn&apos;t Daddy pick me up? I haven&apos;t seen him in days,&quot; she said. &quot;He&apos;s worse than Mom, and Mom is still away.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Her words stick like shrapnel. Clint seems to find his only comfort in the portrait behind the counter: the metallic corners worn to fillets from his fingers. His same grasp holds the store as it sifts like sand through his fingers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He won&apos;t be back tonight. But I&apos;ll be back soon. I promise. Then we can do something fun.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But why?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s for our future, and your future. And your education,&quot; I say, but Ellie&apos;s hands balled into fists, straining her skin as her nails bit into her flesh. &quot;I promise. I&apos;m really trying&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not fair!&quot; she says, stamping her feet. &quot;Why can&apos;t you be here? Why does everyone leave me? Why does everyone hate me?&quot; The emptiness in her gaze stretched on with a thousand-yard stare: not into my eyes, but through me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I hoped my warmth would suffice for reason. &quot;I love you, Ellie,&quot; I say. &quot;I love you more than anything. But there&apos;s someone in every family who has to fight for it.&quot; I held the back of her head to my shoulder like our mother once did to me. </p>
<p>&emsp;But she resisted the warmth of my embrace. Her arms dangled in protest. Not seeing her mother or father probably made her wonder if she was ever born at all. And as an adoptee from the orphanage, I knew exactly how that felt.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I love you,&quot; I told her. &quot;I promise I&apos;ll come back soon.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You always do this, Tie.&quot; She twisted from my grasp. &quot;I hate this life here. Daddy says I can live somewhere else, but you won&apos;t let me. I hate you! Why can&apos;t you just let me go?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She disappeared into the Seminary doors before I could call out to her, her tiny hands clasped around the lunch I packed for her. I hoped she read the note I left in there, every day reminding her how much I loved her &mdash; even if it did nothing, it was the persistence that was worth it. All I could think of was how much I wished I could leave more. Or something more permanent &mdash; something that would stay with her. How will she remember me?</p>

<p>&emsp;My mind is restless. I have to keep moving, I have to do something. I can&apos;t sleep on the carpet stained with blood, so I scrounge around. A golden corner protrudes from the bag that Romin strapped around his shoulders, and I pull the item out to satiate my ravenous curiosity.</p>
<p>&emsp;I wrap myself in two blankets before I crack the spine of the book. The darkness makes it difficult to discern the black font from the vellum. I light a candle, primed with a pinch of Romin&apos;s Essence, and it throws crimson light on the walls of the foyer, illuminating the pages.</p>
<p>&emsp;Before I could read, I looked upon Everett&apos;s books in his library in awe of their black-ink artistry&mdash;scribed in forbidden ink. The weathered pages made me wonder their age, and Everett told me they recorded the world before the Fall of Nordhaven, before the moment that the Chymaeran extremists liquidated our capital city, killing the original royal family and forcing us to retreat to the city of Blackwater.</p>
<p>&emsp;This book is so similar. Illustrations of a feline race called the Ahkvas line the pages: drawings of landscapes with plants so tall you can&apos;t see the sky from the ground, and another race of creatures with wings, another like plants, and so many others I can&apos;t distinguish. Fine-gritted rocks stretch over endless landscapes in places so dry they don&apos;t get any water. There are bodies of water filled with salt that stretch so far you can&apos;t see the end of them&mdash;to imagine salt as something so common!</p>
<p>&emsp;But it&apos;s towards the end that the illustrations surprise me. The chapter reads AND NOW, THE GREAT CITY OF BLACKWATER. </p>
<p>&emsp;The illustrations are indiscernible. Luscious landscapes stretch just beyond the city. Vines cascade from the city walls: I recognize them as the center walls, the original bounds of the city before the Fall forced our people to expand. And in the center are the great peaks of The Afterlife: shrouded in clouds, in great mystery to anyone living below them. After all, the only contact to those Acolytes who connect with the Gods are the Merlot, Valentina&apos;s folk; the city&apos;s active government officials who carry out Their commands and distribute Their gifts.</p>
<p>&emsp;At first, I think I see the Chymaerans attacking the Humans in the following pages. But I&apos;m wrong. They&apos;re tending fields together. They&apos;re working in cooperation with the Humans. Captions read THE UNION OF LIFE AND DEATH and BLACKWATER: UNION IN DICHOTOMY.</p>
<p>&emsp;I wish such stories survived to stir the souls of our citizens, not burned en-masse in the great book burnings. The Merlot tell us of the strength in severing ourselves from that past, making ourselves stronger, raising our children to fight and defend the last foothold of the Humans so the Chymaera can&apos;t extinguish our people and our light. They tell us there is no space for fairy tales &mdash; that they distract us from true purpose, from the calling to forge a new golden age for our people.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s snore pulls me back to the present moment. The Essence we lined in all the candles runs low, and I pray the heat will last us the rest of the night. I think of Ellie and Sylvia. I imagine their disheartened faces if I failed to return.</p>
<p>&emsp;My eyes grow heavy as my fingers reach to close the book. It catches itself on the last page of an inscription addressed in ink. To Ullrich, Evella, young Fletcher and Lyra: the next golden age lies in our blood.</p>
<p>&emsp;With love, Everett.</p>

<p>&emsp;Romin awakens to find the house torn apart even further.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I should have known that map wasn&apos;t for treasure,&quot; I say, my skin pallid from a sleepless night without warmth. I breathe between my palms. &quot;Did you read the inscription on the book you found?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, I just liked the pictures,&quot; Romin says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I snort. &quot;You oversized toddler.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;My father and I thought Everett&apos;s map charted the houses and landmarks he found. But this wasn&apos;t any stranger&apos;s house.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because that book you found was inside this house,&quot; I say. &quot;And it was addressed by my grandfather himself.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So?&quot; He asks.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;So this was his house! Or he knew the people here, a long, long time ago. I&apos;ve been looking all morning for more clues. I tore through bookshelf after bookshelf, looking for notes, photographs, anything . . . but it&apos;s almost as if this whole house was already cased. It just feels like things are conveniently missing.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin is smart with this stuff: if being a Snowdrifter is my world, this is entirely his. &quot;I work repossessions with Carmine business. Nobody hides anything from us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Doesn&apos;t everything feel like it&apos;s already been combed through?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin says, &quot;It does. Low-value items laid out&mdash;you see, to hide their things, they&apos;d arrange their house so neatly you&apos;d think they weren&apos;t hiding anything at all. That&apos;s why my suspicion&mdash;&quot; he says, tracing the corner of the wall again until he returns to the office, feeling for frayed carpet fibers and shifting his weight to feel the wooden planks beneath the surface.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s absurd why anybody would hide something valuable in a house like this,&quot; I say. &quot;This far from the walls? Wouldn&apos;t it be better guarded in a castle or a grand estate?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;d be surprised,&quot; he says. &quot;Most houses built before the Fall of Nordhaven, stone ones like this, had hollow floor spaces. And in a room like the office...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The carpet folds backwards in the corner. Beyond our lanterns, first light catches a reflection off the rectangular lid of an aluminum tin.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is that?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;Not sure yet.&quot; Romin&apos;s fingers fondle for an edge until he lifts it from the hollowed crevice. It looks like a munitions box, but a lot heavier: the walls so thick it surely wasn&apos;t stamped out of sheets of steel. </p>
<p>&emsp;After assessing the weight of the thing inside it, he triumphantly hands it to me. &quot;That might be a free month with your sister,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I shake it. Something heavy clangs inside, giving off a curious energy that stands my hairs on end, and I mutter words of disbelief.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Valentina calls my line of work criminal. But I&apos;m glad at least someone can appreciate it,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope it pays back for the night here.&quot; Without the Essence in his bag, there&apos;s no chance we could have made it.</p>
<p>&emsp;The metal box emits an energy stronger than his bag of Essence. We hastily gather our things and leave as soon as we can.</p>

<p>&emsp;No grand welcome awaits us as we enter the walls two days later, early that morning, exhausted. I foolishly wonder if my father or Ellie are worried about me, concerned I made it back a day late. Romin parts for the Carmine compound. I crack open the front door of the shop, unloading belongings, but my father Clint isn&apos;t inside. He knows our protocol &mdash; is he contacting the emergency patrol? Is he putting in a notice about my disappearance, or worse, did he go looking for me? I let the thoughts flood my mind before I remember what I&apos;ve always been to him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, Titus,&quot; Clint says. &quot;Took you damn long enough.&quot;</p>
