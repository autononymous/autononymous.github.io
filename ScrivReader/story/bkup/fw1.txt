- Power tug-of-war with constant shifting of who has the upper hand.
- Reluctant respect expressed internally, and unwanted awareness of sexual details that make them scold themselves.
- Lots of proximity and pinning and accidental contact.
- Mirroring of the two of them that they resist.
- Believable opposition to each other without resolution.
- Show one's vulnerability to the other.
- Protection with denial: one protects the other but "not because they like them or anything."
