    "Content":"<table><tr><td>ever since that fateful first night   </td><td>  when i crossed back through the door</td></tr><tr><td>that led me to another world   </td><td>  i made absolutely sure that</td></tr><tr><td>it was sealed shut to stop  </td><td>  the intruder on the other side,</td></tr><tr><td>that psycho cosplayer with a knife  </td><td>  could never disturb my peace again.</td></tr><tr><td> she slashed me across the hand.  </td><td>  the drunken thief broke in,</td></tr><tr><td>and little does that bitch know  </td><td>  and little does that bastard know</td></tr><tr><td>that my cousin has a fucking law degree:  </td><td>  i’m a well-trained royal guard and</td></tr><tr><td>she won’t be laughing when she thinks she’ll  </td><td>  have the upper hand in any fight, and</td></tr><tr><td>win. all she probably does is stream all day  </td><td>  as a woman that wears knights’ armor,</td></tr><tr><td>making e-girl money from her fans’ donations.  </td><td>  he thinks he can beat me, but i destroyed him.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>maybe i should report her bitch-ass to the irs.  </td><td>  there’s not a chance they do anything helpful.</td></tr><tr><td>her yellow color contacts and realistic sword?  </td><td>  wearing nobleman’s clothes? i admit that</td></tr><tr><td>she surely has the body for it. i know the type:  </td><td>  they’re attractive, but pathetic weaklings,</td></tr><tr><td>ones like them train abs every day at the gym, and  </td><td>  are not my type at all. the rich always</td></tr><tr><td>  are dependent on daddy and mommy’s money,  </td><td>  going into their father’s exorbitant savings,</td></tr><tr><td>  wasting it all on new cars and houses,  </td><td>  buying wares to advance their family image. </td></tr><tr><td>though she’s shallower than a kiddie pool.  </td><td>  that bastard hasn’t fought a day in his life.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>i’m an engineer at a prestigious aerospace firm.  </td><td>  i’ll remind you that i graduated top of my class</td></tr><tr><td>so i design the future while she’s   </td><td>  in cadet school, a chosen guardian that’s </td></tr><tr><td>trying to decide what livestream to do next,  </td><td>  undergoing a test for a permanent spot and</td></tr><tr><td>freed from any societal responsibility,  </td><td>  eager to please my mentors. I grew up with</td></tr><tr><td> such incredible violence inflicted on me. And  </td><td>  nothing in the village across the lake. Because</td></tr><tr><td>I’ve fought the dull ache of depression since  </td><td>  I’ve always fought the painful sting of anxiety,</td></tr><tr><td>  my brother died in battle right before i started college,  </td><td>  after my father and siblings burned in the siege of hillfar.</td></tr><tr><td>and it’s rough trying to find reasons to continue on.  </td><td>  i learned you can only rebuild when there is nothing left.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  that girl reminds me of my brother in a way.  </td><td>  but that civillian reminds me of my craftsman father.</td></tr><tr><td>it’s because of her everflowing energy. she lives  </td><td>  in a world stained by conflict, there are few that build</td></tr><tr><td>with such passion, wasting her life in a warrior’s role:  </td><td>  an inner space for peace and humor, which is stupid and</td></tr><tr><td>whether it’s real or just costume play,  </td><td>  it is incredibly foolish, because fear is more useful.</td></tr><tr><td>the real world is slow and boring in the modern age, but  </td><td>  in my world the sounds of war echo through the night.</td></tr><tr><td>i truly wouldn’t have it any other way. even if i question  </td><td>  whether i can live past the terrible things i’ve seen is</td></tr><tr><td> the value of my life and often i wonder if it is worth it.  </td><td>  something that i struggle with, knowing that</td></tr><tr><td>  time passes and i find that i have no prospect of love.  </td><td>  my friends outside the guard have husbands but</td></tr><tr><td>i’m just a lonely guy with a new empty house, and  </td><td>  i’m just a hardy tomboy with no feminine charms, and</td></tr><tr><td>i’m still waiting on a promotion that will never come and  </td><td>  besides my distant boyfriend, i’ll never find anyone. so</td></tr><tr><td> pissing away time in the office as it sucks life from me is  </td><td>  all i have left to do, i think, is just give my life in battle.</td></tr><tr><td>all i might do until i die from old age.  </td><td>  i will be alone and abandoned on the battlefield.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>i wish i could find someone to prove me wrong.  </td><td>  i really wish someone would change things up. someone</td></tr><tr><td>  with radiant energy like my roomates in college,  </td><td>  calm and collected and peaceful when everyone is afraid.</td></tr><tr><td>but not that crazy girl on the other side of the wall,  </td><td>  and surely not the wimpy nerd that lives next to me. he’s</td></tr><tr><td>kind of hot but in a crazy psycho way.  </td><td>  only got looks and brains but no spine.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>maybe i can find that sense of passion again if  </td><td>  one day i’ll find that sense of peace again. i think</td></tr><tr><td>i keep dragging myself into work everyday, until  </td><td>  i need to wear down the anguish and cowardice by</td></tr><tr><td>obtaining the faintest shred of recognition.  </td><td>  burying my fears of death:</td></tr><tr><td>  the fear of death is only a professional one.  </td><td>  my fear of death is only a physical one</td></tr><tr><td>but it pales in comparison to how my brother died, </td><td>  and is nothing compared to how my father died,</td></tr><tr><td>freezing with bullet holes in his stomach.  </td><td>  entombed in ashes beneath the old cabin.</td></tr><tr><td>  like his death my world is that of ice, and  </td><td>  like his passing i live inside the burning fire,</td></tr><tr><td>so apathetic to everything i struggle to stay warm.  </td><td>  so afraid of everything that i struggle to cool down.</td></tr><tr><td>god knows i’m on the edge of losing my dream job,  </td><td>  and gods know i’m on the verge of being cast into war,</td></tr><tr><td>without the passion i could swear i once had,  </td><td>  stricken by these pathetic reflexes of fear,</td></tr><tr><td>unable to ask out a high-school crush i work with.  </td><td>  even struggling to connect with the distant man i love.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  and it surely won’t happen if i cant stabilize my stupid</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  feelings as i collapse in weakness to the floor, feeling the</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  blood drain from my extremities as i nearly punch a hole</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  in the stupid door.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>as i sit on the couch for two hours scrolling through  </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>titles on netflix, unable to find anything that even  </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>remotely excites me as i doomscroll on my phone, </td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  i pound relentlessly on the wooden door.</td></tr><tr><td>  </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>that girl pounds restlessly on the wooden door.   </td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  it seems like he might actually not care about me at all.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>it seems like she might actually be in trouble.  </td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>maybe it was a bad idea to bolt the door shut so she  </td><td>  maybe it was a bad idea to throw all those kitchen knives</td></tr><tr><td>couldn’t ambush me at night, when i was in my chonies  </td><td>  at his head, or to pull my sword and slice that serious</td></tr><tr><td>pining for a midnight snack after a long day of nothing.  </td><td>  gash in his hand before asking who he was.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>but i feel the strangest pull that draws me to her.  </td><td>  but i feel the strangest pull that draws me to him.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>a sense of vitality and excitement i long for, with an  </td><td>  a sense of stillness and comfort, with a brave sense of</td></tr><tr><td>energy for life that realizes how special it is.  </td><td>  humor that’s stronger than all i have to fear. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>like someone from my past i struggle to forget.  </td><td>  like someone from my past that i miss so much.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>and with those looks and a killer body that’s kept me up  </td><td>  and with those muscular arms and handsome scruff of</td></tr><tr><td>all those nights i struggle to forget her.  </td><td>  stubble that’s kept him fresh in my mind.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>so i rush to the grage to find the power drill, </td><td>  so i begin to ignite the essenced fire magic in my hands,</td></tr><tr><td>glad there isn’t a security deposit to worry about  </td><td>  pleading as the tears crest my eyes, longing for someone</td></tr><tr><td>when i own the damn place.  </td><td>  to comfort me in a way i’ve never felt.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>and when the door opens,  </td><td>  and when the door opens,</td></tr><tr><td>i see Katiya in an entirely different light.  </td><td>  i see Cody in an entirely different light.</td></tr></table>",
