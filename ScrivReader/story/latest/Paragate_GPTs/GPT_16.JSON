      "&emsp;&quot;I think that will work just fine,&quot; Reed says. &quot;What do you think?&quot;",
      "&emsp;But he&apos;s not talking to me. He&apos;s approached almost every engineer in the office to ask their opinion about his design choices, and now he&apos;s back there with Wilbur, preventing him from dozing back off into his &quot;wake apnea&quot;.",
      "&emsp;I scratch away at the yellow engineering pad, sketching my own ideas instead of relying on others all the damn time. It&apos;s easy to draw in 3D when it&apos;s just a plate with a few holes in it: far different from the radical ideas my adversary is coming up with.",
      "&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s up with all the rounds?&quot; Wilbur asks. &quot;It costs a lot of money to ask the machinist to clean up every edge like that.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Huh. I never thought about that,&quot; Reed says.",
      "&emsp;Because he&apos;s never been in a machine shop, I think to myself.",
      "&emsp;Wilbur rambles for another thirty minutes about the history of drafting. Reed eagerly nods his head, and I think it&apos;s beyond the level where he&apos;s just listening until he can escape. All the while, I consider the different ways I can design the enclosure, sketching several different designs between scrolls through social media to keep up on the people I used to know.",
      "&emsp;He pops up like a jump-scare when I have my head down, trying to skip an ad about a freemium game. &quot;What have you come up with so far?&quot; Reed asks.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Not much, really.&quot; He should probably learn on his own that designing for aesthetics gets you shot down harder than a Russian jet over American airspace. &quot;Mostly just figuring out how to enclose the thing.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; he says. He turns his new computer over to me, showing his model of parts that aren&apos;t put together yet. &quot;I&apos;m not very good at assembling things yet with this new software.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Too familiar with SolidWorks?&quot; I ask.",
      "&emsp;&quot;How did you know?&quot; He asks.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Who isn&apos;t,&quot; I say. &quot;I hate this software. But I&apos;ve been forced to use it for so long I&apos;ve used it ten times as much as all the SolidWorks in undergrad.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re smart for a relatively new guy,&quot; Reed says, laying the compliments on thick like he does with damn near everyone. &quot;We&apos;ll be fast friends,&quot; he says.",
      "&emsp;Sure, I think.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; I say, amicably.",
      "&emsp;&quot;So what did you do over the weekend?&quot;",
      "&emsp;I talk like the other middle-aged men, minus the stuff about the yard I don&apos;t have. &quot;Not much, just went to Costco and went on a run.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;We missed you at the work social,&quot; Reed says. &quot;Is it true you&apos;ve never been to one of them?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I just get tired easy.&quot; And then I whisper, &quot;I get enough home improvement and little-league talk in the stand-up meetings.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Even Kei made it,&quot; Reed says. &quot;She said she tried to call you.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I just wasn&apos;t feeling too great.&quot; I start sketching on the yellow pad to try to look busy enough to get him to leave.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Well I hope I&apos;ll see you next time,&quot; Reed says. He exits to the floor, off to bother some underpaid union technicians with even more stuff they&apos;ll have to assemble. I continue sketching on the notepad, returning the headphones to my ears I bought after I lost Jackson&apos;s iPod Classic.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Quite the eager fella,&quot; Wilbur says.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say. &quot;I guess it hasn&apos;t gotten to him yet.&quot;",
      "&emsp;I see him peek his head from the divider into the narrow alley: a balding Asian man with glasses and light wrinkles. &quot;Has it gotten to you?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I say. The rusted wall fan makes enough noise that only Wilbur can hear my words, so I feel like I&apos;m able to speak openly. &quot;I think I just had a different idea of what engineering was. I liked designing things. But it was when something happened to me &mdash; or to someone in my family, I guess &mdash; that really made me chase it.&quot; I look at the 3D-printed mini model on my desk that I made to show my brother all those years ago. He was amazed by it: so similar to the tech he got to use in the military.",
      "&emsp;&quot;So I&apos;m guessing it wasn&apos;t batteries,&quot; he says, narrowing his eyes in a sagacious smile.",
      "&emsp;&quot;More so flying things. But smaller. And not for people,&quot; I say.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Drones,&quot; he says. And when he answers right, I hand him the little geometric prototype. &quot;This is really cool! When did you make this? And did you make a full-size one?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say. &quot;For Senior Design: after the incident, they let me pretty much be my own sponsor if I could fork the cash.&quot; I feel a rare sense of passion flood my body, and for a moment, I feel almost like Reed. &quot;I led the team to develop it: they let me take on some junior engineers at the school. And you see those gears?&quot; I point at a small pattern in the lines of PLA plastic.",
      "&emsp; &quot;Yeah. Heck &mdash; if this is like 1:10 scale, those must have been really small,&quot; Wilbur says.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Took us damn near a month to find a solution for that. Bevel gears? And that small, with a D-shaft that didn&apos;t fit any existing gears we could order?&quot; My chest runs with the excitement of those days as my tongue spouts off with jargon. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t believe what we had to do to make it work. Last month of a senior project we had a whole year for, and that was the last thing we had to resolve.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Gearbox design is fun,&quot; he muses. &quot;So how did you do it?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Get this: one of the teammates&apos; moms knew another mom that ran a jewelry company. They did lost wax castings&mdash; you know, where they pour in the molten metal to take the shape of the wax?&quot; I pause, realizing I&apos;m talking to a lifer. &quot;No, I&apos;m stupid. Of course you know that.&quot;",
      "&emsp;Wilbur laughs, egging me on.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Anyways, we got this jewelry company to make our gears. Arrived the last week: only a single shot to get them right. And they were perfect: each wrapped in an individually-wrapped vellum bag as if we&apos;d put them on stings and wear them around our neck,&quot; I say, out of breath with excitement, and when I realize the fan has been off for a while, I find Nav and Kei standing at the other end of the cube.",
      "&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s really awesome, Cody,&quot; Naveen says. &quot;Why did you never tell us about that before?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;And you didn&apos;t even tell the best part,&quot; Kei says.",
      "&emsp;My face flushes with humiliation, always uncomfortable when I&apos;m the center of attention. &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I mutter, &quot;which part?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;He won best in show for his year,&quot; Kei said.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Oh, please,&quot; I beg. &quot;I had an uplifting story. And they have a reputation to uphold&mdash;&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;&mdash;And the president of the university took him on a little tour to speak on campus. The press got involved. And he got his story in the Los Angeles Times, can you believe that?&quot; ",
      "&emsp;She points to the article that hangs on the wall of my cubicle:",
      "<span class=CodyHand msgnote>BROTHER OF FALLEN SOLDIER DESIGNS THE FUTURE</span>",
      "&emsp;Beneath the big font on the front page are two pictures: one of Jackson and I when we were kids, and a photo of me directing my team in a suit &mdash; that last hour of the project when we were rushing in full suits and dresses, wearing smocks over our formal clothes, spray-painting the prototype black.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Yeah. It was fun. And that&apos;s why I&apos;m here,&quot; I say. But the high from that memory leaves when reality returns: I freeze my face in the genuine smile I had a minute ago not to lose it, to insist redlines for battery enclosures shouldn&apos;t be any different.",
      "&emsp;&quot;I sure was proud of my boy,&quot; a voice says.",
      "&emsp;I realize it&apos;s lunchtime. ",
      "&emsp;My father Alan, a technician, steps between Kei and Nav.",
      "&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right. You told us a little about Cody before the interview,&quot; Nav says.",
      "&emsp;Dad scratches his salt-and-pepper beard. &quot;Yeah. He used to build things with me in the garage. Now he just designs things on that computer, thinking that&apos;s the real world and all!&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Alright, that&apos;s enough, Dad,&quot; I say.",
      "&emsp;&quot;You didn&apos;t even finish my redline. The one with your name on the drawing? Those two damn 5/16-18 hex screws that are so close they can&apos;t fit a ratchet on them? I put a toolbox together for you.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Alright,&quot; I repeat, grabbing my keys.",
      "&emsp;&quot;&mdash;Not that Harbor Freight shit. I&apos;m talking Snap-On, Gear Wrench, and you must not even touch that stuff if you&apos;re that blind to it!&quot;",
      "&emsp;The three engineers laugh as I rush to push my greasy father out the door."
    ],
    [
      "&emsp;We&apos;re snaking down the switchbacks of Shaleborough Canyon when he decides to take another dig at me.",
      "&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen your car this clean.&quot; He drags one of his dirty fingers across the dashboard.",
      "&emsp;&quot;It&apos;ll only get dirtier if you get your greasy paws all over it,&quot; I tell him.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Did a girl finally make it into your life? Sweet Jesus, I thought you&apos;d be stuck in that game room of yours playing the Nintendo forever,&quot; he says.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Maybe I did,&quot; I say. &quot;Or maybe some girl in my complex wanted to use me for my Costco card.&quot;",
      "&emsp;He sniffs and does a dad cough before offering some fatherly wisdom. &quot;You see, son, women are like raccoons. They&apos;ll tear through all the trash you have to offer until you give them something shiny that keeps their interest.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;So Mom is a raccoon,&quot; I say, expecting him to relent.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Well, your mother had the deepest bags under her eyes when she was teaching in the Los Angeles school district. If a woman can handle a gaggle of rats that try to kill her every day, then you know she&apos;s tough enough to handle someone like me,&quot; he says.",
      "&emsp;He rambles on about living life at my age in the poor part of Los Angeles, and after a couple more turns, we pull into the only lot that gives us enough time to get him back on union time. He says some choice words about the people around him. Then the gossip from the floor, saying how the men he works with whine more than &quot;any of those housewife shows the stay-at-home moms watch.&quot; And by the time we walk in the door of the Wendy&apos;s, he&apos;s silent enough for us to order and sit in one of the plastic booths, wetting his hands with a bottle of Purell before wiping the sullied table with his dirtier work shirt.",
      "&emsp;I glance at the play structure from the nineties that I used to play in, when my father drove down the canyon to meet the rest of our family, spending no longer than the time we have now to check in with us. He worked two shifts for the overtime, to give my brother and I enough to flourish with a full childhood, and when he catches me lost in that memory, he gestures to one of the structure&apos;s cross-bars zip-tied to a pool noodle.",
      "&emsp;&quot;You almost broke your nose on that damn thing,&quot; my father says. &quot;You remember?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Oh, I remember,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Chasing Jackson down the slide. He ducked and I didn&apos;t see it, then I spouted so much damn blood&mdash;&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Like a fountain. And your mother was so panicked,&quot; he laughs, &quot;tearing a whole stack of napkins one-by-one out of the dispenser, while I was smart enough to ask the front for a whole roll of paper towels!&quot;",
      "&emsp;I chuckle. &quot;Those were times.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Good times?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Good enough to remember,&quot; I tell him, just as the tray arrives with our dollar-menu burgers.",
      "&emsp;He picks the pickles out of one of his, then takes a deep bite before rubbing his mouth with a napkin. I bite into mine just as he opens his mouth to speak, halfway through a mouthful. &quot;You know I meant what I said back there.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;About the redlines.&quot; I dip my fries in ketchup.",
      "&emsp;&quot;No, doofus,&quot; he says, staring at me with piercing eyes like mine. &quot;About the project.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;The drone,&quot; I say.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot; He takes another bite, and hunger blocks his next thought for another thirty seconds or so. &quot;You made me so proud that day. I hope you still have that project.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I do,&quot; I say.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Have you worked any further on it since you moved out? You have the tools now,&quot; he says. &quot;And now you know enough to really finish it.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not sure it would even fly anymore,&quot; I tell him.",
      "&emsp;He shakes a fry at me.",
      "&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s a shame.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I just had a lot of energy I had to put somewhere in a really short period of time. After the service at Fort Dietz. After I read that last letter, I had burning purpose, you know? If I didn&apos;t stop, I think that truth would break me entirely.&quot; I sink my teeth into the burger again, distracting myself enough with something savory to prevent the habit of those feelings from coming back.",
      "&emsp;&quot;We each had our own ways of dealing with it,&quot; my father says. &quot;You either channel that empty feeling or it snags you. Catching up in every little moment of those habits he shaped in us.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say. ",
      "&emsp;We closed his bedroom door for months, petrified the exact way he left it. And we were too afraid to open it, just saving that last experience of throwing open the door like the last voicemails on our phones.",
      "&emsp;Because once the door was opened, he&apos;d remain nothing more than a memory, forever.",
      "&emsp;&quot;You reminded me a little of him today,&quot; he says.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Oh yeah?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Well, you&apos;re the age he was now. Your voices sound alike. And when I was done with that soyboy man-bun kid, ragging me over with questions about some stupid enclosure design&mdash;&quot;",
      "&emsp;I laugh. &quot;You mean Reed?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Yeah, whatever. But anyways, when I came up the metal stairs to the room with all the office pukes, I almost thought I heard your brother.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Huh.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I just never hear you passionate like that, son,&quot; he says.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Redlines are shit.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;But you&apos;re not like any of them. Maybe besides that legacy hire friend of yours.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;You really think?&quot; I pull down my eyelid after wiping the salt from my fingers, rolling my right eye into the back of my skull. &quot;Can you see it? Is there a soul still in there?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Cody, I mean it,&quot; he insists. &quot;I&apos;ve been working here for a long time, and I&apos;ve come to understand there&apos;s two types of engineers.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s the ones that do it for the money. The lifers: satisfied with slow work that never changes, with such tribal knowledge that they&apos;d take the whole company down with them if they died.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;That sounds like me without the experience,&quot; I say. ",
      "&emsp;&quot;But you&apos;re not,&quot; Dad says, shaking another fry at me. &quot;You have passion! You&apos;re going to design rockets one day. You&apos;re the dreaming type that wants more.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;All I dream of is not fucking up,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Type two in theory, type one in practice. And I feel like I&apos;m barely surviving the cuts.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Cuts or not, I just don&apos;t want you to lose that part of you that makes you special,&quot; he says. &quot;My sons both have &hellip; had the same spark that I had. The knack. And I want you to live by it the rest of your life.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m working on it. With the job you have, you should know nothing&apos;s ideal more than anyone,&quot; I say.",
      "&emsp;We grab the trays, tilting them into the trash as we sip from a second refill. Having exhausted two weeks&apos; worth of real conversation at a man level, he rambles further about floor gossip all the way back, telling me to &quot;finish his damn redlines&quot; as he opens the shop door for me to get back to work."
    ],
    [
      "&emsp;The rest of the day passes slowly when everybody else is gone: everybody besides Kei and I. The lifers leave early: forced to come in when it&apos;s still dark out so they can take care of their teenagers &mdash; or if they don&apos;t have kids, maybe drink at the bar or something. The young type-A engineers leave a little after so they can make the most of summer&apos;s long evenings, whether it&apos;s running or biking  out on the trails in the open fields between the housing developments, or finding the motivation somewhere to run a load of laundry.",
      "&emsp;Then Nav leaves, and Reed and Kei say goodbye to him. Then Reed tries to talk to Kei, the only one left in the section, who responds with short yes-and-no answers unless he throws a free-response question at her. Then Reed drags a bunch of virtual cards around his computer, playing Solitaire for almost an hour until he can clock out half an hour longer than eight hours. Then he says goodbye to Kei, then it&apos;s absolutely silent for an hour beyond Kei&apos;s mouse clicks, and when 5:00 rolls around, I shoulder my bag and wave goodbye to the workaholic girl I have a crush on, reminding her that there&apos;s still a world out there.",
      "&emsp;But this time, it felt different. And it&apos;s consistently felt a little different. Maybe Dad is right that I&apos;ve changed, because instead of leaving the long dragging hours of boredom to find respite in inaction, there&apos;s a part of me that wonders what&apos;s happening on the other side of the door.",
      "&emsp;But it isn&apos;t much, and ever since I photocopied the rule sheet that Katiya and I wrote up, the first and last rule catch my eye every time I reach to open the door. Maybe it&apos;s just the prospect of that mystical threshold that fills me with excitement. Maybe it&apos;s the images and feelings she&apos;s left me with that I still fight like hell to resist. Or maybe it&apos;s fear of what could happen, overriding the boredom of modern life that comes when you get on the other side of adolescence.",
      "&emsp;The house is silent when I pull in: the garage door groans as its panels screech back in place. Sometimes I imagine finding her sitting there with a bag of my chips in her combat armor, watching Netflix, but she&apos;s been so busy the last week or so, and even though I haven&apos;t found a reason to unlock my side of the door since we last went for that run, I feel the urge to let in a chance for something to happen."
