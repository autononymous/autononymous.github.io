      "<p>&emsp;In the long, dragging years after college, all I could ever ask is to waste my life as efficiently as possible. </p><p>&emsp;My mind loiters in the long lull between emails, dragging the 3D model on my computer in circles. The flat fluorescents take the office closer to a colorless center: what my colleague calls &quot;suicide gray,&quot; showing no sign of winter&apos;s transition to spring. Somewhere beyond the window shades and bleached brick walls, life awakens from its slumber in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, trading the dormant golden brown for verdant green. And though the end of winter is supposed to bring that nostalgic chill, I&apos;m kept lukewarm by the hum of an unbalanced, rusted fan that rattles over any sound of nature.</p><p>&emsp;But I notice one thing, at least. I can smell the dry acreage of cereal grasses scattered across the Rocky Mountain foothills: a sense that only comes when it&apos;s late in the fall, or after the long winter when my nose is no longer running, when the world begins to open. It&apos;s when the late sun absorbs in the fronds of dormant fields once left to shadow &mdash; that golden hour late in the workday &mdash; when an arid essence gusts through the cracked corners of the crumbling ceiling.</p><p>&emsp;Our department&apos;s office is tucked in the brow of several hills that block it from a captivating view. It was home to Navidson-Monroe&apos;s Aerospace division in the sixties, still sharing a wall with the warehouse where technicians toil over our drawings. But the Aerospace team and its bean counters made their great migration in the nineties, taking their perch a couple hundred feet higher atop the foothills: glancing down upon the city of Denver, convinced their fingers feel for the pulse of the throat of the world. </p><p>&emsp;So then the less-sexy divisions &mdash; like us &mdash; fell down into their musty wake, too far behind the &quot;cutting edge&quot; to earn a view beyond the cutting edge. </p><p>&emsp;Working in the battery division of an aerospace company is like eating ice cream every day, but it&apos;s got raisins in it. A fine treat for a new graduate, but I crave something that tastes more like space &mdash; like Dippin&apos; Dots, or maybe those freeze-dried ice creams they sell at the science museum. It&apos;s like ordering a salad at a pizza place, or ordering a cheeseburger at a Mexican restaurant. Or any other food-related simile: I&apos;m just hungry and bored since it&apos;s so close to the end of the day, and I don&apos;t have any frozen meals left in the break room fridge.</p><p>&emsp;But maybe every dream is a Pyrrhic compromise between that first, beatific vision and half of anything you ever bargained for. When I glance out the surly glass window, cocking my head at just the right angle, I can see the same shimmering solar reflectors and satellite dishes I saw from the window of my childhood bedroom. And although the Level 01 insignia on my nametag hasn&apos;t changed in two-and-a-half years, I guess I&apos;m at least physically closer.</p><p>&emsp;One day I&apos;ll design rockets, I promised myself.</p><p>&emsp;My father said that&apos;s what it takes to chase a dream. I believe in that freedom because I don&apos;t have a choice. I&apos;m the last chance my mother and father have to see their child make it, and when I look at the wallpaper of my brother and I on the vertical monitor, I remember I&apos;m the only one who was blessed with time.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I realize I&apos;m done working on the redline when my hands stop moving. Copying changes from a red-inked engineering drawing to the computer is easy enough to get lost in thought. The music from my brother&apos;s old IPod keeps the rhythm in the keys. I pop out one of the yellowed earbuds so the lyrics don&apos;t mince the words.</p><p>&emsp;In the title block: DUNSMORE, 04/24/26.</p><p>&emsp;Checked by SAKURASHIMA, 04/24/26. That means I have an excuse to let my crush Kei look at it.</p><p>&emsp;Designed by PRADESH, the guy who keeps giving me these  sheets with red scribbles on them, telling me exactly the changes to make, leaving no room for creativity or judgment.</p><p>&emsp;Control-P. Landscape. Tabloid. Margins wide, and black-and-white lines, so the the sheet looks bleaker than the office. </p><p>&emsp;My computer talks to the printer, sounding off a distant whir six rows down. I rise from the cubicle, untucking the collared shirt from my jeans, opposite of what I used to do when I started here. Seems most of my fellow pencil-pushers have settled on the fact that we&apos;re not flashy enough to get customer visits. That&apos;s for the suit-wearing showmen of the R&D division, off in their hangar.</p><p>&emsp;The paper is warm when it spins two sheets off the press &mdash; one copy of my drawing, and one copy of the reference drawing I used from the fifties. The office is so quiet that I can hear it tap against the edge of the tray. It&apos;s time for an appraisal on my work, a second set of eyes, and I return to the only other engineer near my age in this division. She&apos;s poised at her standing desk when I approach her, focused on a model of a battery enclosure.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey there, Kei,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;She lifts a finger. I rest my elbow against the divide of her cubicle. She refuses eye contact, glued to some calculation as her lips move without words. Then she says: &quot;Remember seven and nine-sixteenths.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh . . . got it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She takes a long pause, her manicured nails clattering against the pink, wireless keyboard. Then she draws several  lines on the pad of engineering paper, scribbling several numbers down, halting at the fifth.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay, what was it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Six,&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Six . . .&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And . . . twenty-five sixteenths?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Twenty-five . . .&quot; She finally looks up at me with her sapphire rings though dark bangs. &quot;What&apos;s your problem?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Lots of things. Nothing work-related,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I doubt that,&quot; she says, but cracks a smile as she takes the pages into her hands.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do you have your Ouija board?&quot; I ask. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;For what?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The person who made this would be a hundred and twenty,&quot; I say. &quot;Since we couldn&apos;t call them during retirement, I thought I&apos;d try the afterlife.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;It gets half a laugh. &quot;I thought seances were for the sales team, always trying to predict our next contract.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re able to sell things before we even design them,&quot; I say. &quot;How do they do it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I wish I knew. Maybe we could get ahead for once, then.&quot; Her eyes return to the page. &quot;So what&apos;d you screw up this time?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I describe the process.</p><p>&emsp; &quot;You know, I thought Student Government in high school was the end of you asking seniors for help,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d ask one of our lifers if I wanted a senior&apos;s ideas. I figured you&apos;d spare me an oral history of hand-drafting.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure.&quot; She gestures to the far corner of her desk, stacked neatly with folded sheets. &quot;I&apos;ll get to it later today if you add it to the pile.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Later today?&quot; I ask. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s Friday,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not like I have anything else interesting going on,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;re staying late again?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Her oscillating fan wafts her perfume into the air. I&apos;m assaulted with the mental rhyme of a different late Friday, one evening when it was just the two of us, the last Friday of the year before she left for college. </p><p>&emsp;A memory flashes of the club room in high school half a decade ago. It was the night before the summer festival. She was sitting at the desk facing the open window. The wind caught her hair as she stapled strips of construction paper into long chains. I feel my stomach well with the same feeling I felt then, when I realized I was running out of time to make a move, before a whole year would separate us. I remember that stirring feeling of excitement when I approached her, longing for the courage to speak the words.</p><p>&emsp;But she acted first. </p><p>&emsp;The darkness of that room made it feel like the two of us spent an eternity in there, as if she was making up for the whole year I wouldn&apos;t see her, for the unrequited connection that began just a little too late. We laid there on the reading couch, facing each other, feeling each other, letting passion pass the hours before the scuttle of the midnight cleaning crew returned us to reality. And then&mdash;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hello &mdash; Earth to Cody?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I realize I&apos;m watching her lips move instead of listening to her words. &quot;Uh . . . yeah? What?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about the other three things I sent you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Three things? Oh. The redlines, you mean.&quot; I scratch the back of my head. &quot;Still in the works. I&apos;m almost done with the second one.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s been like two weeks.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Naveen Pradesh peeks above the wall of his cubicle, and I know exactly what&apos;s in store.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know. But with the enclosure redesign, I just&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Nav asks, &quot;How many did you finish today, Cody?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I did two of them,&quot; I say. &quot;Sir.&quot; My voice cracks. &quot;But I had to scan the old drawings through the projector, on the old computer, and...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Our team is behind. We need all hands on deck here, or else we&apos;re never going to beat all the stuff the machine shop is sending us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know that,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;ll&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You need to get in early. And you need to stay the full time. Like Kei: sometimes even longer than eight hours. Just because you&apos;re salaried doesn&apos;t mean every day can be a half-day.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I nod. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;You want to be on her level, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I stumble over the response as that familiar pang of anxiety arrests me. My nails bite the flesh of my palms.</p><p>&emsp; &quot;Y-yeah,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;I feel that poisonous feeling rise in my stomach, the same one I felt all those times before, every time my ambition was axed with sharp critique. The words that follow are well-rehearsed.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I promise I&apos;ll do better.&quot; I turn to Kei before retreating to my desk. &quot;And thanks. I&apos;ll have all your stuff done by the end of Monday.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;End of today, Cody,&quot; Nav says.</p><p>&emsp;It takes everything not to give in.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure, boss,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;m on it.&quot;</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I retreat to my desk to doom-scroll through social media, trading the personal feeling of apathy for a more global feeling of hopelessness. It fills me with a certain kind of despair when I see all the marriage announcements of friends and acquaintances, like I&apos;ve continuously been behind since I never dated in college: not even Kei. I had some fun, but I was too busy for anything meaningful. And as the only child left in my family, my parents beg for grandchildren like I used to beg for sleepovers on the weekends. My profile says I&apos;m single, and it hasn&apos;t changed since the end of high school when a different childhood friend and I tried to hit it off. But like Kei and I the year before, it was just too late.</p><p>&emsp;I can&apos;t help but keep scrolling to pass the time. It does little to release the burnout of five continuous hours.  If it&apos;s not social media, it&apos;s something else: endless politics; global warming; celebrity nonsense; social turmoil. And eventually &mdash; as I always do &mdash; I close the app just to open it again.</p><p>&emsp;The last sliver of the workday passes. I manage to grind out the third redline a couple minutes before 4:40. I used to get in so early to be ahead of all the others, but now I get in a little after 9:00 and work until everyone else has left, jog my mouse for a while, then either change into gym clothes or head straight home. </p><p>&emsp;Naveen surprises me before I can pack my bag. He approaches with his backpack over his shoulder, ready to start his weekend. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody. Make sure you get in early on Monday &mdash; I know you tend to get in rather late.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, yeah. Sure thing, Nav,&quot; I tell him, stuffing down the aftertaste of our exchange. &quot;Is there something before the stand-up meeting? It&apos;s not on the calendar.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The rest of the team talked about it last night at our Thursday get-together. I was about to leave right now until I realized you weren&apos;t there to hear it.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;His expression is distraught. The pang of fear seizes my stomach again. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What is it?&quot; I manage.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s a meeting on Monday, nine A.M., about the new contract,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We have that in the bag, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. It&apos;s not looking good.&quot;    </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not good? What does that mean? As in less work? Or...&quot; My stomach turns further with the call of the void. If it&apos;s really that, and the grim reaper in HR is sharpening her scythe, I&apos;d think the surprise meeting would have happened today, giving us a weekend to mourn our benefits.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not sure yet. But I promise you guys will hear anything they tell me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I swallow. If there&apos;s one good thing I can say about him, it&apos;s that he&apos;s always transparent.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. Thanks, boss.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, shifting the weight of his Jansport backpack, still hanging there as if he&apos;s trying to remember something.</p><p>&emsp;I try at humor.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey. If it&apos;s catered, I&apos;ll get there whenever you want me. You know this company runs on grocery store donuts.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sure there will be something.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;He smirks a little. Feels like joking with my doctor at a well-check, or the cashier&apos;s response when the unscanned item should be free. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;There was one more thing,&quot; he says, lingering there. &quot;There was something you told me last week . . .&quot; His words are followed by the silence of the empty cubes and the 3D printer&apos;s persistent whine. He&apos;s trying to remember something, and after a couple seconds of scratching his chin, it finally hits him. &quot;Oh yeah &mdash; you get to move into the new place today, is that right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Congratulations.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks. My parents are helping me unload my stuff. But Mom seems kind of sad, though.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. Took my wife a while to get over it when Raj left,&quot; Nav says. &quot;But he went out of state, though.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. Nice,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Off to California.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s cool,&quot; I add. &quot;Just like I did.&quot;</p><p>&emsp; &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Great,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. For Silicon Valley,&quot; he says. &quot;Computer science.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Wow,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. For some startup. He says he&apos;s enjoying it,&quot; Nav says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sweet,&quot; I add, completely tapped out on adjectives.</p><p>&emsp;He shifts the weight of his backpack, steadying his square-frame glasses. &quot;Well, congrats. It&apos;s a big step. You&apos;ve earned it, my friend,&quot; he says, with a light smile. &quot;Just don&apos;t lift so much this weekend that you sleep in.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yep. Nine A.M. sharp. And free coffee,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp; &quot;Always,&quot; he says, giving the same thumbs-up he does at the end of any day. &quot;Thanks for getting those redlines done.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I nod. Then my computer times out from half an hour of inactivity before I can lock it.</p><p>&emsp;I stare at the reflection, struggling to reconcile what I see. A silhouette of overgrown, short brown hair glares back at me, his stubble long past five-o&apos;clock, roughly combed into a corporate shape. His expression is sunken like melted wax, crescents etched beneath his sockets, and melting further every day. </p><p>&emsp;Below the monitor, a hefty pile of work is bottomless. I can&apos;t bring myself to touch the rest of it today, so instead I hide my head in my hands, trying not to wet my palms with my eyes. A couple minutes pass after the electronic door clicks behind Nav, and another row away, the gentle sound of keystrokes cease their clatter.</p><p>&emsp;My screen lights with something in the lower-right corner.</p><p><span class=msgfromdate>SAKURA_KEI 16:57:12:</span></p><p><span class=msgfrom>Got a minute?</span></p><p>&emsp;I fumble the login twice before I send the reply.</p><p><span class=msgtodate>DUNSMO_COD 16:58:21:</span></p><p><span class=msgto>&#128077; </span></p><p>&emsp; I can hear her heels in the linoleum crossway before she reaches the flourescent-bleached carpet, and I&apos;m quick to wipe my eyes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey, Cody. I&apos;m sorry I caused all that. I know Nav can be pretty direct about things,&quot; Kei says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, it&apos;s fine. He&apos;s right, and it doesn&apos;t bother me . . . but,&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;But what?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;I perk my ears to the rest of the office, to ensure we&apos;re the only ones left. It still comes out as a raucous whisper.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But I&apos;m just so tired, you know?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;The sadness crystallizes to anger, and I pull a restrained splinter of it out of me. &quot;So when do I get to design something? Where&apos;s the industry life that University sold to me? All those senior projects that let us play pretend, tossing us three hundred bucks a team to think up inventions that might change the world. It&apos;s no wonder that none of our professors tried living in the real world.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She nods. &quot;No kidding.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I thought every day in industry would be fun. Hell, I was like one of those graduating preschoolers, you know, saying he wants to be a cop so he can &apos;shoot bad guys&apos; . . . or whatever it is that Paw Patrol tells your little brothers the criminal justice system is about.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She laughs hard enough to snort. It&apos;s too late to cover her mouth. &quot;They&apos;re in middle school now, so I don&apos;t think they watch that stuff anymore. They&apos;re into anime now.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But all we get to do is fix mistakes. Everything that exists in this company has already been designed, and we&apos;re just left with the paperwork.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I thought you loved paperwork,&quot; Kei says. &quot;You were so good at it during our campaign in Student Gov.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because you made me do it. That&apos;s all a Vice President is good for.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please, Cody. You were good at more than that,&quot; she says. </p><p>&emsp;My heart almost skips a beat. But she&apos;s talking about the work.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Tell me,&quot; I ask. &quot;How long have you been here?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She counts the seasons on her fingers. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;About three years. Roughly one more than you&apos;ve been here &mdash; because I got out of college a quarter early.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And when did you move up?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She seems reluctant, as if it will hurt me. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please, just tell me,&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;After . . . a year and two months, but we were busy, you know, and projects kept flowing. They could afford it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I turn away from the monitor. My eyes settle on the shadow cast by the Space Division building. &quot;I&apos;ll get there. And to the next thing, I know. It&apos;s just going to be a while.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re a good worker. And you&apos;re doing fine,&quot; she says. I can feel her hand on my shoulder, sending sparks through my nerves. &quot;There&apos;s a reason I picked you to run with me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So it wasn&apos;t just looks,&quot; I say. &quot;Or my cultural background. I know I tested well with the Lacrosse Bro demographic.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You were one of them. But, no, that&apos;s not why.&quot; She shares a genuine smile. &quot;You should know you&apos;re more than any of that,&quot; she says, looking at me the same way she used to &mdash; but I know better now than to read any further. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You should go home. You&apos;ve been working on that last redline for three days, and now it&apos;s over. Call it a week.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s only four-thirty,&quot; I say. &quot;How long have you been here?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Since six or so.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you&apos;re a better woman than I am.&quot; Then I add, &quot;Since I&apos;m not.&quot; Then I add, &quot;A woman, you know.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Enough,&quot; she laughs. &quot;Go set up your new place. And you know . . . I&apos;d love to stop by and check it out sometime.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My heart skips. &quot;Sure,&quot; I say. &quot;And . . .&quot; maybe we could stop by after a movie this weekend?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And what?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And . . . I&apos;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ll see me Monday,&quot; she says. &quot;Don&apos;t come in tomorrow. Even I won&apos;t be here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I thought you slept here,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not on the weekends. Just set your alarm on Sunday: you can&apos;t be late again.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She returns to her row. I gather my things, throwing my bag over my shoulder to go home and recover from this exhausting brand of restlessness. </p><p>&emsp;I pass her row of cubes lit by a single light from her pink lamp. She&apos;s comfortably buried in the stacks of drawings, and I find a part of me wondering how I ever found the strength to carry that weight.</p>"

        "<p id=\"1.2.2.4\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Designed by PRADESH, the guy who keeps giving me these  sheets with red scribbles on them, telling me exactly the changes to make, leaving no room for creativity or judgment.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.5\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Control-P. Landscape. Tabloid. Margins wide, and black-and-white lines, so the the sheet looks bleaker than the office. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.6\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My computer talks to the printer, sounding off a distant whir six rows down. I rise from the cubicle, untucking the collared shirt from my jeans, opposite of what I used to do when I started here. Seems most of my fellow pencil-pushers have settled on the fact that we&apos;re not flashy enough to get customer visits. That&apos;s for the suit-wearing showmen of the R&D division, off in their hangar.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.7\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The paper is warm when it spins two sheets off the press &mdash; one copy of my drawing, and one copy of the reference drawing I used from the fifties. The office is so quiet that I can hear it tap against the edge of the tray. It&apos;s time for an appraisal on my work, a second set of eyes, and I return to the only other engineer near my age in this division. She&apos;s poised at her standing desk when I approach her, focused on a model of a battery enclosure.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.8\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Hey there, Kei,&quot; I say. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.9\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She lifts a finger. I rest my elbow against the divide of her cubicle. She refuses eye contact, glued to some calculation as her lips move without words. Then she says: &quot;Remember seven and nine-sixteenths.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.10\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Uh . . . got it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.11\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She takes a long pause, her manicured nails clattering against the pink, wireless keyboard. Then she draws several  lines on the pad of engineering paper, scribbling several numbers down, halting at the fifth.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Okay, what was it?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Six,&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.2.2.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;And . . . twenty-five sixteenths?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Twenty-five . . .&quot; She finally looks up at me with her sapphire rings though dark bangs. &quot;What&apos;s your problem?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Lots of things. Nothing work-related,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I doubt that,&quot; she says, but cracks a smile as she takes the pages into her hands.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Do you have your Ouija board?&quot; I ask. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;For what?&quot; She asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;The person who made this would be a hundred and twenty,&quot; I say. &quot;Since we couldn&apos;t call them during retirement, I thought I&apos;d try the afterlife.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;It gets half a laugh. &quot;I thought seances were for the sales team, always trying to predict our next contract.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.23\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re able to sell things before we even design them,&quot; I say. &quot;How do they do it?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I wish I knew. Maybe we could get ahead for once, then.&quot; Her eyes return to the page. &quot;So what&apos;d you screw up this time?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I describe the process.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp; &quot;You know, I thought Student Government in high school was the end of you asking seniors for help,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d ask one of our lifers if I wanted a senior&apos;s ideas. I figured you&apos;d spare me an oral history of hand-drafting.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Sure.&quot; She gestures to the far corner of her desk, stacked neatly with folded sheets. &quot;I&apos;ll get to it later today if you add it to the pile.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Later today?&quot; I ask. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s Friday,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not like I have anything else interesting going on,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;re staying late again?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.34\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Her oscillating fan wafts her perfume into the air. I&apos;m assaulted with the mental rhyme of a different late Friday, one evening when it was just the two of us, the last Friday of the year before she left for college. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.35\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;A memory flashes of the club room in high school half a decade ago. It was the night before the summer festival. She was sitting at the desk facing the open window. The wind caught her hair as she stapled strips of construction paper into long chains. I feel my stomach well with the same feeling I felt then, when I realized I was running out of time to make a move, before a whole year would separate us. I remember that stirring feeling of excitement when I approached her, longing for the courage to speak the words.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.36\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But she acted first. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.37\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The darkness of that room made it feel like the two of us spent an eternity in there, as if she was making up for the whole year I wouldn&apos;t see her, for the unrequited connection that began just a little too late. We laid there on the reading couch, facing each other, feeling each other, letting passion pass the hours before the scuttle of the midnight cleaning crew returned us to reality. And then&mdash;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.38\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Hello &mdash; Earth to Cody?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.39\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I realize I&apos;m watching her lips move instead of listening to her words. &quot;Uh . . . yeah? What?&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.40\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;How about the other three things I sent you?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.41\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Three things? Oh. The redlines, you mean.&quot; I scratch the back of my head. &quot;Still in the works. I&apos;m almost done with the second one.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.42\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s been like two weeks.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.43\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Naveen Pradesh peeks above the wall of his cubicle, and I know exactly what&apos;s in store.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.44\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I know. But with the enclosure redesign, I just&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.45\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Nav asks, &quot;How many did you finish today, Cody?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.46\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I did two of them,&quot; I say. &quot;Sir.&quot; My voice cracks. &quot;But I had to scan the old drawings through the projector, on the old computer, and...&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.47\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Our team is behind. We need all hands on deck here, or else we&apos;re never going to beat all the stuff the machine shop is sending us.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.48\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I know that,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;ll&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.49\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You need to get in early. And you need to stay the full time. Like Kei: sometimes even longer than eight hours. Just because you&apos;re salaried doesn&apos;t mean every day can be a half-day.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.50\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I nod. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.51\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You want to be on her level, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.52\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I stumble over the response as that familiar pang of anxiety arrests me. My nails bite the flesh of my palms.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.53\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp; &quot;Y-yeah,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.54\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I feel that poisonous feeling rise in my stomach, the same one I felt all those times before, every time my ambition was axed with sharp critique. The words that follow are well-rehearsed.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.55\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I promise I&apos;ll do better.&quot; I turn to Kei before retreating to my desk. &quot;And thanks. I&apos;ll have all your stuff done by the end of Monday.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.56\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;End of today, Cody,&quot; Nav says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.2.57\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;It takes everything not to give in.</p>",

      [
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.1\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I retreat to my desk to doom-scroll through social media, trading the personal feeling of apathy for a more global feeling of hopelessness. It fills me with a certain kind of despair when I see all the marriage announcements of friends and acquaintances, like I&apos;ve continuously been behind since I never dated in college: not even Kei. I had some fun, but I was too busy for anything meaningful. And as the only child left in my family, my parents beg for grandchildren like I used to beg for sleepovers on the weekends. My profile says I&apos;m single, and it hasn&apos;t changed since the end of high school when a different childhood friend and I tried to hit it off. But like Kei and I the year before, it was just too late.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.2\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I can&apos;t help but keep scrolling to pass the time. It does little to release the burnout of five continuous hours.  If it&apos;s not social media, it&apos;s something else: endless politics; global warming; celebrity nonsense; social turmoil. And eventually &mdash; as I always do &mdash; I close the app just to open it again.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.3\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The last sliver of the workday passes. I manage to grind out the third redline a couple minutes before 4:40. I used to get in so early to be ahead of all the others, but now I get in a little after 9:00 and work until everyone else has left, jog my mouse for a while, then either change into gym clothes or head straight home. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.4\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Naveen surprises me before I can pack my bag. He approaches with his backpack over his shoulder, ready to start his weekend. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.5\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Cody. Make sure you get in early on Monday &mdash; I know you tend to get in rather late.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.6\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh, yeah. Sure thing, Nav,&quot; I tell him, stuffing down the aftertaste of our exchange. &quot;Is there something before the stand-up meeting? It&apos;s not on the calendar.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.7\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;The rest of the team talked about it last night at our Thursday get-together. I was about to leave right now until I realized you weren&apos;t there to hear it.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.8\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;His expression is distraught. The pang of fear seizes my stomach again. </p>",

        "<p id=\"1.2.3.10\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s a meeting on Monday, nine A.M., about the new contract,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.11\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;We have that in the bag, right?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No. It&apos;s not looking good.&quot;    </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Not good? What does that mean? As in less work? Or...&quot; My stomach turns further with the call of the void. If it&apos;s really that, and the grim reaper in HR is sharpening her scythe, I&apos;d think the surprise meeting would have happened today, giving us a weekend to mourn our benefits.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not sure yet. But I promise you guys will hear anything they tell me.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I swallow. If there&apos;s one good thing I can say about him, it&apos;s that he&apos;s always transparent.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Sure. Thanks, boss.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, shifting the weight of his Jansport backpack, still hanging there as if he&apos;s trying to remember something.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I try at humor.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Hey. If it&apos;s catered, I&apos;ll get there whenever you want me. You know this company runs on grocery store donuts.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sure there will be something.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He smirks a little. Feels like joking with my doctor at a well-check, or the cashier&apos;s response when the unscanned item should be free. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;There was one more thing,&quot; he says, lingering there. &quot;There was something you told me last week . . .&quot; His words are followed by the silence of the empty cubes and the 3D printer&apos;s persistent whine. He&apos;s trying to remember something, and after a couple seconds of scratching his chin, it finally hits him. &quot;Oh yeah &mdash; you get to move into the new place today, is that right?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.23\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; I say. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Congratulations.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Thanks. My parents are helping me unload my stuff. But Mom seems kind of sad, though.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Sure. Took my wife a while to get over it when Raj left,&quot; Nav says. &quot;But he went out of state, though.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh. Nice,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Off to California.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s cool,&quot; I add. &quot;Just like I did.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp; &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Great,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah. For Silicon Valley,&quot; he says. &quot;Computer science.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Wow,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.34\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah. For some startup. He says he&apos;s enjoying it,&quot; Nav says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.35\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Sweet,&quot; I add, completely tapped out on adjectives.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.36\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He shifts the weight of his backpack, steadying his square-frame glasses. &quot;Well, congrats. It&apos;s a big step. You&apos;ve earned it, my friend,&quot; he says, with a light smile. &quot;Just don&apos;t lift so much this weekend that you sleep in.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.37\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yep. Nine A.M. sharp. And free coffee,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.38\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp; &quot;Always,&quot; he says, giving the same thumbs-up he does at the end of any day. &quot;Thanks for getting those redlines done.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.39\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I nod. Then my computer times out from half an hour of inactivity before I can lock it.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.40\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I stare at the reflection, struggling to reconcile what I see. A silhouette of overgrown, short brown hair glares back at me, his stubble long past five-o&apos;clock, roughly combed into a corporate shape. His expression is sunken like melted wax, crescents etched beneath his sockets, and melting further every day. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.41\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Below the monitor, a hefty pile of work is bottomless. I can&apos;t bring myself to touch the rest of it today, so instead I hide my head in my hands, trying not to wet my palms with my eyes. A couple minutes pass after the electronic door clicks behind Nav, and another row away, the gentle sound of keystrokes cease their clatter.</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.2.3.50\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No, it&apos;s fine. He&apos;s right, and it doesn&apos;t bother me . . . but,&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.51\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But what?&quot; She asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.52\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I perk my ears to the rest of the office, to ensure we&apos;re the only ones left. It still comes out as a raucous whisper.</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.2.3.54\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.55\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The sadness crystallizes to anger, and I pull a restrained splinter of it out of me. &quot;So when do I get to design something? Where&apos;s the industry life that University sold to me? All those senior projects that let us play pretend, tossing us three hundred bucks a team to think up inventions that might change the world. It&apos;s no wonder that none of our professors tried living in the real world.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.56\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She nods. &quot;No kidding.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.57\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I thought every day in industry would be fun. Hell, I was like one of those graduating preschoolers, you know, saying he wants to be a cop so he can &apos;shoot bad guys&apos; . . . or whatever it is that Paw Patrol tells your little brothers the criminal justice system is about.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.58\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She laughs hard enough to snort. It&apos;s too late to cover her mouth. &quot;They&apos;re in middle school now, so I don&apos;t think they watch that stuff anymore. They&apos;re into anime now.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.2.3.59\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But all we get to do is fix mistakes. Everything that exists in this company has already been designed, and we&apos;re just left with the paperwork.&quot; </p>",

      "<p>&emsp;I hoped this week would never come. </p><p>&emsp;Six months have passed since we arrived here. We were taken straight from graduation, the first time they hitched wagons to motorcars instead of horses.</p><p>&emsp;It was as soon as we dropped our bags in the barracks that the Royal Guardsmen kept us busy in every waking moment, spending every second of daylight training in the militarized city of Gaffesend. And every night, I found myself at the taverns (though I never touched so much as a drop of ale), dragging my boyfriend Jullian out of the barracks until light crested over the horizon; refusing to be alone; begging to forget the impermanence of this small breadth of freedom.</p><p>&emsp;Yet that freedom ends today. </p><p>&emsp;I find myself here in Gaffesend Tavern, sitting at a bartop, watching the bustling narrow street in front of the grand lake, wondering why Jullian hasn&apos;t bothered to approach me. I hate drinking because it always makes me feel like I&apos;m too weak to face reality. Before long, I realize I&apos;m not watching the exits &mdash; and the more I keep pace with my male comrades, the more I find some stupid hope that this dizziness might shake my own feelings loose. I swirl the crimson ale around in the wooden mug to free the bubbles, envying how easily they float to the surface. </p><p>&emsp;An hour passes since the close of labour. The cobblestone streets bustle with villagers returning home from a long day&apos;s work. There are four of us that watch from the window, entranced by the balance of energy between two worlds. Now is that rare hour when the drunken stupor of the pub&apos;s regulars matches the stumble of the tiresome commoners. The sun has already vanished below the mountains, but its colorful influence reflects across the lake.</p><p>&emsp;I get the spins as my childhood friend Bertram talks to Ryder and Cae, two shy recruits that would sit alone if we weren&apos;t all friends. None of us would be here if they weren&apos;t dangling the keys to our new homes at the end of it, forcing us all to weather the best and worst of our graduating class. Somewhere behind us, the others laugh and cheer. They&apos;ve convinced themselves that this transition is a triumphant victory, too shortsighted to see that life in Gaffesend rides on the results of an enervating final test. </p><p>&emsp;There&apos;s no more simulations, practice runs, or drills. Failure is a one-way ticket to the front lines, and I will never get another chance.</p><p>&emsp;I take another sip, coaxing that feeling of joy to wash over me. I can tell that Bertram thinks the same thoughts when his eyes rest on the village on the other side of the lake. He nudges my right arm before opening his mouth to speak, gesturing to the twelve other trainees behind him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;To them it&apos;s just a random assignment, no more than the toss of a coin. But to you and I, and maybe Ryder, this is divine. This is the will of the Gods, Katiya. This is the first sentence in our declaration of war.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I tell him it is, and with my next swallow of ale, I prove it.</p><p>&emsp;The details are hazy. My mind protects me by forgetting everything I witnessed as a young child, and the harder I push to excise them, the deeper they dig. All I have left is the memory of Bertram pulling me from the smoldering cabin, dragging me to my mother Stella so that our fractured families could escape to the south.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;For years I was so angry,&quot; I tell him. &quot;If I could have joined the forces then, I would have put off all the schooling. I would have gone straight to the front lines to find justice for what they did to us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So why didn&apos;t you?&quot; He asks with a smirk.</p><p>&emsp;I shrug. &quot;How could all Chymaerans be evil if there are people like Pax that have their blood?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I gesture to the half-blooded halfwit behind us. Paxton uses his Chymaeran Essence to try to freeze the watered-down liquor, enough to stack a seventh shot glass as the others cheer him on, drawing the attention of all the other patrons. Even Ryder puts his book down for a second to watch, letting out a small chuckle as it wavers.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You have honor and a kind heart, and it&apos;s what I like about you. What I always have,&quot; Bertram says. He leans close enough that I can feel his firm shoulder press against mine. &quot;But keep enough of that anger. If we don&apos;t make the program &mdash; or if the enemy breaks the lines and crosses the lake in the winter &mdash; that fury is the only thing that&apos;s going to keep us alive.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Rest assured it runs in my circuits with the Essence,&quot; I tell him. &quot;The long winter ends with our probation. It&apos;s spring now, and we have a&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My words cut short when the tower crashes on the eighth glass. Pax presses his face to the table&apos;s surface, sucking up whatever he can of the liquor and the attention. </p><p>&emsp;But I still find that I&apos;m unable to escape the gravity of that feeling &mdash; that dragging desire that&apos;s followed me since the beginning. The desire to have that one moment that validates all of it, that makes it all worth something. And I pray to the Gods that longing is stronger than the fear of what lies ahead. </p>",
      "<p>&emsp;It all starts when Chief Aldrin climbs the small stage. Tonight it&apos;s edicts instead of music, and he takes a swig from his mug to make sure the words sound like a toast instead of orders.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It was three months ago that you all graduated in the top of your class. Instead of heading straight to the front lines, you were chosen to challenge yourself with a higher purpose. You demonstrated that you might have what it takes to join our ranks full-time. And starting tomorrow, you&apos;ll get your chance to prove yourself as something special.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Aldrin Valensend pauses expecting cheers, but he&apos;s met with silence. The cadets&apos; faces fall when reality crashes their party.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Or else it&apos;s off to the meat grinder,&quot; Ryder mutters, closing his book on an earmarked page. &quot;The machine is hungry again.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;So hungry they&apos;d let in women like me, I think. To wear the men&apos;s leftovers.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;S-so hungry they&apos;d let in outsiders like me, I guess.&quot; Cae&apos;s ears twitch as she mutters into her cup. The Ahkvan swishes her tail with apprehension, and when Aldrin opens his mouth to try to rally us again, she withdraws her face from the mug, saturating the bronze fur on her face with a fine mustache of suds.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Look. I can tell you&apos;re all nervous,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s why I have the kegs here, to try to loosen you up a little,&quot; he says, taking another swig as if it will get him one sip closer to connecting with us. &quot;Trust me, lads. There&apos;s fear in every class &mdash; I&apos;ve seen fifteen in my time, and the reaction is the same every night before. But I want you to understand that you are not fighting for a limited number of slots. There is not a set number: you have already proved your excellence in the Capital. And if you keep that excellence, you will join us. I mean, Katiya&apos;s brother Erik joined us last year.&quot; He turns to me for validation. &quot;Didn&apos;t Erik say it wasn&apos;t that bad?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I say, &quot;It wasn&apos;t bad for his health, at least. Without all the drinking, he dropped a near twenty pounds.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The cadets chuckle, and Aldrin looks a little more self-assured.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I can assure you that the last three months is a hard as this probation gets.&quot; He holds up a stamped sheet of vellum scrawled with ink. &quot;You see this page?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We all recongize it immmediately. It was taken straight from the posting board outside the field office.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This system hearkens back to the old days. Back to those centuries ago when the world was vastly unexplored: those centuries when bands of brave adventurers took tasks to be paid in Kine, back when the empire&apos;s reach was shorter. When ruins and old dungeons were unexplored, before we could raise whole armies with the singnal single &mdash;&quot; he stutters, wetting his tongue with another sip&mdash; &quot;erm, single signal, of a wire.&quot; He waves the document in his hand, and the air is quiet enough to hear the heavy wax seal shake the paper. &quot;This is the lifeblood of our operation. We call them quests.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The cadets cringe. As if any of these tasks could be considered heroic, I think.</p><p>&emsp;Bertram nudges me. &quot;Did this process come out of a fable?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s not slaying monsters. Or, at least, not most of them. Maybe one of our elders has a problem with rats that savaged her Essenced crops, and they might start a fire if they gnaw the wires. Maybe it&apos;s a domestic dispute that needs authority. Or maybe it&apos;s a family near the eastern border that wants to feel safe.</p><p>&emsp;Those are the ones I&apos;ll take, I think.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And then there&apos;s the ones that take a little more courage. Scouting positions. Thrusting yourself just a small distance beyond the lines to make sure there&apos;s nothing there, prodding at the Purgatory Mountains with one of our mentors.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My stomach drops at the thought, but I hate that feeling.</p><p>&emsp;He concludes, &quot;These are the quests you will be completing. And there is always an overwhelming number of them, so you will never have a dull moment. Beyond quests, there are just a few standard competencies that all our guards take to test physical standards: no harder than what you&apos;ve already&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;A cadet cuts him off without raising his hand.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So what, then, we just do them?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You want to wait for me to finish, Pax? Gods above,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;Yes. You take them. You finish them. And you get them signed off and stamped by the ones that wrote them, whether they&apos;re townsfolk or the Knights of the Royal Guard. You hold on to them, and every month you submit them. Along with the results of your competencies.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I can predict the next question before he asks it. All I wonder is if he&apos;ll raise his hand this time, and surely enough:</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, do we have to do some of the hard ones, or else we&apos;ll be sent to the war?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;The nervous air breaks with laughter. Pax&apos;s hand is raised this time, and it stays there.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, of course not. Remember when I said you already proved yourselves? This is only about reaching a minimum.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of how many?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Shut your mouth, Pax,&quot; Ryder says, but he cracks a smile. The room&apos;s laughter grows.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of . . . no number, Gods damn it!&quot; Aldrin balls his fists, but finds relief at how the joyful spirit returns to his young cadets. &quot;You&apos;ll do as many as you think is right. And we&apos;ll see how many you do.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We all seem to feel a little better. The Ahkvas telegraph their feelings the easiest: I can see Cae&apos;s frayed tail loosen as she relaxes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So.&quot; Aldrin clears his throat. &quot;I know that small chance scares you, but I want you to forget it. You&apos;ve worked for years and years to get out into the world beyond the capital, and here you are! You better be damn sure that you live up to that. Get closer with the people of our town. Assimilate yourself into our community. Spend time with your comrades between quests: go hike a trail, head to the hot spring on a day off, and listen well to the senior guardsmen, all right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sir, yes sir!&quot; we shout from habit.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, no! This isn&apos;t training anymore. Stop that,&quot; he barks. &quot;Work hard and live well. Make this time feel like you&apos;re the adventurers of the old days. And, please &mdash; do something other than drink here every night, understood?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sir-&quot; We hesitate, raising our mugs instead.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Fill up, lads,&quot; he says. &quot;A toast to your future!&quot;</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;The fledgling Royal Knights form a line at the kegs, their mugs wavering as suds spill across the warped wooden floorboards. We raise our full cups as color drains from the sky, and somewhere across Lake Garrison, the faint amethyst glow of Chymaeran Essence emanates from the silhouetting pines.</p><p>&emsp;I throw back another two fills on a challenge, and not long after, I find myself among the last of our group. Most of the others left to explore their new townhomes as official trainees of the Royal Guard. Cae and Ryder vanished as soon as possible. Some of the others dragged Pax outside so he wouldn&apos;t vomit on the floor, and I haven&apos;t seen him since.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian is still distant, chatting in the corner with his group of friends. Bertrand sits next to me on the long wooden bench in the corner, careful to keep us from touching though he sits rather close, enough for me to smell the booze on his breath.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You know,&quot; he stammers, &quot;I haven&apos;t said something for a while.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What something?&quot; I ask, afraid to risk standing or else I&apos;ll crash through the coffee table. I twirl the key around my finger in the opposite direction of the twisting world.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Something ever,&quot; he says, then clarifies, &quot;Ever said, yeah.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Ever? Like, ever ever?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Ever,&quot; he says. &quot;Never, I mean. And I don&apos;t know if now is the right time.&quot; Bertrand looks almost uncomfotable. His blue eyes rattle in his skull when he tries to look at me, brushing his dark hair to the side. &quot;I&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;A hand grabs my arm. It&apos;s Jullian.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s time to go home, Katiya,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But why?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because we have to get up early tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;For what?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;For the first day of work, remember?&quot; He says.</p><p>&emsp;I struggle to focus my mind, but I manage to ask the question. &quot;Then why in Khiras&apos; name did the Commander plan a party the night before?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Jullian pauses for a second, while Bertram nods in agreement. &quot;That&apos;s actually a really good question,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;Maybe as a test? Or just so he can scold the ones that don&apos;t show up tomorrow?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I mutter something even I don&apos;t understand when my stomach tries to transition from sitting to standing. My body goes limp when he escorts me from the couch.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian turns to Bertram. &quot;You should leave, too.&quot; He returns an uncomfortable glare when Jullian stabilizes me in an embrace, muttering something about him being mad because his parents gave his name too many L&apos;s.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess we&apos;re going,&quot; I tell Bertram.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, get home safe,&quot; he mutters, losing his campaign against gravity as his body crashes against the vacant bench.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian&apos;s thin as a reed, but he&apos;s strong enough to escort me from the pub. The air is crisp and cold when we step outside. Our boots crunch in the melting frost from winter&apos;s last snowstorm, and we find a relief from the humidity of twenty-some cadets. Beneath his bangs of dirty blonde hair, he always seems to hold a permanent look of discontent, but I know it&apos;s not because he&apos;s angry.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why didn&apos;t you join me? Sitting with all the quiet ones,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re my friends,&quot; I tell him. &quot;And they could be yours if you spent more time with all of them.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He tensions his fingers in mine. &quot;You still could have come by, though.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;And so could you, I think, but it&apos;s less effort to just apologize. &quot;I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know you&apos;re satisfied with the friends you have, but I just want to meet new people. And, compared to the city, our assignment here feels like a second chance for someone like me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I pause for a moment. &quot;What do you mean, &apos;a second chance?&apos;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, no! I mean, I wasted so many years of my life afraid to make friends. It was so easy to tell myself that I shouldn&apos;t bother trying &mdash; that I was too busy taking care of my brothers when my mother spent her days slaving away on the looms.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I nod, coaxing him to continue.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So many of my younger years I wasted. That was until you came along and showed me that I was more than that, that I was worth it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you are worth it,&quot; I say. &quot;You should know that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But do you see what I mean? Most days it feels like I can&apos;t even speak right. You spend you days with one core group of friends because you&apos;ve already figured it out, but every time I gather the courage to speak, it feels like a performance.&quot; He sniffles from the cold. &quot;You&apos;re a bird that was pushed out of the nest at just the right time to learn to fly, but I never left the nest. And now my body is so much heavier, and my wings feel so uncomfortable.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve always said you can practice with me,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But it comes so naturally to you, though. You&apos;re so beautiful. The world begs for you to interact with it, but I&apos;m just average-looking.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;re saying that all I have going for me is my looks?&quot; I grab the collar of his shirt as I slur the words, but not hard enough to come off as real anger. &quot;That&apos;s all you think of me, huh, that I&apos;m just a dazzling piece of arm candy? I&apos;m a Gods-damn warrior!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He stutters over an apology. Maybe he still struggles to tell the difference between anger and sarcasm. My hands tension further around his shirt, and I derive an odd pleasure from seeing him squirm a little here and there.</p><p>&emsp;I feel my fingers trace past his left ear, grazing the hairs of his neck before I draw him down to my height. &quot;Then maybe you can show me with your actions, if the words aren&apos;t enough.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He hesitates for a moment, but the resonant pull of our bodies&apos; Essence is too strong. I can feel his heartbeat hasten as the feeling goads him closer. I plant kisses on his neck, and for several minutes, we allow our anxieties to precipitate the act that absolves them.</p><p>&emsp;The lamplighter walks around us, using his Essence to light the streetlamps, and I nearly lean the two of us into a bush. I can feel him surrender to his instincts when his arms embrace me, and below, I can feel evidence of his excitement.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I think we should get home,&quot; he says. &quot;To yours.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My free hand fumbles for my pocket, then in my pocket, for the iron key labeled BREAKEY-HILDE. It surprises me how well I can do two things at once.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But my stuff from the barracks is still outside,&quot; I say. &quot;I have to unpack!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then we&apos;ll toss it inside,&quot; he says. &quot;You can unpack tomorrow.&quot;</p>"

        "<p id=\"1.3.2.4\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Yet that freedom ends today. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.5\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I find myself here in Gaffesend Tavern, sitting at a bartop, watching the bustling narrow street in front of the grand lake, wondering why Jullian hasn&apos;t bothered to approach me. I hate drinking because it always makes me feel like I&apos;m too weak to face reality. Before long, I realize I&apos;m not watching the exits &mdash; and the more I keep pace with my male comrades, the more I find some stupid hope that this dizziness might shake my own feelings loose. I swirl the crimson ale around in the wooden mug to free the bubbles, envying how easily they float to the surface. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.6\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;An hour passes since the close of labour. The cobblestone streets bustle with villagers returning home from a long day&apos;s work. There are four of us that watch from the window, entranced by the balance of energy between two worlds. Now is that rare hour when the drunken stupor of the pub&apos;s regulars matches the stumble of the tiresome commoners. The sun has already vanished below the mountains, but its colorful influence reflects across the lake.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.7\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I get the spins as my childhood friend Bertram talks to Ryder and Cae, two shy recruits that would sit alone if we weren&apos;t all friends. None of us would be here if they weren&apos;t dangling the keys to our new homes at the end of it, forcing us all to weather the best and worst of our graduating class. Somewhere behind us, the others laugh and cheer. They&apos;ve convinced themselves that this transition is a triumphant victory, too shortsighted to see that life in Gaffesend rides on the results of an enervating final test. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.8\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;There&apos;s no more simulations, practice runs, or drills. Failure is a one-way ticket to the front lines, and I will never get another chance.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.9\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I take another sip, coaxing that feeling of joy to wash over me. I can tell that Bertram thinks the same thoughts when his eyes rest on the village on the other side of the lake. He nudges my right arm before opening his mouth to speak, gesturing to the twelve other trainees behind him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.10\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;To them it&apos;s just a random assignment, no more than the toss of a coin. But to you and I, and maybe Ryder, this is divine. This is the will of the Gods, Katiya. This is the first sentence in our declaration of war.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.11\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I tell him it is, and with my next swallow of ale, I prove it.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.12\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The details are hazy. My mind protects me by forgetting everything I witnessed as a young child, and the harder I push to excise them, the deeper they dig. All I have left is the memory of Bertram pulling me from the smoldering cabin, dragging me to my mother Stella so that our fractured families could escape to the south.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.13\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;For years I was so angry,&quot; I tell him. &quot;If I could have joined the forces then, I would have put off all the schooling. I would have gone straight to the front lines to find justice for what they did to us.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;So why didn&apos;t you?&quot; He asks with a smirk.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I shrug. &quot;How could all Chymaerans be evil if there are people like Pax that have their blood?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I gesture to the half-blooded halfwit behind us. Paxton uses his Chymaeran Essence to try to freeze the watered-down liquor, enough to stack a seventh shot glass as the others cheer him on, drawing the attention of all the other patrons. Even Ryder puts his book down for a second to watch, letting out a small chuckle as it wavers.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You have honor and a kind heart, and it&apos;s what I like about you. What I always have,&quot; Bertram says. He leans close enough that I can feel his firm shoulder press against mine. &quot;But keep enough of that anger. If we don&apos;t make the program &mdash; or if the enemy breaks the lines and crosses the lake in the winter &mdash; that fury is the only thing that&apos;s going to keep us alive.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Rest assured it runs in my circuits with the Essence,&quot; I tell him. &quot;The long winter ends with our probation. It&apos;s spring now, and we have a&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My words cut short when the tower crashes on the eighth glass. Pax presses his face to the table&apos;s surface, sucking up whatever he can of the liquor and the attention. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.2.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But I still find that I&apos;m unable to escape the gravity of that feeling &mdash; that dragging desire that&apos;s followed me since the beginning. The desire to have that one moment that validates all of it, that makes it all worth something. And I pray to the Gods that longing is stronger than the fear of what lies ahead. </p>"

Instead of heading straight to the front lines, you were chosen to challenge yourself with a higher purpose. You demonstrated that you might have what it takes to join our ranks full-time. And starting tomorrow, you&apos;ll get your chance to prove yourself as something special.&quot;</p>",

The Ahkvan swishes her tail with apprehension, and when Aldrin opens his mouth to try to rally us again, she withdraws her face from the mug, saturating the bronze fur on her face with a fine mustache of suds.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.3.7\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Look. I can tell you&apos;re all nervous,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s why I have the kegs here, to try to loosen you up a little,&quot; he says, taking another swig as if it will get him one sip closer to connecting with us. &quot;Trust me, lads. There&apos;s fear in every class &mdash; I&apos;ve seen fifteen in my time, and the reaction is the same every night before. But I want you to understand that you are not fighting for a limited number of slots. There is not a set number: you have already proved your excellence in the Capital. And if you keep that excellence, you will join us. I mean, Katiya&apos;s brother Erik joined us last year.&quot; He turns to me for validation. &quot;Didn&apos;t Erik say it wasn&apos;t that bad?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.3.8\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I say, &quot;It wasn&apos;t bad for his health, at least. Without all the drinking, he dropped a near twenty pounds.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.3.3.11\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We all recongize it immmediately. It was taken straight from the posting board outside the field office.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.3.12\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;This system hearkens back to the old days. Back to those centuries ago when the world was vastly unexplored: those centuries when bands of brave adventurers took tasks to be paid in Kine, back when the empire&apos;s reach was shorter. When ruins and old dungeons were unexplored, before we could raise whole armies with the singnal single &mdash;&quot; he stutters, wetting his tongue with another sip&mdash; &quot;erm, single signal, of a wire.&quot; He waves the document in his hand, and the air is quiet enough to hear the heavy wax seal shake the paper. &quot;This is the lifeblood of our operation. We call them quests.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.3.13\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The cadets cringe. As if any of these tasks could be considered heroic, I think.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.3.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Bertram nudges me. &quot;Did this process come out of a fable?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.3.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s not slaying monsters. Or, at least, not most of them. Maybe one of our elders has a problem with rats that savaged her Essenced crops, and they might start a fire if they gnaw the wires. Maybe it&apos;s a domestic dispute that needs authority. Or maybe it&apos;s a family near the eastern border that wants to feel safe.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.3.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Those are the ones I&apos;ll take, I think.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.3.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And then there&apos;s the ones that take a little more courage. Scouting positions. Thrusting yourself just a small distance beyond the lines to make sure there&apos;s nothing there, prodding at the Purgatory Mountains with one of our mentors.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.3.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My stomach drops at the thought, but I hate that feeling.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.3.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He concludes, &quot;These are the quests you will be completing. And there is always an overwhelming number of them, so you will never have a dull moment. Beyond quests, there are just a few standard competencies that all our guards take to test physical standards: no harder than what you&apos;ve already&mdash;&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.3.3.22\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You want to wait for me to finish, Pax? Gods above,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;Yes. You take them. You finish them. And you get them signed off and stamped by the ones that wrote them, whether they&apos;re townsfolk or the Knights of the Royal Guard. You hold on to them, and every month you submit them. Along with the results of your competencies.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.3.3.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;No, of course not. Remember when I said you already proved yourselves? This is only about reaching a minimum.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.3.3.28\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Shut your mouth, Pax,&quot; Ryder says, but he cracks a smile. The room&apos;s laughter grows.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.3.29\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Of . . . no number, Gods damn it!&quot; Aldrin balls his fists, but finds relief at how the joyful spirit returns to his young cadets. &quot;You&apos;ll do as many as you think is right. And we&apos;ll see how many you do.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.3.30\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We all seem to feel a little better. The Ahkvas telegraph their feelings the easiest: I can see Cae&apos;s frayed tail loosen as she relaxes.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.3.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;So.&quot; Aldrin clears his throat. &quot;I know that small chance scares you, but I want you to forget it. You&apos;ve worked for years and years to get out into the world beyond the capital, and here you are! You better be damn sure that you live up to that. Get closer with the people of our town. Assimilate yourself into our community. Spend time with your comrades between quests: go hike a trail, head to the hot spring on a day off, and listen well to the senior guardsmen, all right?&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.3.4.32\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But do you see what I mean? Most days it feels like I can&apos;t even speak right. You spend you days with one core group of friends because you&apos;ve already figured it out, but every time I gather the courage to speak, it feels like a performance.&quot; He sniffles from the cold. &quot;You&apos;re a bird that was pushed out of the nest at just the right time to learn to fly, but I never left the nest. And now my body is so much heavier, and my wings feel so uncomfortable.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.3.4.34\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But it comes so naturally to you, though. You&apos;re so beautiful. The world begs for you to interact with it, but I&apos;m just average-looking.&quot;</p>",

I&apos;m a Gods-damn warrior!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.4.36\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He stutters over an apology. Maybe he still struggles to tell the difference between anger and sarcasm. My hands tension further around his shirt, and I derive an odd pleasure from seeing him squirm a little here and there.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.3.4.37\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I feel my fingers trace past his left ear, grazing the hairs of his neck before I draw him down to my height. &quot;Then maybe you can show me with your actions, if the words aren&apos;t enough.&quot;</p>",

      "<p>&emsp;&quot;I can unpack it all tomorrow. Let&apos;s just toss it all inside.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you have to unpack,&quot; my mom says. &quot;All the stuff from your bedroom is still in our living room!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;It surprises me how incapable I am of doing two things at once. As I approach my car, my free hand fumbles in my pocket, searching for my keys, and I grab them by the piece of painters&apos; tape that&apos;s still stuck to the new house key.The blue strip is scribed in Sharpie with the name DUNSMORE, and as I flip it around with a single hand to grab my car key, I nearly trip down the switchback of concrete stairs leading to the parking lot, launching my keys into the air.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What happened?&quot; My mother asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nearly tripped down the stairs,&quot; I say. &quot;You know the aerospace guys have an elevator? Their entrance looks like some kind of brutalist doomsday bunker. Our stairway is so worn from forty years, it&apos;s practically a slide.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; she says. &quot;Well, we said we were going to do this today, and Dad has his RV convention tomorrow morning, so we can&apos;t do it then.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He doesn&apos;t have to help,&quot; I say. &quot;I literally got my degree in how to measure stuff. I&apos;m more than capable of drilling holes in the wall, you know.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you know how excited he is to help you, Cody,&quot; she says. &quot;He wouldn&apos;t stop telling the Richards at dinner how excited he is that his boy&apos;s moving out. &apos;Forging his own way,&apos; I think he said.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Really?&quot; I stoop down to grab the keys, careful not to twist my damn ankle even further. &quot;It&apos;s spring now. Who&apos;s going to mow the lawn the way he likes it? I don&apos;t think any of the neighbor kids are gonna mow it twice just so it can have that fancy &apos;checker&apos; look. They can&apos;t be bought off with ice cream like me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re doing that thing where you try to change the subject,&quot; she says. &quot;We&apos;re coming over today, Cody,&quot; then adds, &quot;at least we&apos;re getting it over with. Then you won&apos;t have to see us for a week.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not like that,&quot; I insist. &quot;You guys are everything to me. Why do you think I moved so close? So you can do my laundry?&quot; I trundle through the vacant, dusty lot as I hold the end of the key to my chin, spamming the lock button. A few steps later, my Subaru chirps in response: one of the few cars left in the hundred-car-lot, parked in the last spot left against the tall barbed-wire fence. Drained of my stamina after three emails and a few redlines, I try not to audibly sigh, doing the math on how much time I have to relax before we spend the rest of the evening playing Tetris with my furniture.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, we love you. And we want you to know how proud of you we are. Our boy is moving up in the world. A mortgage? And his first house?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Old, I know. I&apos;ll check the mail tomorrow for my AARP card.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And maybe next, you&apos;ll find that special person.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I groan. &quot;You&apos;ll get your grandkids when you get them.&quot; I finally break the long shadow of the Aerospace division&apos;s building when I make it to the fence, feeling the setting sun warm the back of my neck. &quot; I&apos;ll talk to you later.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re proud of you,&quot; she insists.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; I say, hinging open the car door to deposit myself in the driver&apos;s seat as shadow consumes the full span of the lot. I turn the key and the engine hums to life, taking one last glance to the top of the crumbling stairwell to confirm Kei&apos;s refusal to start her weekend. </p><p>&emsp;But her Ford Fiesta is still here, collecting dust as the last car on the lot.</p><p>&emsp;Alone, I still feel a small sense of warmth inside me. A part of me is glad I chose to stay close. Beyond that oasis of unrelenting love is a desert, and when I&apos;m not surrounded by the family that help me forget, it&apos;s a boundless journey where the scenery never changes, just like those long stretches of barren road when I drove to university, on long breaks between semesters. </p><p>&emsp;Maybe that&apos;s why I find comfort in returning home to the forest, where the horizon is obscured by trees. When I drive home from a long day at Navidson-Monroe, slithering down switchbacks of the Shaleborough foothills in my WRX, I watch the graduation tassle from high school sway with the curves, feeling a hint of the same exhilaration when my friends and I used to drive the other way, climbing the asphalt turns until the roads switched to trails, settling somewhere between the mountains for another adventurous chapter in a childhood summer.</p><p>&emsp;But the sun has set, and the association I had with this road has been wholly overwritten with the feelings I&apos;ve carried home. Nav&apos;s words seem to follow that feeling of residual guilt when I consider how behind I always am. Time used to be segmented in semesters, quarters, and classes, but the demands of the customer are endless and indivisible. </p><p>&emsp;At least it means that business is well &mdash; far better than being afraid of layoffs.</p><p>&emsp;When I crank up the playlist my friends and I made together, lower the sun roof, crack the windows, and allow the throttle to twist my stomach as I accelerate around the curves, I find I&apos;m able to let those cherished memories win over.</p><p>&emsp;And then a call comes over the hands-free system.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I press the button on the steering wheel, and CALL ACTIVE flashes in segmented letters on the LCD. Hearing his voice over the phone makes it feel like he&apos;s speeding around the curves in the car in front of me, calling to ask if we can stop off at Sonic for a milkshake before we unpack the tents from our cars.</p><p>&emsp; But many years have passed since those summers.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey, buddy.&quot; His voice is raspy over the phone. &quot;How have you been?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Pretty good, Scott,&quot; I say, making sure to pitch my voice up.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just wanted to call to check in with you. I saw you just got a new place in our hometown. Congrats!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; I tell him. &quot;And I saw you got a new place around Orange County. A full-size house?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You know how Kaycee&apos;s parents are,&quot; he says. &quot;I guess it&apos;s what happens when you&apos;re an only child.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I wish it worked that way for me,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So then I guess I should thank you for setting us up,&quot; Scott says. &quot;What about you? Any progress in your love life?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not yet, buddy. I&apos;m starting to think I missed the chance.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I always thought you&apos;d get together with Kei. Didn&apos;t you tell me last time that she works with you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My fingers tension around the steering wheel, and I find I&apos;m taking the turns sharper. &quot;I&apos;m not so sure, but I&apos;m doing what I can.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not just calling to check up on you. I&apos;m calling for two things. First, I wanted to tell you that Kaycee and I are gonna be in Colorado in a couple weeks.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, really? That&apos;s great,&quot; I tell him. &quot;We should meet up.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Absolutely. And it&apos;s tied in with the second thing.&quot; Scott takes a long pause, and the phone&apos;s static gives way to the hum of my car&apos;s engine. &quot;I proposed to Kaycee, and she said &apos;yes.&apos;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. That&apos;s fantastic!&quot; I tell him. &quot;I&apos;m so happy for you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you&apos;ve been my closest friend since the beginning. I wanted this to be a question I ask you in person, when we drive out there, but . . . I want you to be in my wedding. I&apos;ve thought about it a while, and, well . . . I was wondering if you would be my Best Man.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I feel a rare feeling of elation overtake me. &quot;I would be honored to be that for you, Scott.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Great! Great,&quot; he says. &quot;We can talk about it more when I head out there. From the championship lacrosse team with you and Miguel, to all those sleepovers in your basement, to those summer trips up to the mountains, I mean, you&apos;ve been there for all of it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I drive down that same road we took camping every day,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, you finally made it into Navidson-Monroe, you nerd. Designing rockets?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not quite yet,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you&apos;ll get there. And at this wedding, if you haven&apos;t confessed your feelings to Kei, I&apos;ll get you together with one of Kaycee&apos;s bridesmaids. You know California &mdash; she&apos;s got some really pretty friends. And Kylie&apos;s gonna be there too. The &apos;Burnett&apos;s girl,&apos; remember? Didn&apos;t you guys hit it off in the freshman dorms?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I laugh. &quot;Thanks, buddy. I&apos;ll look forward to it, then.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure.&quot; He pauses for a moment, as if deciding whether to end the call. My thumb feathers the END CALL button on the steering wheel, but then he pipes up.</p><p>&emsp;His voice cracks: &quot;You know, you were the one that brought all of us together. You were the &apos;uniter&apos; of all our friends, I guess. And the further I get from those years, you know . . . I miss that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My grasp loosens on the steering wheel as I struggle to remember the last time I ever hung out with more than one person at a time. Sometimes it feels like adulthood just gives us more convenient excuses to stay alone. But it feels wrong to dwell too long on stuff that far in the past.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks. I miss those days too,&quot; I say. &quot;Call me again sometime before you head out here. We&apos;ll plan a day downtown in Denver.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Will do,&quot; he says. The line clicks. All that&apos;s left is the hum of the engine as I reach the bottom of the foothills, stuck in the space between songs when the vocals feather away.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m stopped at a red light at a vacant crossroads. My left hand drums against the side of the car, keeping a beat without a song. It&apos;s always when I&apos;m the most still that I feel the flow of time, seconds ticking away with the rhythmic, harmonic shake of the engine. The discomfort of this stillness overtakes me as I sit here second after second without a single car passing, but the light is still green on the crossway. The crossroads is pitch black, and the feeling of emptiness rises my flesh with static like a sleeping limb.</p><p>&emsp;The feeling of itching stillness begins to return to me, that call of the void, and I feel it&apos;s presence as if it were sitting in the backseat, in the space where my friends used to be. I drop the pedal to the floor before the light can change, longing for that feeling of inertia to lull me back to peace: ripping through the intersection before the light can change.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;A Bankers Box is the last thing I have to store away in the small closet beneath the stairs. It&apos;s somehow lived to service my family through many moves, and the yellowed white of the cardboard is long-aged to prove it.  First is the word OFFICE in my mother&apos;s cursive from twenty-some years ago. That was scratched out to say COLLEGE STUFF in my father&apos;s handwriting five years ago. Four years later, for the long move back, I amended that with a semicolon, adding ENGINEERING TEXTBOOKS (AND SHIT) in my fine block script to help clarify. And now &mdash; so redacted it looks like a square Dalmatian &mdash; it reads CODY DUNSMORE, FIRST HOME.</p><p>&emsp;Inside is all the hobby stuff I used to like when I had the energy: a mess of soldering tips, beer-can capacitors and resistors as if I went back to the 90s and robbed a Radio Shack. There&apos;s a couple games I picked up when Mom drove me to GameStop for midnight releases with my buddies, and weighing it down is the signed lacrosse ball from the last Varsity game that let me letter in high school.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You know, for a new home owner, you sure have a lot of crap to start,&quot; my father says. &quot;Your mother and I started with nothing. Nothing!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But it is a whole lot of nothing.&quot; I gesture to the lonely folding chair and cheap television in the small foyer. &quot;The modern man needs very little to be satisfied.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just hope it&apos;s enough to survive,&quot; my mother says. She rubs her temples.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just glad it comes with a washer and dryer. Otherwise I&apos;d have to buy new clothes every week.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Dear Lord, Alan. Did we raise him?&quot; She turns to my father. &quot;Did he forget how to wash clothes some time in college?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He&apos;ll be fine, Kim,&quot; Dad says. </p><p>&emsp;It humors us when she gets the panicked look on her face. Neither of us can tell if it&apos;s a joke.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You remember? She&apos;s only washed my clothes since I got back from school. I think I remember how to do it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you need to keep your shirts nice. For work,&quot; she says. &quot;You need to iron them. Did you get an ironing board?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I get it. I know, and I will, tomorrow,&quot; I tell her. &quot;You remember I&apos;ve been working there for two years, right? Everybody just wears jeans. Some even T-shirts.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Dad&apos;s face furrows at the thought. &quot;Dressing like that won&apos;t get you a promotion.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, they make fun of me when I dress up enough to tuck in my shirt. Saying I&apos;m trying to take their jobs.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, then . . .&quot; Dad starts, but his words trail off. </p><p>&emsp;The silence returns to us: it&apos;s a pivotal moment in our relationship. They were empty-nesters for four years, and right when they got used to it, they had me again for another two.  The childhood home will be so quiet: maybe it deafens them. I remember my mom kept the room and bed so neat every time I returned from college.</p><p>&emsp;Maybe there are phases to it, just like my late brother&apos;s room was all those years ago. It was as still as a museum for months. All his books and participation trophies were scattered thoughtfully as if he had just left the house to go see friends for a really, really long time, his letterman&apos;s jacket glistening with pins on the chair, and I almost thought they were planning on putting the whole room behind glass, until one windy day showed them it&apos;d be safer in seventeen boxes. </p><p>&emsp;Cardboard. </p><p>&emsp;Not like the polished wooden box beneath the ground, protecting all the things the war couldn&apos;t take.</p><p>&emsp;They head towards the door and turn the knob, still chipper despite how it drags on all of us, and my father wants to show it the least. </p><p>&emsp;I almost think I can hear his voice crack. &quot;Just promise us you&apos;ll visit, right? Dinner next week?&quot; And to make it less emasculating, he adds, &quot;Your mother will go nuts if she can&apos;t do a load of laundry at least once a month.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I swear I&apos;ll never do it again,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I promise,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And maybe you can bring over a girl,&quot; Dad says. &quot;Don&apos;t get me wrong. You did great in school, but we&apos;re never gonna have grandchildren at this rate.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, Alan,&quot; Mom says. I think she&apos;s gonna shake her head or admonish him. </p><p>&emsp;But she surprises me. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re right. Wasn&apos;t there a reason Cody insisted on that queen-size bed?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And the spare bedroom. He&apos;s smart. Put a bed in there and he&apos;s got a fine doghouse.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. The gaming room, you mean?&quot; I ask, and they&apos;re half out the door before Dad answers.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Lonely girls his age start collecting cats. I just pray you don&apos;t do that with games on that computer program you were showing me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I hold the smile though their words cut me, though they don&apos;t realize it. </p><p>&emsp;This isn&apos;t the way I wanted this memory to end.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe you can get that girl from work to come over. The older one you went to prom with. The asian one,&quot; Dad says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s enough,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;I give my mother and father a hug. I squeeze my mother a little longer because she likes them, and I swear I can feel her tremble, just a little, and when they head for the car, my mother chokes on the last words before she&apos;ll probably lose it.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We love you, Cody. We&apos;re so proud of you,&quot; she says, loud enough that all my new neighbors can hear.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks. I love you too,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;I wave for a while as they depart, blasting the 80s love songs through their windows as my father ducks his head.</p><p>&emsp;I retreat through the threshold of the doorway, hesitating to close the door or else the suddenness of this new chapter might give me whiplash. A couple tears leave my eyes. I sniff. It&apos;s a bright March day, and somewhere beyond the spotless windows, the birds sing songs in staccato, coupled with the chattering rumble of new construction.</p><p>&emsp;I flick the lights on, then off, then on again, then settle for off. I sit at the head of the glass dining table to find myself in a familiar headspace, from all those years ago in college, when my roommates left to drive home to their families, and flying for me wasn&apos;t an option. In the small closet beneath the stairs is the Bankers Box, and somewhere inside my head I wonder how I can ever reignite those old passions.</p><p>&emsp;I sit there until tinnitus rings in my ears. I don&apos;t feel like gaming, going for a walk, or saying hello to the neighbors. I love my parents to pieces, but their words still cut me. I mean, I&apos;m twenty-six years old: is this the age where you start to really believe you&apos;ll be alone forever? </p><p>&emsp;The comebacks always come to you long after they&apos;re useful. I open the fridge my mom overstocked with frozen food from Costco in case I starve in the next three months and grab an off-brand seltzer, returning to darkness when the door closes. </p><p>&emsp;Then maybe he should have stayed. He was smarter, more attractive, more alive than I can ever be, I could have said. Communication was what killed him. And I refuse to harm my relationship with my parents over it. But really, what do they think? Some neighbor girl is going to stumble in here looking for love?</p><p>&emsp;The thoughts get me nowhere, but the seltzer does. And when the clock reads 8:00 PM, three deep with the gold-painted cans standing like little league trophies on the finely-polished counter, I&apos;m finally able to forget. And I forget even easier when he stumbles through the open door.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Beer later, wey. Wanna hotbox my car?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He slicks his black hair back before dragging his feet on my mat, carrying a rack of cheap beer with an OfficeMax nametag pinned upside-down.</p>"

        "<p id=\"1.4.2.6\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; I tell him. &quot;And I saw you got a new place around Orange County. A full-size house?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.7\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You know how Kaycee&apos;s parents are,&quot; he says. &quot;I guess it&apos;s what happens when you&apos;re an only child.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.8\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I wish it worked that way for me,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.9\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;So then I guess I should thank you for setting us up,&quot; Scott says. &quot;What about you? Any progress in your love life?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.10\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Not yet, buddy. I&apos;m starting to think I missed the chance.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.11\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I always thought you&apos;d get together with Kei. Didn&apos;t you tell me last time that she works with you?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My fingers tension around the steering wheel, and I find I&apos;m taking the turns sharper. &quot;I&apos;m not so sure, but I&apos;m doing what I can.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not just calling to check up on you. I&apos;m calling for two things. First, I wanted to tell you that Kaycee and I are gonna be in Colorado in a couple weeks.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh, really? That&apos;s great,&quot; I tell him. &quot;We should meet up.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Absolutely. And it&apos;s tied in with the second thing.&quot; Scott takes a long pause, and the phone&apos;s static gives way to the hum of my car&apos;s engine. &quot;I proposed to Kaycee, and she said &apos;yes.&apos;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh. That&apos;s fantastic!&quot; I tell him. &quot;I&apos;m so happy for you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Well, you&apos;ve been my closest friend since the beginning. I wanted this to be a question I ask you in person, when we drive out there, but . . . I want you to be in my wedding. I&apos;ve thought about it a while, and, well . . . I was wondering if you would be my Best Man.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I feel a rare feeling of elation overtake me. &quot;I would be honored to be that for you, Scott.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Great! Great,&quot; he says. &quot;We can talk about it more when I head out there. From the championship lacrosse team with you and Miguel, to all those sleepovers in your basement, to those summer trips up to the mountains, I mean, you&apos;ve been there for all of it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I drive down that same road we took camping every day,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah, you finally made it into Navidson-Monroe, you nerd. Designing rockets?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Not quite yet,&quot; I tell him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.23\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Well, you&apos;ll get there. And at this wedding, if you haven&apos;t confessed your feelings to Kei, I&apos;ll get you together with one of Kaycee&apos;s bridesmaids. You know California &mdash; she&apos;s got some really pretty friends. And Kylie&apos;s gonna be there too. The &apos;Burnett&apos;s girl,&apos; remember? Didn&apos;t you guys hit it off in the freshman dorms?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I laugh. &quot;Thanks, buddy. I&apos;ll look forward to it, then.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Sure.&quot; He pauses for a moment, as if deciding whether to end the call. My thumb feathers the END CALL button on the steering wheel, but then he pipes up.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;His voice cracks: &quot;You know, you were the one that brought all of us together. You were the &apos;uniter&apos; of all our friends, I guess. And the further I get from those years, you know . . . I miss that.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My grasp loosens on the steering wheel as I struggle to remember the last time I ever hung out with more than one person at a time. Sometimes it feels like adulthood just gives us more convenient excuses to stay alone. But it feels wrong to dwell too long on stuff that far in the past.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Thanks. I miss those days too,&quot; I say. &quot;Call me again sometime before you head out here. We&apos;ll plan a day downtown in Denver.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Will do,&quot; he says. The line clicks. All that&apos;s left is the hum of the engine as I reach the bottom of the foothills, stuck in the space between songs when the vocals feather away.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I&apos;m stopped at a red light at a vacant crossroads. My left hand drums against the side of the car, keeping a beat without a song. It&apos;s always when I&apos;m the most still that I feel the flow of time, seconds ticking away with the rhythmic, harmonic shake of the engine. The discomfort of this stillness overtakes me as I sit here second after second without a single car passing, but the light is still green on the crossway. The crossroads is pitch black, and the feeling of emptiness rises my flesh with static like a sleeping limb.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.2.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The feeling of itching stillness begins to return to me, that call of the void, and I feel it&apos;s presence as if it were sitting in the backseat, in the space where my friends used to be. I drop the pedal to the floor before the light can change, longing for that feeling of inertia to lull me back to peace: ripping through the intersection before the light can change.</p>"

        "<p id=\"1.4.3.1\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;A Bankers Box is the last thing I have to store away in the small closet beneath the stairs. It&apos;s somehow lived to service my family through many moves, and the yellowed white of the cardboard is long-aged to prove it.  First is the word OFFICE in my mother&apos;s cursive from twenty-some years ago. That was scratched out to say COLLEGE STUFF in my father&apos;s handwriting five years ago. Four years later, for the long move back, I amended that with a semicolon, adding ENGINEERING TEXTBOOKS (AND SHIT) in my fine block script to help clarify. And now &mdash; so redacted it looks like a square Dalmatian &mdash; it reads CODY DUNSMORE, FIRST HOME.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.2\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Inside is all the hobby stuff I used to like when I had the energy: a mess of soldering tips, beer-can capacitors and resistors as if I went back to the 90s and robbed a Radio Shack. There&apos;s a couple games I picked up when Mom drove me to GameStop for midnight releases with my buddies, and weighing it down is the signed lacrosse ball from the last Varsity game that let me letter in high school.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.3\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You know, for a new home owner, you sure have a lot of crap to start,&quot; my father says. &quot;Your mother and I started with nothing. Nothing!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.4\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But it is a whole lot of nothing.&quot; I gesture to the lonely folding chair and cheap television in the small foyer. &quot;The modern man needs very little to be satisfied.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.5\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I just hope it&apos;s enough to survive,&quot; my mother says. She rubs her temples.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.6\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just glad it comes with a washer and dryer. Otherwise I&apos;d have to buy new clothes every week.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.7\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Dear Lord, Alan. Did we raise him?&quot; She turns to my father. &quot;Did he forget how to wash clothes some time in college?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.8\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;He&apos;ll be fine, Kim,&quot; Dad says. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.9\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;It humors us when she gets the panicked look on her face. Neither of us can tell if it&apos;s a joke.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.10\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You remember? She&apos;s only washed my clothes since I got back from school. I think I remember how to do it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.11\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But you need to keep your shirts nice. For work,&quot; she says. &quot;You need to iron them. Did you get an ironing board?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I get it. I know, and I will, tomorrow,&quot; I tell her. &quot;You remember I&apos;ve been working there for two years, right? Everybody just wears jeans. Some even T-shirts.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Dad&apos;s face furrows at the thought. &quot;Dressing like that won&apos;t get you a promotion.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Well, they make fun of me when I dress up enough to tuck in my shirt. Saying I&apos;m trying to take their jobs.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Well, then . . .&quot; Dad starts, but his words trail off. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The silence returns to us: it&apos;s a pivotal moment in our relationship. They were empty-nesters for four years, and right when they got used to it, they had me again for another two.  The childhood home will be so quiet: maybe it deafens them. I remember my mom kept the room and bed so neat every time I returned from college.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Maybe there are phases to it, just like my late brother&apos;s room was all those years ago. It was as still as a museum for months. All his books and participation trophies were scattered thoughtfully as if he had just left the house to go see friends for a really, really long time, his letterman&apos;s jacket glistening with pins on the chair, and I almost thought they were planning on putting the whole room behind glass, until one windy day showed them it&apos;d be safer in seventeen boxes. </p>",

        "<p id=\"1.4.3.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;They head towards the door and turn the knob, still chipper despite how it drags on all of us, and my father wants to show it the least. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I almost think I can hear his voice crack. &quot;Just promise us you&apos;ll visit, right? Dinner next week?&quot; And to make it less emasculating, he adds, &quot;Your mother will go nuts if she can&apos;t do a load of laundry at least once a month.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.4.3.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;And maybe you can bring over a girl,&quot; Dad says. &quot;Don&apos;t get me wrong. You did great in school, but we&apos;re never gonna have grandchildren at this rate.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh, Alan,&quot; Mom says. I think she&apos;s gonna shake her head or admonish him. </p>",

        "<p id=\"1.4.3.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re right. Wasn&apos;t there a reason Cody insisted on that queen-size bed?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;And the spare bedroom. He&apos;s smart. Put a bed in there and he&apos;s got a fine doghouse.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh. The gaming room, you mean?&quot; I ask, and they&apos;re half out the door before Dad answers.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Lonely girls his age start collecting cats. I just pray you don&apos;t do that with games on that computer program you were showing me.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I hold the smile though their words cut me, though they don&apos;t realize it. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;This isn&apos;t the way I wanted this memory to end.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Maybe you can get that girl from work to come over. The older one you went to prom with. The asian one,&quot; Dad says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.34\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s enough,&quot; I tell him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.35\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I give my mother and father a hug. I squeeze my mother a little longer because she likes them, and I swear I can feel her tremble, just a little, and when they head for the car, my mother chokes on the last words before she&apos;ll probably lose it.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.36\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;We love you, Cody. We&apos;re so proud of you,&quot; she says, loud enough that all my new neighbors can hear.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.37\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Thanks. I love you too,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.38\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I wave for a while as they depart, blasting the 80s love songs through their windows as my father ducks his head.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.39\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I retreat through the threshold of the doorway, hesitating to close the door or else the suddenness of this new chapter might give me whiplash. A couple tears leave my eyes. I sniff. It&apos;s a bright March day, and somewhere beyond the spotless windows, the birds sing songs in staccato, coupled with the chattering rumble of new construction.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.40\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I flick the lights on, then off, then on again, then settle for off. I sit at the head of the glass dining table to find myself in a familiar headspace, from all those years ago in college, when my roommates left to drive home to their families, and flying for me wasn&apos;t an option. In the small closet beneath the stairs is the Bankers Box, and somewhere inside my head I wonder how I can ever reignite those old passions.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.41\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I sit there until tinnitus rings in my ears. I don&apos;t feel like gaming, going for a walk, or saying hello to the neighbors. I love my parents to pieces, but their words still cut me. I mean, I&apos;m twenty-six years old: is this the age where you start to really believe you&apos;ll be alone forever? </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.42\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The comebacks always come to you long after they&apos;re useful. I open the fridge my mom overstocked with frozen food from Costco in case I starve in the next three months and grab an off-brand seltzer, returning to darkness when the door closes. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.43\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Then maybe he should have stayed. He was smarter, more attractive, more alive than I can ever be, I could have said. Communication was what killed him. And I refuse to harm my relationship with my parents over it. But really, what do they think? Some neighbor girl is going to stumble in here looking for love?</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.44\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The thoughts get me nowhere, but the seltzer does. And when the clock reads 8:00 PM, three deep with the gold-painted cans standing like little league trophies on the finely-polished counter, I&apos;m finally able to forget. And I forget even easier when he stumbles through the open door.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.45\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Beer later, wey. Wanna hotbox my car?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.4.3.46\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He slicks his black hair back before dragging his feet on my mat, carrying a rack of cheap beer with an OfficeMax nametag pinned upside-down.</p>"

      "<p>&emsp;The next lucid moment, I find myself pinned upside-down beneath a thick wooden rack. The heat climbs as I drag my heels across the floor, my clothes so black and charred that I pray my sweaty flesh might slick me back through the narrow space. Within the hot box of crackling logs and scalding cinders, the roar of recircling flames makes the house screech in agony when its bones crunch and crumble, casting twigs and thatch to the ashen floor.</p><p>&emsp;The twisting and thrashing gets me nowhere, but when a log column crashes into the thin floor, the rack slides into the hollow foundation. My body is so small and pathetic, but I&apos;m barely able to command my cramped muscles to escape, crawling across the floor as the smoke billows overhead, drawing shallow, stinging breaths into  my pinched lungs. </p><p>&emsp;The log walls close in like long fingers of a burning fist that clenches, casting glowing rubies of raging ruin that spread like a rash across the cabin&apos;s bones, and as I gasp harder for desperate breaths, losing the strength of air to drive my muscles, I realize that all the windows and doors are missing.</p><p>&emsp;The heat would evaporate my tears if I had the fluids left to cry. All that&apos;s left is to feel how much I loathe this feeling of helplessness. Didn&apos;t I escape this crumbling crypt of cinders? Or was the full life I led after just a dream of a dying mind, denying its demise? Didn&apos;t Stella and Erik and Bertram treat my burns as we sought solitude on the outskirts of Northaven? Or is this the last memory of my soul in the Reservoir, preparing to be reborn?</p><p>&emsp;But this body is so weak and useless, and I lust so strongly for power, for Essence: Essence that might let me bend steel; to bash through the walls; to crush the skulls of the arsonists. I only wish I could live to return the favor, to get revenge for that fading image of their faces.</p><p>&emsp;But I&apos;m just a child, and nobody came.</p><p>&emsp;The last segment of wall collapses, and I join my father and sisters,  entombed forever beneath the rubble. </p><p>&emsp;Or so I think, until I gasp for breath beneath the silken sheets of an unfamiliar bed.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;It takes a couple seconds before my mind is able to catch up on two decades of living history. It&apos;s not the first time my mind tormented me with visions of another life, one where the Gods of fortune hadn&apos;t intervened. My episodes were worse in the Barracks: so bad that they threw me in with all the other traumatized children of the war that tossed and turned too much in their sleep, waking the others with the foreshadowing shouts and screams of the slaughter that might await them.</p><p>&emsp;I always think I can be stronger. I always find myself thinking I can outmaneuver it, but it matters not how viciously I fight to comport myself. That poisonous malady of the soul is an everflowing source of suffering stronger than the sea. And even as I sit here with full recollection of everything that&apos;s brought me to this moment, I still can&apos;t shake that feeling of eternal freefall, that uncomfortable feathering in my stomach that casts my fingers and toes in phantom static, waiting and waiting for when I&apos;ll splatter against the end of this bottomless pit.</p><p>&emsp;But the end never comes. The only way, it seems, is to distract myself from the infinite fall, so that feeling becomes a lesser part of me. I&apos;ve tried hating it, but it never concedes. I&apos;ve tried overpowering it, but it&apos;s like sculpting water. So all I can do is follow the words of my father when these episodes would overtake me.</p><p>&emsp;Katiya, he would say. My beautiful daughter, you have to focus. Tell me, where are you right now?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m in the town of Gaffesend, across the lake from where we used to live,&quot; I mutter, clutching my chest with numbing fingers that hinge against my will. My other hand reaches for the left side of the bed as I call out his name, longing for a touch beyond lust, but the bed is cold again: damp with his sweat from our passions the night before.</p><p>&emsp;Where are you?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m in my new home. In the bedroom,&quot; I breathe. &quot;With plastered walls,&quot; I breathe. &quot;And a fan,&quot; I breathe, taking two breaths before the next distracting question comes to me I cast a look around as my eyes adjust from the dark of sleep to the brightness of morning.</p><p>&emsp;When are you?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A near twenty years after I lost you.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s the hundred-and-twenty-ninth year after the Fall. A long winter fades into spring as the world opens again, and I can smell the buds of flowers blooming in the wild spaces. &quot;I&apos;ve come back to find something I lost, I think,&quot; I add.</p><p>&emsp;And can you describe how you feel?</p><p>&emsp;My breaths are slowing. My heart is acclimating to the stillness, and my body is accepting there&apos;s nothing that threatens it, even though I&apos;ve already identified all the exits. I must have flamed a little in my sleep: there are small burn holes where my naked body pressed hardest against the fabric. The sheets are saturated with soot from the scalding heat my circuits must have risen, but that&apos;s not what upsets me the most. As the world returns to me, I can feel my fists ball on a different kind of anger.</p><p>&emsp;I thought the passion of the night before might have compelled Jullian him to stay. The feeling of that truth feels so palpable when he kisses me, and for the hour after, my mind floats on the joy of all we&apos;ve shared: watching each other&apos;s siblings; studying those long nights together; even training in the early mornings; and all the time we&apos;d set aside for each other despite everything.</p><p>&emsp;Maybe it&apos;s the annoyed sigh he breathes when I goad him on the morning runs around the village, one of our traditions. Or maybe it&apos;s in the listless tick he acquired any time we walk about the village. Or maybe it&apos;s in his new group of friends &mdash; though he&apos;s always longed for a group to belong to, and I don&apos;t fault him for any of that.</p><p>&emsp;But he wasn&apos;t here when I needed him. The only considerate act was topping off the Essence switch with a touch, allowing the ceiling fan enough energy to run until I awoke. His clothes vanished as if he was trying to clear a crime scene.</p><p>&emsp;After I release myself from the tangle of bedsheets, I  poke my head out the back window facing west &mdash; nearly forgetting to cover my breasts with the thick red curtain as I try to guess the time. It&apos;s a commerce street,  and the stalls are vacant without produce or trinkets, the stools still tucked beneath the counters. The merchants tend to gather an hour after sunrise, meaning it&apos;s long before the time that we were told to gather outside the officer post.</p><p>&emsp;I glance out the east window that looks out upon a quaint little garden: my tiny lawn with a walkway that divides it, enclosed by the spires of a wrought-iron fence. The mountain air is so crisp and fresh as it pours though the windows, wrapping around the curtain that covers my extremities, and when I lift my eyes to the Purgatory Mountains, feeling the morning sun radiate my skin, I find a captivating view of Lake Gaffesend.</p><p>&emsp;The Gods of fortune haven&apos;t forgotten me, I think: but I refuse to ever lean on them with all my weight.</p><p>&emsp;I find the closet furnished to the measurements I gave at Orientation, though almost everything seems to be genderless. The underwear is the only thing that&apos;s distinctly feminine, and after smelling myself to ensure the stench of sweat is not severe, I slip on a pair, and proceed to dress in the Royal Guard&apos;s underclothes.</p><p>&emsp;The white undershirt is baggy, but not too long in the sleeves. I&apos;m just relieved to not have to wear the same binder I wore for graduation.

      "<p>&emsp;I descend the stairs in bare feet, carrying the thin cosmetic armor.

My arms are all twisted inside the uncompromising metal. &quot;Thanks for the warning.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not a problem, love,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;As I struggle to free myself from my metal cocoon, I recognize that there&apos;s a hinged strap on the side: something that would have made the struggle a whole lot easier.</p><p>&emsp;But then a sizzling sound sets off behind me. I&apos;m so charged with Essence that I must&apos;ve transferred too much to the burner. The porridge bubbles over the edges of the pot, edging off the wooden spoon that bridged the center. Scrambling from the floor, I reach my hand to withdraw heat from the stove, feeling that transfer of energy return to my circuits.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Gods damn it,&quot; I tell myself. And when I reach to grasp the handle of the pot, my foot slips in a mess of oats on the floor, casting a plume of molten chunks across the floorboards and the cabinetry.</p><p>&emsp;A voice rises from the other side of the house: a different pitch with the same sentiment.</p><p>&emsp; &quot;You alright in there, Aleena?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Aleena? Who&apos;s Aleena?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, just a little accident,&quot; I say. &quot;Looks like I&apos;ll be skipping breakfast.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You can&apos;t miss breakfast if you&apos;re defending the village,&quot; he says. &quot;Come to the window.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;One second,&quot; I say, before throwing my armor on the right way, finding  buckles and straps that are stitched there for a reason. When I&apos;m sufficiently sharp, clothed in bright crimson and silver that&apos;s trimmed with gold, I reach for the window sill to drag it open.</p><p>&emsp;A stocky, bald man squats on one of the stools in the shadow of the building, his collection of fresh breads proudly displayed across the front of the booth.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re not Aleena. Your voice sounds like hers, though. Are you a friend?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is my new house,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. Sorry,&quot; he says. &quot;Well, you&apos;re certainly prettier than she was!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;A hand slaps him across the cheek. I bend down to see where it came from, and it&apos;s his wife, unloading the rest of their produce: they must have just arrived.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m Derry. And this is my wife, Carmen. We sell fresh bread here every morning.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I shake their hands, bending awkwardly to meet their eyes from four feet off of street level.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The last girl preferred waking to the smell of fresh bread,&quot; Carmen says. &quot;She regaled us with tales of her travels in exchange for a loaf. Maybe you can do the same?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My peckishness speaks first. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course. What do I owe you?&quot; I ask, drawing my fingers into my coin purse for a couple Kine.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The first one&apos;s free, because I think you&apos;ll make a great customer. It&apos;s fresh, with a special blend of spices in there,&quot; he insists.</p><p>&emsp;His wife turns from unloading the cart. &quot;Say, what happened to the other girl?&quot;</p><p>&emsp; I withdraw the key from my pocket: without the cover of night or blurred vision, I can inspect it a lot easier. The surface is rough where her name was ground away. I can see the shape of her letters interspersed between mine. It&apos;s been sanded enough that I&apos;m sure she&apos;s not the first: it&apos;s evident that the names of cadets were stacked and scratched nearly halfway through the metal shaft &mdash; at least twenty of them &mdash; and I doubt all those tenants left to move into a permanent home.</p><p>&emsp;The brief pang of fear surprises me, nearly overriding my hunger.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A shame she was drafted,&quot; Derry says, but his face lightens. &quot;But you seem lovely, too. Keep us entertained with stories of your little . . . quests, and we&apos;ll share a little,&quot; he insists.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I can do that,&quot; I manage: tempted, but too timid to ask how many faces they&apos;ve seen before.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s your name, dear?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya. Miss Katiya Breakey,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You have a wonderful day, Miss Katiya,&quot; he says, flashing a toothy smile before handing me a steaming breakfast bun.</p><p>&emsp;The hunger is more persuasive than the urge to clean the mess. I rush through the front door with the delicious bread dissolving between my teeth, and as I turn to set the lock, I catch the sight of a familiar face. </p><p>&emsp;Bertram struggles to bend down and tie his boot. I&apos;m not the only one that&apos;s not used to the armor.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s like the old village all over again,&quot; I shout.</p><p>&emsp;It startles him. He mulls over a response as I approach, struggling harder to tie a simple knot. &quot;Less fire, though. I hope it stays that way.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Speaking of disasters,&quot; I say, &quot;I don&apos;t mind watching you struggle for a while, but are you going to let me help you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Bertram blushes, then nods. I stoop down to tame his laces, laughing at how stiffly he stands on the porch.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You know, you&apos;re supposed to tie them BEFORE you can&apos;t bend over,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I would surely remember if this nagging headache went away. I think I lost part of my mind last night. Say &mdash; where&apos;s double-L? Didn&apos;t you leave with him?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I did.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But he didn&apos;t stay,&quot; he replies.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess not,&quot; I tell him. </p><p>&emsp;He looks like he&apos;s about to add some commentary, but hinges his mouth shut before the insults can fly, settling instead for something else. &quot;Should we walk together?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That sounds great.&quot;</p><p>&emsp; &quot;And maybe every morning?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That sounds even better.&quot;</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;The walk is quick since we already live in the military district, a few blocks from the boundary of the Gaffe Royal Base. We discuss the letters from our families, the identical layout of our houses, our headaches, and reminisce on the few moments of joy we experienced together in the capital.</p><p>&emsp;With my best friend here, I can almost convince myself that it&apos;s all going to be alright, and I relish in the nostalgia of shared memories. The feeling carries all the way until we arrive at the posting board, ready to start on our first day.</p>"

        "<p id=\"1.5.1.1\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The next lucid moment, I find myself pinned upside-down beneath a thick wooden rack. The heat climbs as I drag my heels across the floor, my clothes so black and charred that I pray my sweaty flesh might slick me back through the narrow space. Within the hot box of crackling logs and scalding cinders, the roar of recircling flames makes the house screech in agony when its bones crunch and crumble, casting twigs and thatch to the ashen floor.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.1.2\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The twisting and thrashing gets me nowhere, but when a log column crashes into the thin floor, the rack slides into the hollow foundation. My body is so small and pathetic, but I&apos;m barely able to command my cramped muscles to escape, crawling across the floor as the smoke billows overhead, drawing shallow, stinging breaths into  my pinched lungs. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.1.3\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The log walls close in like long fingers of a burning fist that clenches, casting glowing rubies of raging ruin that spread like a rash across the cabin&apos;s bones, and as I gasp harder for desperate breaths, losing the strength of air to drive my muscles, I realize that all the windows and doors are missing.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.1.4\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The heat would evaporate my tears if I had the fluids left to cry. All that&apos;s left is to feel how much I loathe this feeling of helplessness. Didn&apos;t I escape this crumbling crypt of cinders? Or was the full life I led after just a dream of a dying mind, denying its demise? Didn&apos;t Stella and Erik and Bertram treat my burns as we sought solitude on the outskirts of Northaven? Or is this the last memory of my soul in the Reservoir, preparing to be reborn?</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.1.5\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But this body is so weak and useless, and I lust so strongly for power, for Essence: Essence that might let me bend steel; to bash through the walls; to crush the skulls of the arsonists. I only wish I could live to return the favor, to get revenge for that fading image of their faces.</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.5.2.1\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;It takes a couple seconds before my mind is able to catch up on two decades of living history. It&apos;s not the first time my mind tormented me with visions of another life, one where the Gods of fortune hadn&apos;t intervened. My episodes were worse in the Barracks: so bad that they threw me in with all the other traumatized children of the war that tossed and turned too much in their sleep, waking the others with the foreshadowing shouts and screams of the slaughter that might await them.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.2.2\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I always think I can be stronger. I always find myself thinking I can outmaneuver it, but it matters not how viciously I fight to comport myself. That poisonous malady of the soul is an everflowing source of suffering stronger than the sea. And even as I sit here with full recollection of everything that&apos;s brought me to this moment, I still can&apos;t shake that feeling of eternal freefall, that uncomfortable feathering in my stomach that casts my fingers and toes in phantom static, waiting and waiting for when I&apos;ll splatter against the end of this bottomless pit.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.2.3\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But the end never comes. The only way, it seems, is to distract myself from the infinite fall, so that feeling becomes a lesser part of me. I&apos;ve tried hating it, but it never concedes. I&apos;ve tried overpowering it, but it&apos;s like sculpting water. So all I can do is follow the words of my father when these episodes would overtake me.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.2.4\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Katiya, he would say. My beautiful daughter, you have to focus. Tell me, where are you right now?</p>",

My other hand reaches for the left side of the bed as I call out his name, longing for a touch beyond lust, but the bed is cold again: damp with his sweat from our passions the night before.</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.5.2.10\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;It&apos;s the hundred-and-twenty-ninth year after the Fall. A long winter fades into spring as the world opens again, and I can smell the buds of flowers blooming in the wild spaces. &quot;I&apos;ve come back to find something I lost, I think,&quot; I add.</p>",

My heart is acclimating to the stillness, and my body is accepting there&apos;s nothing that threatens it, even though I&apos;ve already identified all the exits. I must have flamed a little in my sleep: there are small burn holes where my naked body pressed hardest against the fabric. The sheets are saturated with soot from the scalding heat my circuits must have risen, but that&apos;s not what upsets me the most. As the world returns to me, I can feel my fists ball on a different kind of anger.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.2.13\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I thought the passion of the night before might have compelled Jullian him to stay. The feeling of that truth feels so palpable when he kisses me, and for the hour after, my mind floats on the joy of all we&apos;ve shared: watching each other&apos;s siblings; studying those long nights together; even training in the early mornings; and all the time we&apos;d set aside for each other despite everything.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.2.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Maybe it&apos;s the annoyed sigh he breathes when I goad him on the morning runs around the village, one of our traditions. Or maybe it&apos;s in the listless tick he acquired any time we walk about the village. Or maybe it&apos;s in his new group of friends &mdash; though he&apos;s always longed for a group to belong to, and I don&apos;t fault him for any of that.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.2.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But he wasn&apos;t here when I needed him. The only considerate act was topping off the Essence switch with a touch, allowing the ceiling fan enough energy to run until I awoke. His clothes vanished as if he was trying to clear a crime scene.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.2.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;After I release myself from the tangle of bedsheets, I  poke my head out the back window facing west &mdash; nearly forgetting to cover my breasts with the thick red curtain as I try to guess the time. It&apos;s a commerce street,  and the stalls are vacant without produce or trinkets, the stools still tucked beneath the counters. The merchants tend to gather an hour after sunrise, meaning it&apos;s long before the time that we were told to gather outside the officer post.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.2.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I glance out the east window that looks out upon a quaint little garden: my tiny lawn with a walkway that divides it, enclosed by the spires of a wrought-iron fence. The mountain air is so crisp and fresh as it pours though the windows, wrapping around the curtain that covers my extremities, and when I lift my eyes to the Purgatory Mountains, feeling the morning sun radiate my skin, I find a captivating view of Lake Gaffesend.</p>",

The underwear is the only thing that&apos;s distinctly feminine, and after smelling myself to ensure the stench of sweat is not severe, I slip on a pair, and proceed to dress in the Royal Guard&apos;s underclothes.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.2.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The white undershirt is baggy, but not too long in the sleeves. I&apos;m just relieved to not have to wear the same binder I wore for graduation.

        "<p id=\"1.5.3.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m Derry. And this is my wife, Carmen. We sell fresh bread here every morning.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.27\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I shake their hands, bending awkwardly to meet their eyes from four feet off of street level.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.28\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;The last girl preferred waking to the smell of fresh bread,&quot; Carmen says. &quot;She regaled us with tales of her travels in exchange for a loaf. Maybe you can do the same?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.29\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My peckishness speaks first. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.30\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Of course. What do I owe you?&quot; I ask, drawing my fingers into my coin purse for a couple Kine.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;The first one&apos;s free, because I think you&apos;ll make a great customer. It&apos;s fresh, with a special blend of spices in there,&quot; he insists.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.32\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;His wife turns from unloading the cart. &quot;Say, what happened to the other girl?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.33\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp; I withdraw the key from my pocket: without the cover of night or blurred vision, I can inspect it a lot easier. The surface is rough where her name was ground away. I can see the shape of her letters interspersed between mine. It&apos;s been sanded enough that I&apos;m sure she&apos;s not the first: it&apos;s evident that the names of cadets were stacked and scratched nearly halfway through the metal shaft &mdash; at least twenty of them &mdash; and I doubt all those tenants left to move into a permanent home.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.34\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The brief pang of fear surprises me, nearly overriding my hunger.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.35\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;A shame she was drafted,&quot; Derry says, but his face lightens. &quot;But you seem lovely, too. Keep us entertained with stories of your little . . . quests, and we&apos;ll share a little,&quot; he insists.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.36\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I can do that,&quot; I manage: tempted, but too timid to ask how many faces they&apos;ve seen before.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.37\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s your name, dear?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.38\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Katiya. Miss Katiya Breakey,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.39\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You have a wonderful day, Miss Katiya,&quot; he says, flashing a toothy smile before handing me a steaming breakfast bun.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.40\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The hunger is more persuasive than the urge to clean the mess. I rush through the front door with the delicious bread dissolving between my teeth, and as I turn to set the lock, I catch the sight of a familiar face. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.41\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Bertram struggles to bend down and tie his boot. I&apos;m not the only one that&apos;s not used to the armor.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.42\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s like the old village all over again,&quot; I shout.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.43\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;It startles him. He mulls over a response as I approach, struggling harder to tie a simple knot. &quot;Less fire, though. I hope it stays that way.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.44\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Speaking of disasters,&quot; I say, &quot;I don&apos;t mind watching you struggle for a while, but are you going to let me help you?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.45\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Bertram blushes, then nods. I stoop down to tame his laces, laughing at how stiffly he stands on the porch.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.46\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You know, you&apos;re supposed to tie them BEFORE you can&apos;t bend over,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.47\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I would surely remember if this nagging headache went away. I think I lost part of my mind last night. Say &mdash; where&apos;s double-L? Didn&apos;t you leave with him?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.48\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I did.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.49\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But he didn&apos;t stay,&quot; he replies.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.50\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I guess not,&quot; I tell him. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.51\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He looks like he&apos;s about to add some commentary, but hinges his mouth shut before the insults can fly, settling instead for something else. &quot;Should we walk together?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.52\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;That sounds great.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.5.3.53\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp; &quot;And maybe every morning?&quot;</p>",

      "<p>&emsp;&quot;Since you started on your first day, you haven&apos;t been drug tested. What&apos;s gonna change their mind on Monday, bro? My work never runs drug tests,&quot; he says. Gunfire cracks over the TV, flashing the empty walls with pops of color.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No shit, Miguel. Their corporate structure banks on baked box-boys like you. The ones that forget they&apos;re lifting crates and stocking shelves and selling printers for eight hours a day.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s manager Miguel now &mdash; I order the little guys to do it. I&apos;m a number-puncher like you now,&quot; He brags. &quot;Oh. But except I&apos;m actually good enough to get promoted.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The words hit at the same time as a round-ending enemy airstrike. The bombs collapse my soldier to the dirt as the word DEFEAT brandishes across the screens, reassuring us that &quot;we&apos;ll get them next time.&quot; But his quips hurt no more than the vibrations in the controller.</p><p>&emsp; Miguel cracks another lukewarm beer, kicking the box of the remaining 27 over to me. I put down my custom controller.</p><p>&emsp; &quot;I get bringing over a six-pack of some IPA, maybe a 12-pack of Coors or something, but thirty?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He manages a straight face as his brown eyes pierce mine, wiping the suds from his scruffy lip rug. &quot;You know, Jesus was wrong when he said &apos;man can&apos;t live on bread alone.&apos; He didn&apos;t know you could drink it yet.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Is that right?&quot; I laugh.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;ve been rolling around the back of my car for a couple weeks after going to Katy&apos;s house. You know, high school Katy?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No?&quot;</p><p>&emsp; &quot;The pregnancy scare one, with the nice&mdash;.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, no &mdash; I remember,&quot; I say. Her face flashes in my mind from our junior prom group. Miguel took her while I took Kei.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I took her friend home and stole the thirty-rack since no one touched it. Those guys are all fuckin&apos; hipsters, man, so far up their ass about IPA&apos;s and stuff, they won&apos;t drink just to get drunk anymore.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Coming from the guy who doesn&apos;t smoke just to get high,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Passionate stoners are worse than drinkers. You couldn&apos;t be any more uninteresting when you&apos;re talking about &apos;Sour Dee&apos; or whatever,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Fuck off.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He burps. I crack another warm one, and when the timer on the pre-game lobby counts to zero, I lift my controller again. But he hits me with something that isn&apos;t just a snide comeback.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do you miss high school?&quot; He asks.</p><p>&emsp;It takes me a moment to think. I haven&apos;t really considered it, though I&apos;ve noticed myself staying away from those places we hung out between classes and after school. Those places have some gravity I&apos;m afraid will get me sucked into that past, when I&apos;ve worked so hard to put those good times behind me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I dunno. It&apos;s like a friend you haven&apos;t seen in a while. Nice to visit every once in a while and relish in the past. But it&apos;s best for both of us if we move on, you know?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;He drops the controller into his lap. My thumbs dig into the sticks when I climb a ladder for a sniper nest, only to get blasted off by a camper.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You trying to say something?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, dude,&quot; I start. &quot;I&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You can use that losing take on Kei or Kylie all you want, but on your friend?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, of course not! No, man. You&apos;re my best friend. You-&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m messing with you, fucker,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;He laughs, swigging the rest of his beer between deaths.</p><p>&emsp;He says, &quot;I do. I mean, a part of me does. I hated high school until the end of junior year when our group really started to hang out. It&apos;s like, I never felt like I was a part of something until then. And . . . I don&apos;t know if I really felt it since.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I wonder what the others are up to,&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Kayla&apos;s having her second kid already. Another girl, I think. Her and Johnny Boy are still together.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I was surprised. Getting married half a year after high school? I didn&apos;t think they&apos;d make it this far.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You never went to their wedding, though.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I was in college halfway across the country, bud,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about Kei?&quot; He asks. &quot;You were trying to get with her for a while, but you never had the cajones to do it before she graduated after our junior year.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve told you before,&quot; I say. &quot;She&apos;s at my work.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No shit!&quot; He laughs. &quot;Puta madre, the yellow thirst was real for you, man.&quot; He cracks another can after getting mowed down by an LMG. &quot;Are you gonna shoot your shot? You told me you got some experience in college, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. But I don&apos;t know...&quot; none of those nights in college really fulfilled me. I was always missing something. &quot;I&apos;m not into the clubbing scene like you are.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;All you have to do is ask! It&apos;s not like high school. Alcohol changes things. The fellas I met in college showed me all around the city. I know that shit like the front of my hand!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Back. The back of your hand,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Whatever. But we need to get you laid, now that you got this fine house. Shit, man, I wish I could afford something like this. People our age probably never will.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you still live here in Hearthland Ridge,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Paying for a studio! Like living in a fuckin&apos; box for seventeen hundred a month,&quot; he says. &quot;Walls so paper-thin I can hear everything. I&apos;d rather go out and get some pussy than cuck myself to the soundtrack of someone else getting it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh, sure,&quot; I say &mdash; sometimes I wonder if he tries to fit as many of those words as he can into a sentence. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;But really. I&apos;m proud of you, man,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Really. You&apos;ve worked hard and you&apos;ve made it. When I was trying to work my way through our senior class, you were grinding at math and shit. You have an actual chance to get wifed up. It&apos;s not in my blood.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I don&apos;t want to. I like the chase better,  you know. Settling down? That&apos;s like giving up. What do you do, then? With that feeling, you know, when you have a couple rats with some chick and you know you&apos;re locked in for the next forever?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The feeling&apos;s all I&apos;ve been able to think about since I got back here. No more regimentation. No convenient road map of class to class to graduation: now it&apos;s all just open-ended.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But, like, nothing against you if you&apos;re into that. Having rats can be dope. They mow your lawn and shit.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Someday. Maybe. I&apos;m just too boring, I think,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Boring? You were the heart of our group back then, dude. You brought us together. You&apos;re good at that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But nothing&apos;s forcing any of us to be together anymore,&quot; I say. &quot;Look at how many have moved away from here. It&apos;s just you and me now, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Kayla and John are in California. Michael went to Kansas. He likes flat woman, so I guess he wants a state that can get him off just by driving on the roads.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The beer comes up my nose. I drop the controller and the batteries pop out. &quot;Ugh. Fuck, man,&quot; I say, balancing the pain of carbonation in my nose with the urge to laugh, imagining Mike trying to stick his wiener in a Kansas anthill.</p><p>&emsp;Miguel says, &quot;Maybe we&apos;ll be stuck here forever. But hey, as long as we&apos;re both here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just wish . . .&quot; I start to say, but instead, I reach down and pop the batteries back in the controller.</p><p>&emsp;He slicks his hair back again, finishing another one. &quot;Is it cool if I crash here? I mean, I can drive high, but not drunk.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure, man. But I don&apos;t have a cot or a sleeping bag or anything.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please. I&apos;ve slept on floors my whole adult life!&quot; He gestures to the box with 23 stones left. &quot;Now are you gonna help me finish all of them?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;All of them?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;All of them,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s Friday. I know we&apos;re old and shit now, but stay awake a little longer, like we&apos;re twelve and it&apos;s a sleepover in your parents&apos; basement, and I&apos;ll tell you a bedtime story.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, great. About what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;One time I was playing on your Xbox when you were out of town. When you had me pet-sitting, and...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll pass. But&mdash;&quot; I think, as long as I&apos;m not drinking alone, it can&apos;t hurt. What&apos;s the worst that can happen?</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;&quot;No, I get what you&apos;re saying, but what do you mean?&quot; Miguel says, slurring his words as he melts into the futon: the only piece of furniture our drunk asses could assemble. The overturned boxes are makeshift tables that keep the cans off the floor, since we&apos;re feeling too lazy to dig for a trash bag.</p><p>&emsp;I lift the can to my lips, but I don&apos;t let the poison pass the threshold. Past experience tells me that I&apos;m toeing my limit: lost enough to let my stupid emotions leak on my face, to conjure words to try to push them down, but not enough to kneel at the porcelain throne. I know the feeling is real because the wetness on my face gives it credence, and I often think he&apos;s the only friend I&apos;ve got left to listen.</p><p>&emsp;If only I could get him to.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How can you get it if you don&apos;t know what I mean?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I get it, bro, just not what you mean.&quot; Miguel lifts the cracked smartphone above his face as he lays on the futon, thumb-scrolling through an endless barrage of ads and entertainment. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What I mean is that I don&apos;t feel it anymore. My life is just work, then sleep, then work, then go to sleep, but it&apos;s nothing more than that. I don&apos;t have it like you do. You always have the energy, but I don&apos;t know how you find it.&quot; The tears leak further: I can&apos;t remember the last time I was drunk enough to let them out. &quot;But I know the time is in between there somewhere, I mean, I&apos;m certain I could fit in anything if I tried. But I&apos;m always just so damn tired.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He swipes right a couple times in a dating app, still refusing to look up. &quot;Time isn&apos;t the only thing that&apos;s too small of yours to fit.&quot; He laughs. Then the vibration from a match startles him. </p><p>&emsp;Miguel&apos;s thumb slips and he flings his phone in the air, letting out a grunt when it crashes into his nose.He jolts upright to rub the pain out, looking at me for the first time in an hour.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, shit. You&apos;re serious.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, you think this is just a bit?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, of course not.&quot; He sets his phone on a cardboard box and thinks for a moment. &quot;Why I &apos;feel it.&apos; I don&apos;t know . . . I guess I just got a big family that always keeps me busy. My cousins are young, and my siblings are still in college, so I end up going to their parties and stuff.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So it&apos;s like college never ended for you. Never realized I&apos;d miss it so much . . . my roommates made the damn experience,&quot; I say. It didn&apos;t matter if we were in the dorms or slumming it in an expensive renter-fixer-upper west of campus: those fuckers forced me to get out. &quot;Most nights, when I was studying in my bedroom, nose stuck in a textbook, they&apos;d pick the lock and barge in &mdash; shooting me with flaming Nerf darts, assaulting me with a pizza cutter, or dragging me to one of their parties.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He takes the last swig of his seventh can. &quot;Just like my older cousins. They show up to my house to drag me clubbing, even if I pulled a &apos;tenner&apos; at work.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Man. If my brother was still around, I&apos;m sure he&apos;d be over here all the time,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course. Our families had a lot of fun together: barbeques, parties at the park...&quot; The list trails off when he crunches the can in his hands.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You remember those weekends in middle school when we tried to beat the Halo campaign in a single night?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. And your brother would buy all those energy drinks, sneaking them downstairs for us,&quot; he says. &quot;Oh, and the summer tent sleepovers, remember that one night you were so scared of the lightning you couldn&apos;t move, and my dad had to carry you back inside?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I was stuck in the sleeping bag, so soaking wet from the rain I almost slid out of his arms,&quot; I say. We share a laugh. &quot;Or the RV trip we took for the out-of-state Lacrosse game&mdash;when we got stuck on the side of the road. We used up all the power playing GameCube and my dad was furious!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He laughs. &quot;Yeah. And we had to ask one of the families running behind to pick us up. The whole time we waited there, your dad was screaming at Triple-A, and your mom was trying to cook, but the RV tipped so far to the side that she couldn&apos;t set anything on the counter...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;...And all we could do was just pass the ball on the side of the road, wondering whether or not we were gonna make the game.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But we won that one, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah &mdash; I ripped the game-winning corner pocket.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh yeah. Their team was trash. The goalie scored on himself.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The nostalgia can only abate the emptiness for so long. I take another swig, feeling the body high mix with the dizziness from the flat beer. Without them, the next words might not have left me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But now it&apos;s just like . . . I dunno. I only know that it sucks, you know?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like, I&apos;m trying to care, but I don&apos;t. My mind doesn&apos;t want me to be happy.&quot; I nearly fall out of the folding chair when I&apos;m talking with my arms. &quot;We&apos;re not forced to get out there anymore. To meet new people, to keep friendships alive. All our friends are getting married or serious while we&apos;re just left behind. My parents nag me about it all the time: getting impatient since I&apos;m the only one left that&apos;ll keep the family name going. And&mdash;&quot;&quot;That shit doesn&apos;t matter. That&apos;s not what it&apos;s about,&quot; Miguel says. &quot;You just gotta do, man. You gotta do things just to do them.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I furrow my brows. &quot;To do what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He wets his lips on a last sip before he tries at something profound.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The doing is what makes happiness come, when even . . . even when you&apos;re, like, not happy, and shit, you force yourself to do things, so happy shit can happen more often and shit, so you can have the chance to enjoy it,&quot; he insists. </p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m lost without words, so he decides to muddy the waters even further.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You get the gist of what I&apos;m saying? Like, you have to decide to do no matter what. Like even when you don&apos;t feel like it, you know, you do. The doing, I mean, is something you choose which gives a chance of something good. Or something, at least. You know?&quot;I feel like I just had a seizure. &quot;What the fuck does that even mean?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know, man. Maybe I&apos;m bad at . . . no, maybe you suck at listening,&quot; he says. &quot;I said that shit perfectly.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I mutter to myself, trying to piece together what he said. It takes me a couple seconds. &quot;Force yourself to engage with the world. Give happiness its best chance to come out, because it&apos;s all you can do.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s exactly what I said!&quot; He snatches another can, using the light of the TV to inspect all the dents from rolling around in his Corolla.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like hell you did!&quot; I roll my eyes.</p><p>&emsp;His verbal seizure must have made him tired. He puts the can down instead of cracking another one, and after a long yawn, he pulls the unzipped sleeping bag off the floor and wraps it around himself on the futon.&quot;That thing goes down flat, you know,&quot; I offer. &quot;It doesn&apos;t have to be a couch.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Too much effort. I&apos;ve slept on worse,&quot; he says. &quot;I gotta get to sleep so I can make it to church tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And show up hungover? I doubt you&apos;ll make it through the service,&quot; I say. &quot;But, hey, if you stay a while after, I&apos;m sure you could catch the double-A meeting.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He&apos;s too tired for a clap-back. He&apos;s not even scrolling his phone anymore: just sprawled there with his feet dangling over the wobbly armrest, arms tucked beneath him, his face buried into a folded towel.</p><p>&emsp;I glance at the stove. &quot;It&apos;s only like 12:30.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Long day . . . leading idiots . . . feels so late,&quot; he says, turning to bury his face in the leather crevice of the couch.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So much for an all-nighter, huh?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nnnn,&quot; he mumbles into the towel. &quot;Guessn&apos;t.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess we&apos;re not young anymore,&quot; I say. &quot;We didn&apos;t even make it through half the rack.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nn.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So are we gonna finish these?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;No answer.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I said...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;But then I give up.</p>"

My work never runs drug tests,&quot; he says. Gunfire cracks over the TV, flashing the empty walls with pops of color.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.2\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No shit, Miguel. Their corporate structure banks on baked box-boys like you. The ones that forget they&apos;re lifting crates and stocking shelves and selling printers for eight hours a day.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.3\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s manager Miguel now &mdash; I order the little guys to do it. I&apos;m a number-puncher like you now,&quot; He brags. &quot;Oh. But except I&apos;m actually good enough to get promoted.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.4\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The words hit at the same time as a round-ending enemy airstrike. The bombs collapse my soldier to the dirt as the word DEFEAT brandishes across the screens, reassuring us that &quot;we&apos;ll get them next time.&quot; But his quips hurt no more than the vibrations in the controller.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.5\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp; Miguel cracks another lukewarm beer, kicking the box of the remaining 27 over to me. I put down my custom controller.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.6\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp; &quot;I get bringing over a six-pack of some IPA, maybe a 12-pack of Coors or something, but thirty?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.7\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He manages a straight face as his brown eyes pierce mine, wiping the suds from his scruffy lip rug. &quot;You know, Jesus was wrong when he said &apos;man can&apos;t live on bread alone.&apos; He didn&apos;t know you could drink it yet.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.8\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Is that right?&quot; I laugh.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.9\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;They&apos;ve been rolling around the back of my car for a couple weeks after going to Katy&apos;s house. You know, high school Katy?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.10\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.11\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp; &quot;The pregnancy scare one, with the nice&mdash;.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah, no &mdash; I remember,&quot; I say. Her face flashes in my mind from our junior prom group. Miguel took her while I took Kei.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Well, I took her friend home and stole the thirty-rack since no one touched it. Those guys are all fuckin&apos; hipsters, man, so far up their ass about IPA&apos;s and stuff, they won&apos;t drink just to get drunk anymore.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Coming from the guy who doesn&apos;t smoke just to get high,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Passionate stoners are worse than drinkers. You couldn&apos;t be any more uninteresting when you&apos;re talking about &apos;Sour Dee&apos; or whatever,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Fuck off.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He burps. I crack another warm one, and when the timer on the pre-game lobby counts to zero, I lift my controller again. But he hits me with something that isn&apos;t just a snide comeback.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Do you miss high school?&quot; He asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;It takes me a moment to think. I haven&apos;t really considered it, though I&apos;ve noticed myself staying away from those places we hung out between classes and after school. Those places have some gravity I&apos;m afraid will get me sucked into that past, when I&apos;ve worked so hard to put those good times behind me.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I dunno. It&apos;s like a friend you haven&apos;t seen in a while. Nice to visit every once in a while and relish in the past. But it&apos;s best for both of us if we move on, you know?&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He drops the controller into his lap. My thumbs dig into the sticks when I climb a ladder for a sniper nest, only to get blasted off by a camper.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You trying to say something?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No, dude,&quot; I start. &quot;I&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.23\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You can use that losing take on Kei or Kylie all you want, but on your friend?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No, of course not! No, man. You&apos;re my best friend. You-&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m messing with you, fucker,&quot; he says. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He laughs, swigging the rest of his beer between deaths.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He says, &quot;I do. I mean, a part of me does. I hated high school until the end of junior year when our group really started to hang out. It&apos;s like, I never felt like I was a part of something until then. And . . . I don&apos;t know if I really felt it since.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I wonder what the others are up to,&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Kayla&apos;s having her second kid already. Another girl, I think. Her and Johnny Boy are still together.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I was surprised. Getting married half a year after high school? I didn&apos;t think they&apos;d make it this far.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You never went to their wedding, though.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I was in college halfway across the country, bud,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;How about Kei?&quot; He asks. &quot;You were trying to get with her for a while, but you never had the cajones to do it before she graduated after our junior year.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.34\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve told you before,&quot; I say. &quot;She&apos;s at my work.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.35\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No shit!&quot; He laughs. &quot;Puta madre, the yellow thirst was real for you, man.&quot; He cracks another can after getting mowed down by an LMG. &quot;Are you gonna shoot your shot? You told me you got some experience in college, right?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.36\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah. But I don&apos;t know...&quot; none of those nights in college really fulfilled me. I was always missing something. &quot;I&apos;m not into the clubbing scene like you are.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.37\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;All you have to do is ask! It&apos;s not like high school. Alcohol changes things. The fellas I met in college showed me all around the city. I know that shit like the front of my hand!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.38\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Back. The back of your hand,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.39\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Whatever. But we need to get you laid, now that you got this fine house. Shit, man, I wish I could afford something like this. People our age probably never will.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.40\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But you still live here in Hearthland Ridge,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.41\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Paying for a studio! Like living in a fuckin&apos; box for seventeen hundred a month,&quot; he says. &quot;Walls so paper-thin I can hear everything. I&apos;d rather go out and get some pussy than cuck myself to the soundtrack of someone else getting it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.42\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Uh, sure,&quot; I say &mdash; sometimes I wonder if he tries to fit as many of those words as he can into a sentence. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.43\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But really. I&apos;m proud of you, man,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Really. You&apos;ve worked hard and you&apos;ve made it. When I was trying to work my way through our senior class, you were grinding at math and shit. You have an actual chance to get wifed up. It&apos;s not in my blood.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.44\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.45\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Well, I don&apos;t want to. I like the chase better,  you know. Settling down? That&apos;s like giving up. What do you do, then? With that feeling, you know, when you have a couple rats with some chick and you know you&apos;re locked in for the next forever?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.46\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The feeling&apos;s all I&apos;ve been able to think about since I got back here. No more regimentation. No convenient road map of class to class to graduation: now it&apos;s all just open-ended.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.47\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But, like, nothing against you if you&apos;re into that. Having rats can be dope. They mow your lawn and shit.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.48\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Someday. Maybe. I&apos;m just too boring, I think,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.49\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Boring? You were the heart of our group back then, dude. You brought us together. You&apos;re good at that.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.50\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But nothing&apos;s forcing any of us to be together anymore,&quot; I say. &quot;Look at how many have moved away from here. It&apos;s just you and me now, right?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.51\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Kayla and John are in California. Michael went to Kansas. He likes flat woman, so I guess he wants a state that can get him off just by driving on the roads.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.52\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The beer comes up my nose. I drop the controller and the batteries pop out. &quot;Ugh. Fuck, man,&quot; I say, balancing the pain of carbonation in my nose with the urge to laugh, imagining Mike trying to stick his wiener in a Kansas anthill.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.53\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Miguel says, &quot;Maybe we&apos;ll be stuck here forever. But hey, as long as we&apos;re both here.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.54\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I just wish . . .&quot; I start to say, but instead, I reach down and pop the batteries back in the controller.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.55\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He slicks his hair back again, finishing another one. &quot;Is it cool if I crash here? I mean, I can drive high, but not drunk.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.56\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Sure, man. But I don&apos;t have a cot or a sleeping bag or anything.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.57\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Please. I&apos;ve slept on floors my whole adult life!&quot; He gestures to the box with 23 stones left. &quot;Now are you gonna help me finish all of them?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.58\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;All of them?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.59\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;All of them,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s Friday. I know we&apos;re old and shit now, but stay awake a little longer, like we&apos;re twelve and it&apos;s a sleepover in your parents&apos; basement, and I&apos;ll tell you a bedtime story.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.60\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh, great. About what?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.61\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;One time I was playing on your Xbox when you were out of town. When you had me pet-sitting, and...&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.1.62\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll pass. But&mdash;&quot; I think, as long as I&apos;m not drinking alone, it can&apos;t hurt. What&apos;s the worst that can happen?</p>"
      ],
      [
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.1\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No, I get what you&apos;re saying, but what do you mean?&quot; Miguel says, slurring his words as he melts into the futon: the only piece of furniture our drunk asses could assemble. The overturned boxes are makeshift tables that keep the cans off the floor, since we&apos;re feeling too lazy to dig for a trash bag.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.2\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I lift the can to my lips, but I don&apos;t let the poison pass the threshold. Past experience tells me that I&apos;m toeing my limit: lost enough to let my stupid emotions leak on my face, to conjure words to try to push them down, but not enough to kneel at the porcelain throne. I know the feeling is real because the wetness on my face gives it credence, and I often think he&apos;s the only friend I&apos;ve got left to listen.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.3\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;If only I could get him to.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.4\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;How can you get it if you don&apos;t know what I mean?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.5\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I get it, bro, just not what you mean.&quot; Miguel lifts the cracked smartphone above his face as he lays on the futon, thumb-scrolling through an endless barrage of ads and entertainment. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.6\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;What I mean is that I don&apos;t feel it anymore. My life is just work, then sleep, then work, then go to sleep, but it&apos;s nothing more than that. I don&apos;t have it like you do. You always have the energy, but I don&apos;t know how you find it.&quot; The tears leak further: I can&apos;t remember the last time I was drunk enough to let them out. &quot;But I know the time is in between there somewhere, I mean, I&apos;m certain I could fit in anything if I tried. But I&apos;m always just so damn tired.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.7\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He swipes right a couple times in a dating app, still refusing to look up. &quot;Time isn&apos;t the only thing that&apos;s too small of yours to fit.&quot; He laughs. Then the vibration from a match startles him. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.8\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Miguel&apos;s thumb slips and he flings his phone in the air, letting out a grunt when it crashes into his nose.He jolts upright to rub the pain out, looking at me for the first time in an hour.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.9\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh, shit. You&apos;re serious.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.10\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah, you think this is just a bit?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.11\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No, of course not.&quot; He sets his phone on a cardboard box and thinks for a moment. &quot;Why I &apos;feel it.&apos; I don&apos;t know . . . I guess I just got a big family that always keeps me busy. My cousins are young, and my siblings are still in college, so I end up going to their parties and stuff.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;So it&apos;s like college never ended for you. Never realized I&apos;d miss it so much . . . my roommates made the damn experience,&quot; I say. It didn&apos;t matter if we were in the dorms or slumming it in an expensive renter-fixer-upper west of campus: those fuckers forced me to get out. &quot;Most nights, when I was studying in my bedroom, nose stuck in a textbook, they&apos;d pick the lock and barge in &mdash; shooting me with flaming Nerf darts, assaulting me with a pizza cutter, or dragging me to one of their parties.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He takes the last swig of his seventh can. &quot;Just like my older cousins. They show up to my house to drag me clubbing, even if I pulled a &apos;tenner&apos; at work.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Man. If my brother was still around, I&apos;m sure he&apos;d be over here all the time,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Of course. Our families had a lot of fun together: barbeques, parties at the park...&quot; The list trails off when he crunches the can in his hands.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You remember those weekends in middle school when we tried to beat the Halo campaign in a single night?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah. And your brother would buy all those energy drinks, sneaking them downstairs for us,&quot; he says. &quot;Oh, and the summer tent sleepovers, remember that one night you were so scared of the lightning you couldn&apos;t move, and my dad had to carry you back inside?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I was stuck in the sleeping bag, so soaking wet from the rain I almost slid out of his arms,&quot; I say. We share a laugh. &quot;Or the RV trip we took for the out-of-state Lacrosse game&mdash;when we got stuck on the side of the road. We used up all the power playing GameCube and my dad was furious!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He laughs. &quot;Yeah. And we had to ask one of the families running behind to pick us up. The whole time we waited there, your dad was screaming at Triple-A, and your mom was trying to cook, but the RV tipped so far to the side that she couldn&apos;t set anything on the counter...&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;...And all we could do was just pass the ball on the side of the road, wondering whether or not we were gonna make the game.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But we won that one, right?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah &mdash; I ripped the game-winning corner pocket.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.23\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh yeah. Their team was trash. The goalie scored on himself.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The nostalgia can only abate the emptiness for so long. I take another swig, feeling the body high mix with the dizziness from the flat beer. Without them, the next words might not have left me.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But now it&apos;s just like . . . I dunno. I only know that it sucks, you know?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Like, I&apos;m trying to care, but I don&apos;t. My mind doesn&apos;t want me to be happy.&quot; I nearly fall out of the folding chair when I&apos;m talking with my arms. &quot;We&apos;re not forced to get out there anymore. To meet new people, to keep friendships alive. All our friends are getting married or serious while we&apos;re just left behind. My parents nag me about it all the time: getting impatient since I&apos;m the only one left that&apos;ll keep the family name going. And&mdash;&quot;&quot;That shit doesn&apos;t matter. That&apos;s not what it&apos;s about,&quot; Miguel says. &quot;You just gotta do, man. You gotta do things just to do them.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I furrow my brows. &quot;To do what?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He wets his lips on a last sip before he tries at something profound.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;The doing is what makes happiness come, when even . . . even when you&apos;re, like, not happy, and shit, you force yourself to do things, so happy shit can happen more often and shit, so you can have the chance to enjoy it,&quot; he insists. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I&apos;m lost without words, so he decides to muddy the waters even further.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You get the gist of what I&apos;m saying? Like, you have to decide to do no matter what. Like even when you don&apos;t feel like it, you know, you do. The doing, I mean, is something you choose which gives a chance of something good. Or something, at least. You know?&quot;I feel like I just had a seizure. &quot;What the fuck does that even mean?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know, man. Maybe I&apos;m bad at . . . no, maybe you suck at listening,&quot; he says. &quot;I said that shit perfectly.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.34\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I mutter to myself, trying to piece together what he said. It takes me a couple seconds. &quot;Force yourself to engage with the world. Give happiness its best chance to come out, because it&apos;s all you can do.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.35\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s exactly what I said!&quot; He snatches another can, using the light of the TV to inspect all the dents from rolling around in his Corolla.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.36\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Like hell you did!&quot; I roll my eyes.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.37\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;His verbal seizure must have made him tired. He puts the can down instead of cracking another one, and after a long yawn, he pulls the unzipped sleeping bag off the floor and wraps it around himself on the futon.&quot;That thing goes down flat, you know,&quot; I offer. &quot;It doesn&apos;t have to be a couch.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.38\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Too much effort. I&apos;ve slept on worse,&quot; he says. &quot;I gotta get to sleep so I can make it to church tomorrow.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.39\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;And show up hungover? I doubt you&apos;ll make it through the service,&quot; I say. &quot;But, hey, if you stay a while after, I&apos;m sure you could catch the double-A meeting.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.40\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He&apos;s too tired for a clap-back. He&apos;s not even scrolling his phone anymore: just sprawled there with his feet dangling over the wobbly armrest, arms tucked beneath him, his face buried into a folded towel.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.41\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I glance at the stove. &quot;It&apos;s only like 12:30.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.42\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Long day . . . leading idiots . . . feels so late,&quot; he says, turning to bury his face in the leather crevice of the couch.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.43\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;So much for an all-nighter, huh?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.44\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Nnnn,&quot; he mumbles into the towel. &quot;Guessn&apos;t.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.6.2.45\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I guess we&apos;re not young anymore,&quot; I say. &quot;We didn&apos;t even make it through half the rack.&quot;</p>",

      "<p>&emsp;&quot;Is that as bad as it gets? Or is this just because it&apos;s the first day?&quot; Pax asks. &quot;Maybe Aldrin wasn&apos;t lying. I thought we&apos;d be at the enemy&apos;s doorstep most days, waiting for one of them to break through.&quot; He chows down on a raw potato that he withdraws from his pocket, spitting scraps with every syllable. &quot;But this is great &mdash; a little work for as much produce as you can eat!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;As long as you don&apos;t get caught, you idiot,&quot; Ryder says.</p><p>&emsp;The two hike behind us as the sky shifts to dusk, eclipsing all the light from the setting sun. I can feel slivers of potato catching in my hair. Bertram and I shiver in their shade as we struggle for footing, stumbling down the switchbacks of the southern foothills. Despite the half-baked ramblings that often get him in trouble, Pax is right this time. There wasn&apos;t a single scouting mission on the board beyond patrolling the town.</p><p>&emsp;Does it really get this easy?</p><p>&emsp;I wait until the switchback slithers east and the trail straightens, catching the fading light on my first quest form. It&apos;s stamped and scribbled with an illiterate farmer&apos;s signature, dirtied from folding by my soil-soaked fingers. Something catches my eye before we turn another corner: a small statement that the guildscribes helped the farmer write, the only part of the form scrawled in coherent letters.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hah, did you see this section?&quot; I ask Bertram. Pax and Ryder look over our heads without bending. &quot;List the concern and how it demands the strength of the Royal Guard&apos;s Knights.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Bertram squints, reading the two words before a laugh seizes his throat. </p><p>&emsp;Ryder reads it instead.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Defending vegetables.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;From what?&quot; Pax asks. &quot;Hungry bellies?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We share a laugh.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;If this is as hard as it gets, then this is a vacation,&quot; Pax says, showing us his large, calloused hands. &quot;I grew up on the outer farmlands of the Capital, working fields from dawn to dusk. Every day I was strapped for time. But this was nothing.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Bertram agrees. &quot;Farming up here is practically a hobby with how that town in the North supplies us. Blackwater, I think? They supply the whole damn capital, but shouldn&apos;t they be covered in frost?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I agree. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Most maps don&apos;t even chart the land north of the Purgatory Mountains,&quot; I say. &quot;It should be a frozen wasteland.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It sure is. I used to live there, up in Blackwater,&quot; Ryder says. It&apos;s probably the first fact he&apos;s volunteered since I met him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No way. I&apos;ve never met someone from up there,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Me neither,&quot; Pax says. &quot;I guess there&apos;s no reason to leave when there&apos;s no chance to starve, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s no reason to leave because you can&apos;t. Not unless you spend your whole life plotting an escape.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The words are enough to halt us.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;An escape?&quot; Bertram asks. &quot;Why would you have to escape? I thought they were part of the empire. Some kind of commune of field-hands and farmers, with enough Essence to keep the climate year-round.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s not enough Essence in all of Fosroth to allow that,&quot; Pax adds. &quot;Trust me. The Capital lands are unworkable in the winter. I couldn&apos;t even use a spade on them before I left. So I can&apos;t even imagine working the lands up there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s because the lands are&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;His words cut off when a crimson glow saturates the northern hills. We&apos;re too slow to shield our eyes when a blinding light flashes from beyond the Purgatory Mountains, as if brought by Ryder&apos;s invocation.</p><p>&emsp;It barely catches our eyes as we descend the southern foothills. Any one of us could have missed it if we blinked at the wrong time. But before we can second-guess this shared experience &mdash; held as a glow in our retinas when we close our eyes &mdash; we find the faintest column of crimson light stretching skyward, like a glowing thread tethering our world of Fosroth to the stars.</p><p>&emsp;It fades like lightning before we have the time to speak its presence. An eerie silence overshadows the town. The wind withdraws with bated breath. The crickets refuse to rub their wings. But to us &mdash; a naive band of knights that only know battle through secondhand stories &mdash; it&apos;s the truest evidence of a war we&apos;ve gotten yet, and it runs my skin with gooseflesh.</p><p>&emsp;Our pace hastens down the treacherous trail. The trembling words fill every inch of impedance that keeps us from an outright sprint.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I thought the war was contained to the east, not the north! How would they even get around that far?&quot; Paxton huffs.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;d be almost impossible for the enemy to take Blackwater,&quot; Ryder says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But the column was red!&quot; Bertram says. &quot;There&apos;s surely a Mask up there that just did something. It might have even been their Divine Wish...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You mean they just jettisoned all their Essence?&quot; I ask. Essence on the order of the Gods breaks the very laws of this world. Only a select few carry the blessing in their blood. But using it all at once comes at the cost of life.</p><p>&emsp;We tap our circuits for Essence, for the strength in our legs to descend faster and faster, predicating the call to Gaffesend Base. The trail ends on the side of the long, wrapping road we tried to cut, and then it&apos;s a dead sprint. </p><p>&emsp;I refuse to be late on the first day. My sickening fear and small size propel me far ahead of the others, drawing on more anxiety than Essence as I tear past the landmarks of our small town. The trail transitions from matted dirt to concrete, to cobblestone, then back to concrete, until I&apos;m rushing along the west edge of the lake in the military district: dragged forward by the weight of the thin breastplate; begged by my burning lungs to stop or else I might collapse into the water.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I pass the threshold of the gate, gasping for breaths as my last sprint dissolves into a jog. It becomes immediately obvious that weren&apos;t the only ones to notice: most of the recruits gather outside the guard post, swarming around the re-purposed adventurers&apos; guild like flies to excrement. </p><p>&emsp;I spot my brother Erik leaning against the doorframe.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s happening?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Some major Essence event.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, we saw it. We were on the southern hills.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I gasp for breath. He hands me his canteen. One long drink later, I find my mouth wet enough to continue.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Should we be afraid?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Afraid? Guards aren&apos;t supposed to be afraid,&quot; he says, staring down at me with our father&apos;s amber eyes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not afraid . . . I meant concerned,&quot; I say. My mind&apos;s too busy redirecting resources to my starving muscles, and I can feel it in the heat of my flushed face.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t think so.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I try to slide past him to get in, but he traps me with his brazen arms. &quot;Relax,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;re going to be fine. You know I wouldn&apos;t let anything happen to you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know that,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You always get so damn worked up. Just breathe,&quot; he demands. &quot;We&apos;re safe here in the city.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I draw several long breaths in my nose and out my mouth before he releases me, just as Bertram, Pax, and Ryder finally catch up.  We enter the main room of the command post, packed to the walls with knights and soldiers. In the corner, the Line Type machines send a one-way barrage of signals across wires. There are three of them: one for the war front, one for the capital, and one that&apos;s used for up north, rarely getting an answer to anything.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Status of Blackwater?&quot; Aldrin orders.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Clearing the line right now to get their response,&quot; a guard says.</p><p>&emsp;Loud chirps on the line screech with the strain of such distance. The vibrations resonate different-shaped keys that dance in their fixtures, stamping against a swiftly scrolling sheet of paper. A long half-minute passes, and the guard impatiently waits until there&apos;s enough information to report on.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Blackwater is safe,&quot; the guard says first. &quot;A civilian event in the north district. General Ullrich sending Royal Guard to investigate, not a Mask event, full stop,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;The room breathes a collective sigh of relief.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Was it perpetrated by Chymaeran meddling?&quot; Aldrin asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t think so,&quot; he says. &quot;I&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We don&apos;t &apos;think&apos; here! We speak when we know, and we know when we do,&quot; he barks. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh-Understood, sir.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Relay to the Valensends in the Capital. And send it to the boys at the front, so they don&apos;t have something extra to stress over tonight,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Prompting the line,&quot; the others say, setting the mechanical keys in position.</p><p>&emsp;Aldrin turns from the command zone to address the mix of soldiers and guards. &quot;Looks like an oddity: maybe Essence stores ignited. If it was a Divine Wish, we would know it &mdash; it surely would have done a lot more damage. I&apos;ve heard some group up there called the &apos;Carmine&apos; hoards dead Essence, so maybe it was them,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;He turns to the guildscribes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll run a couple scouting parties, just in case. Write up some quest forms for the new knights: this is a good excuse to get some experience and some exercise.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The guildscribes nod before he turns to us again, waiting until all the novice knights file in through the double doors.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Things should die down in a week, but we&apos;re going to keep the city on alert. We want to be sure that the Chymaera aren&apos;t using this as an opportunity to strike.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I know what he&apos;s going to ask for next when his eyes dart between the new recruits. I try to dissolve into the crowd, hoping the discomfort in my chest is just exhaustion from running across the town.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I need volunteers for night watch, to head north and see what&apos;s going on,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s worth a quest. Extra work means an extra day off.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I falter when I&apos;m shoulder-to-shoulder with my colleagues. Guilt and shame tug me forward, but that same crushing feeling I found in the cabin is so much stronger.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is easy. No more than several hours,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;You&apos;re all going to do this, is what I hear.</p><p>&emsp;I can only watch as my colleagues step forward, arranging themselves in groups, but I taste the smoke. I&apos;m snared in the past. I can see the Chymaerans and their glowing, amethyst eyes as they penetrate the shattered glass windows, stretching with their sharp obsidian limbs to finish what the fire began.</p><p>&emsp;This self-immolating spite can only swell when the lust for flight outpaces fight. My hands run cold as if the Chymaeran Curse were churning in my circuits, chilling my veins, and I have to lean against the wall to catch a breath.</p><p>&emsp;Bertram follows me outside. I&apos;m fortunate that the others are too distracted to witness this moment of utter weakness.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s going on, Kat?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I feel sick,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Right now? All of a sudden?&quot; He asks.</p><p>&emsp;I feel like I&apos;m going to lose my breakfast and lunch. It&apos;s only then that he realizes he&apos;s drawing attention.</p><p>&emsp;I feel a shock pulse my body when the worst comes to pass, unable to speak or explain when Aldrin steps outside.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s going on here?&quot; Aldrin asks.</p><p>&emsp;I don&apos;t want to look weak, but maybe I should just tell him. There&apos;s no way out of this. After I think I have a grasp on my nausea, I open my mouth to speak.</p><p>&emsp;But Bertram beats me to it.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s been feeling sick since the farm,&quot; he says. &quot;They were trying to be nice with the samples and the free meal, and we were trying to be respectful: first day, you know. But after all the running...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;She seemed fine minutes ago,&quot; Aldrin says.</p><p>&emsp;I doubt this farce will work. I say, &quot;No, I&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because she didn&apos;t want to look weak on the first day,&quot; Bertram says. &quot;Don&apos;t you know how hard it is for her? She talked to me the whole way back about it, being a female guard and all, trying not to prove the stereotype.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh,&quot; Aldrin says. He approaches, placing his glove on my shoulder. &quot;I respect that. We refuse to have that kind of backwards thinking in our ranks. We&apos;re trying to get rid of it. But you&apos;re not of use to me if you&apos;re not at your best,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;I can feel the cold night air again. I manage to stand upright without the wall.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;T-thank you,&quot; I say, wiping my mouth, although my stomach and its contents are still there.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Go home and get some rest: this is hardly a task, I just wanted an excuse to give you junior guards some exercise,&quot; he tells me. &quot;And Berry&mdash;would you mind walking her home?&quot; He hands two quest forms to him. &quot;Bring these back to me tomorrow. I&apos;ll give you credit.&quot; And then he whispers: &quot;Just don&apos;t tell anyone else.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, sir. Thank you, sir,&quot; Bertram says, taking my arm before he escorts me towards the complex. We make sure to pass the gates before we drop the act.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;&quot;What was that about?&quot; Bertram asks. The grasp of his hands on my torso is so strong that I hardly have to walk.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I ... I don&apos;t know,&quot; I tell him. &quot;I thought I got over this. I thought I wasn&apos;t so damn weak and pathetic...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re not pathetic! You earned your presence here,&quot; he assures me. &quot;You had a bad day, is all.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But how can I last when it&apos;s really down to the wire, when it&apos;s real, if my mind fights me at something so simple, so stupid and pathetic and weak, like this?&quot; I let out an exasperated groan. If he wasn&apos;t holding me, I might bash myself in the face with my gauntlets.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll take it step-by-step. You have time. Space in some scouting missions between the banal tasks,&quot; he insists.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But that was the first step. It was a step down. It was so low that it couldn&apos;t have even been called a step, and I tripped,&quot; I tell him, feeling the tears well up in my eyes. &quot;We went through the same thing that day, how does it not come back to haunt you? Why don&apos;t you run? Why are you so still?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he tells me, still holding me upright when all I want to do is crumble. &quot;I just live in the absolute present. I just find that I&apos;m less attached to it all: maybe I just don&apos;t care what happens.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What does that even mean?&quot; I ask, wiping my eyes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know. Maybe I&apos;m just bad at describing it,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I can feel him quickly release his hands when he realizes he&apos;s holding me up by the contours of my breastplate.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sorry.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The suddenness gets me to crack a smile. It escalates further. Pretty soon we&apos;re both laughing, and I wipe the tears from my eyes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But really, though. I promise that I&apos;ll always have your back. I won&apos;t go off and die on you,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You better not,&quot; I tell him, still letting off a couple chuckles before my lungs settle. &quot;We&apos;ll defend some more vegetables tomorrow. Maybe even something more dangerous.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Really sharp carrots?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll look forward to it,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;There&apos;s a certain hesitation in him when he stands close, as if there&apos;s something more he wants to say. But the moment passes. Instead, he hands me my copy of the quest sheet.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well,&quot; he says. &quot;I guess I&apos;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Until tomorrow,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;I wave to him as I fumble for the key in my pocket; feeling for the name etched into the iron; making sure it&apos;s still there; praying to the Gods that it won&apos;t be ground any further. There&apos;s a sweet smell of grilled meat that makes me hungry: someone cooks a pig on a spit across the way. </p><p>&emsp;Longing for rations after a long day, I turn my head to the entry window, trying to decide what I&apos;ll make. But instead, I find an odd, unflickering light illuminating the walls.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My body is out of adrenaline, so I&apos;m strangely calm. I approach the window instead of the door, trying to remember if I latched the back window after getting free breakfast from the merchants. I press my ear to the thin, wavy glass for an auditory cue: unable to see clearly through the drawn curtains, holding my breath until I hear the words of a foreign tongue. The words lack the harshness of Chymaeran dialect. Maybe it&apos;s Ahkvasan? Auvryan or Verdalan? One of the old dialects?</p><p>&emsp;I can only make out the silhouette of a stumbling man, holding something thicker than a rapier but thinner than a sword. He doesn&apos;t seem to be taking anything. Maybe this is a test &mdash; maybe Aldrin didn&apos;t mean it and wants to see if my actions can match my claims to courage.</p><p>&emsp;I approach the front door, allowing the burgeoning anger of my incompetence to consume me, leaving no space for fear. My hand is steady, unsheathing the dagger as I gingerly turn the key in the lock until it clicks. There&apos;s no room for explanation that this isn&apos;t a test or a burglar, so I let the Essence saturate my circuits.</p><p>&emsp;I turn the handle and rush the intruder. I spring forward with such force that the floorboards nearly snap when they give. My circuits run hot with Essence. My hands glow orange with heat, ready to burn their flesh until they beg to be sent to the Reservoir of Souls. </p><p>&emsp;I cross the entire span of the bottom floor.</p><p>&emsp;But just before I&apos;m ready to deal his death, he turns to face me, and I&apos;m unable to reconcile the oddness of his appearance.</p><p>&emsp;The man looks no older than I am, somewhere halfway mixed between a Royal and a vagrant. The fineness of his silken shirt is accented with a checkered pattern of light blue boxes. The fabric is whiter than snow. His stubble is unkempt and shaggy though his light brown hair is clipped finer than all the royals I&apos;ve ever seen. His brown eyes widen with panic as I intercept him, casting him over the kitchen table, and against the back wall, searing the fabric of his fine shirt with fire before I can withdraw the heat from my hands.</p><p>&emsp;He drops the strange sword against the ground, and it looks like a metal training stick that ends with a basket, not even a blade. </p><p>&emsp;Is it a broom? Is he some kind of housekeeper hired by the Royal Guard, another service like the knocker?</p><p>&emsp;He&apos;s far too weak to put up a fight when I straddle him against the floor, his face smudged in the puddle of porridge I left when I was rushing out the door. He&apos;s so weak that I have to lighten my grasp or else I might break his bones.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that he spills his first string of words to me. And somehow, I understand them perfectly.</p>"

        "<p id=\"1.7.1.32\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We tap our circuits for Essence, for the strength in our legs to descend faster and faster, predicating the call to Gaffesend Base. The trail ends on the side of the long, wrapping road we tried to cut, and then it&apos;s a dead sprint. </p>",

My sickening fear and small size propel me far ahead of the others, drawing on more anxiety than Essence as I tear past the landmarks of our small town. The trail transitions from matted dirt to concrete, to cobblestone, then back to concrete, until I&apos;m rushing along the west edge of the lake in the military district: dragged forward by the weight of the thin breastplate; begged by my burning lungs to stop or else I might collapse into the water.</p>"

        "<p id=\"1.7.3.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My body is out of adrenaline, so I&apos;m strangely calm. I approach the window instead of the door, trying to remember if I latched the back window after getting free breakfast from the merchants. I press my ear to the thin, wavy glass for an auditory cue: unable to see clearly through the drawn curtains, holding my breath until I hear the words of a foreign tongue. The words lack the harshness of Chymaeran dialect. Maybe it&apos;s Ahkvasan? Auvryan or Verdalan? One of the old dialects?</p>",

He doesn&apos;t seem to be taking anything. Maybe this is a test &mdash; maybe Aldrin didn&apos;t mean it and wants to see if my actions can match my claims to courage.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.7.3.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I approach the front door, allowing the burgeoning anger of my incompetence to consume me, leaving no space for fear. My hand is steady, unsheathing the dagger as I gingerly turn the key in the lock until it clicks. There&apos;s no room for explanation that this isn&apos;t a test or a burglar, so I let the Essence saturate my circuits.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.7.3.27\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I turn the handle and rush the intruder. I spring forward with such force that the floorboards nearly snap when they give. My circuits run hot with Essence. My hands glow orange with heat, ready to burn their flesh until they beg to be sent to the Reservoir of Souls. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.7.3.28\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I cross the entire span of the bottom floor.</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.7.3.30\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The man looks no older than I am, somewhere halfway mixed between a Royal and a vagrant. The fineness of his silken shirt is accented with a checkered pattern of light blue boxes. The fabric is whiter than snow. His stubble is unkempt and shaggy though his light brown hair is clipped finer than all the royals I&apos;ve ever seen. His brown eyes widen with panic as I intercept him, casting him over the kitchen table, and against the back wall, searing the fabric of his fine shirt with fire before I can withdraw the heat from my hands.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.7.3.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He drops the strange sword against the ground, and it looks like a metal training stick that ends with a basket, not even a blade. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.7.3.32\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Is it a broom? Is he some kind of housekeeper hired by the Royal Guard, another service like the knocker?</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.7.3.33\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He&apos;s far too weak to put up a fight when I straddle him against the floor, his face smudged in the puddle of porridge I left when I was rushing out the door. He&apos;s so weak that I have to lighten my grasp or else I might break his bones.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.7.3.34\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;It&apos;s then that he spills his first string of words to me. And somehow, I understand them perfectly.</p>"

Freaky Friday autoplays on some free streaming service, since I was too lazy to enter the family account. I reach to turn off the floor-bound wall TV, but I hesitate &mdash; finding that I enjoy the faint sound of it over the silence.</p><p>&emsp;It feels nice to have my friend here, I think.</p><p>&emsp;The tears still wet my face, more from the laughter of digging up past memories than the emptiness. I find myself disoriented when I try to walk, so I lift my old lacrosse stick from the ground to use it as a cane, digging my fingers into the mesh of the basket. I realize there must be an open window when a chill convects the wetness of my skin.</p><p>&emsp;I hobble towards the wall, nearly in-step with Miguel&apos;s snore, trying to dodge the crumpled cans. The window is open, but the breeze funnels out instead of in. </p><p>&emsp;I remember my first Thermo class. Isn&apos;t hot supposed to run to cold?</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m not in a headspace where I can read the clues. My stomach pangs when the sweet aroma of fresh meat fills the vacant home. I look out the open window, as if any one of my older neighbors would be grilling burgers at one o&apos;clock in the morning. But I know the college years of that are long behind me.</p><p>&emsp;My ears pop when I drag the window closed along its tracks. The air is dry, and when I stumble towards the source of the gusting winds &mdash; the small closet beneath the stairs &mdash;a faint, flickering light glows in the space beneath the door.</p><p>&emsp;An empty can crunches when I step on it, and I realize I&apos;m still wearing my steel-toed shoes, along with the rest of my casual work clothes. The lacrosse stick braces me as I stumble forwards&mdash;feeling like my uncle does on Ambien when he doesn&apos;t fall asleep in time&mdash;until my hand touches the freezing handle.</p><p>&emsp;Tumultuous winds scream beneath the door and through the cracks, bashing the fitting against the lock. My mind doesn&apos;t work well when it&apos;s crossed, but I find myself fixated on how strange the closet door looks. I never noticed the handle, etched with an intricacy so far outside the palate of the builders&apos; package. Surely Mom or Dad would have noticed it on any one of the tours, right?</p><p>&emsp;I turn the knob far enough that the bolt no longer withholds the gale. The wooden door buffets me in the face. Stars flash in my vision, and if it weren&apos;t for the lacrosse stick, I would have slammed my head on the granite counter. Instead, I find myself slumped beneath the bartop, barricaded by two metal stools.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m speechless until the rooms equalize in pressure, rubbing out the ache in my forehead. I lift my eyes. No longer does the closet greet me, but the light of a whole other townhouse on the opposing side.</p><p>&emsp;Unable to fathom whether this dream is just the imaginings of an inebriated mind, I lift myself from the floor and stumble through the threshold of the archway. The contours of the floor change from that of smooth, buffered wood to sanded planks and stone. On the other side is another thick wooden door with the same handle, thrown all the way open. I wonder if my neighbors are so old that they insist on the technology of the last century. Who would spend the money to furnish their townhome this way, with walls and decor so aged my great-grandmother would feel at home?</p><p>&emsp;It feels so wrong to be here, but I&apos;m a social drunk, and this is a chance to make friends.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hello? You forgot to lock your door. Sorry to intrude &mdash; I&apos;m the neighbor from the unit on the other side. My name is Cody, Cody Dunsmore,&quot; I say, and so I continue, stammering my words to ensure my presence isn&apos;t a surprise, though with cast iron kettles and candles, I doubt these fogies would be agile enough to swing anything at their friendly intruder.</p><p>&emsp;I find a knight&apos;s uniform on the table, tailored to a woman&apos;s measurements, along with realistic metal boots.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The old bat must be into costume play. Whatever gets you off,&quot; I mutter, but then I see the biggest surprise leaning against the wall. I try to take it in my hands, but it&apos;s so damn heavy: nothing like the weapons those mall ninjas buy at conventions.</p><p>&emsp;I drop the lacrosse stick to try to lift it. Surely it&apos;s one of those real-looking swords the neckbeards buy, right?</p><p>&emsp;Nope.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Christ almighty!&quot; I exclaim.</p><p>&emsp;I try to steady it the same way I saw in the movies, but it kills my wrists. I wonder how many exercises these geriatric fantasy fetishists have to do to hold a sword like this, like holding a barbell by its end.</p><p>&emsp;I put it back against the wall, and I decide to try speaking again. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hello? You left your door open.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;The house smells too musty to be a new build, like it&apos;s seen generations of families through its halls. Spiderwebs collect in the corners of the cabinets. The crimson curtains are bleached from decades of continuous sunlight. And when I fumble for a light switch on the walls, I find nothing: nor a single cord in this simple home snaked across the surface.</p><p>&emsp;The space is dead silent in the absence of appliances: so silent that I can hear the heartbeat in my ears. Maybe I should return home to try again tomorrow. </p><p>&emsp;But my plan is cut short when a shadow slides behind the marbled glass.</p><p>&emsp;I haven&apos;t the time to react when the door blasts open, screeching on rusted hinges. The intruder closes the distance before I even have a chance to react, blasting their glowing palm against my shoulder, casting me over their dining table with a whole handprint burned into my beer-stained work shirt.</p><p>&emsp;The female knight is quick to pin me against the floor, straddling me with her bare thighs. My mind races to explain. I can only consider she&apos;s an influencer, or one of those intensely dedicated cosplayers I found LARPing on campus. Her speech is incoherent, but the longer she berates me in her mother language, drawing the prop knife against my neck as I struggle under her inhuman strength, a strange comprehension of her words slowly overtakes me.</p><p>&emsp;I feel the sentiment behind her panic. I thought she was just speaking in tongues, but I can feel my mind strain as it arranges itself to piece together the meaning of the words. And when the headache passes, I realize that I can understand her fully.</p><p>&emsp;Her voice is beautiful.</p><p>&emsp;Her eyes are a golden hazel from colored contacts, and she&apos;s dressed like one of those hobbyists at the Shaleborough Renaissance Faire. Her blond, silken braid hangs from her head as she leans over me, making her look more like an angry princess than a defensive knight.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please, please,&quot; I beg. </p><p>&emsp;But I find the panic in her face to be even greater than mine. She breathes heavily with trembling hands, rocking on my torso with every shallow breath. It&apos;s the most excitement I&apos;ve felt in ages. The sudden rise in emotion ignites something I&apos;m even more afraid of, and I try to make it known to her. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I think you should get off me, I&mdash;I can&apos;t control it,&quot; I say, but she&apos;s clueless about what she does to me, straddling my waist with her strong, bare thighs.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asks.</p><p>&emsp;My arms are pinned beneath her legs. The pressure pounds in my skull. There&apos;s no chance to try the waistband trick, and there&apos;s only one place that all the blood can go.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re a fool to break into the military district. I&apos;m a knight of the Royal Guard,&quot; she declares, as the sharp edge of the very real knife digs into my neck. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t think you understand. I can&apos;t control what&apos;s going to happen,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You pathetic weakling, what could you possibly do now?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She has the upper hand. And all I have is a single word I learned on the Internet.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;S-S-Scaroused.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Scaroused?&quot; The words might be lost, but she definitely notices the new sapling in her living room. </p>",
      "<p>&emsp;If he wasn&apos;t handsome, I would have slit his throat. My mind can&apos;t catch up fast enough for all the semantics, but I know exactly what he means.</p><p>&emsp;I can feel it.</p><p>&emsp;My face flushes. &quot;You degenerate! You lecherous, filthy animal, breaking into my house to . . . to&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I swear, I didn&apos;t break in here,&quot; he insists. His face is redder than mine. He covers his crotch with his hands, as if hiding the pitched tent can make me forget. &quot;The door was open. I just walked in.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The door was locked, you fool,&quot; I say, pointing to the narrowly-cracked entry door behind me, but he gestures with his head to the small closet. &quot;The closet? How would you break in through a damn closet? There&apos;s no windows in there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know, but please. I&apos;m as confused as you are,&quot; he says. &quot;Give me a chance to explain.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re excited, not confused!&quot; I point the dagger between his legs. &quot;You don&apos;t have the right to be confused right now. I&apos;m the one that&apos;s confused at how&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;Would you let me explain? Dear God!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s Gods, you heretic,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Respect other races. We&apos;re not the only one that shares Fosroth, and all our Gods have proven their presence.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;God, I said,&quot; he says. &quot;A real god, not the ones you cosplay freaks pretend to worship.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do you want to be executed for apostasy? Because I can do that for you, right now,&quot; I notice that his eyes keep falling on the closet. The closet, my bare legs, my breastplate, and then the closet. I circle between him and the door, leaving only the entrance as an escape: like coaxing a rat out of the house without having to kill it.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What I want is to go home,&quot; he says. &quot;Not to get stabbed by a letter opener. I&apos;m your neighbor, and the door between our units was open. I was simply trying to tell you,&quot; the liar insists. He heaves for a couple breaths. &quot;Did you really have to tackle me to get your point across?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You do not live here. This is the Military District. Besides &mdash; you&apos;ve proved that you are far too weak to live here,&quot; I say, approaching him with the dagger.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You bitch, I can bench a plate at least,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Putting plates on benches? What, are you a fat oaf that eats outside all day?&quot; but he looks reasonably fit beneath his ruined shirt. Defined shoulder muscles, trained without Essence . . . maybe he&apos;s a laboring refugee from the North?</p><p>&emsp;He raises his hands as he tries to stand up with only his legs, but he can&apos;t. &quot;I&apos;m sorry to intrude. Look. I know you might be into cosplay or whatever, but this is taking things way too far.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cosplay?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Costume play. At first I thought it was old people living here: the kettle, the candles . . . I mean, the whole damn house is set up like Skyrim.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Costume?</p><p>&emsp;A fucking costume?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is not a COSTUME!&quot;  </p><p>&emsp;He shrinks at the thunder in my voice. His singed nobleman&apos;s shirt hangs open as he edges towards the front door on his hands and knees, and I follow him step-for-step. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do you know how hard I worked for this?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah . . . lots of trips to the craft store,&quot; he adds.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How hard I worked to wear this proudly as a guardian?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Did you make it during the craft foam sale? I go there for the graphing pencils.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What the Res are you talking about?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Mechanical pencils,&quot; he rambles. &quot;Point-five is a toothpick, and point-nine is like a fucking crayon&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You dare to insult me like this? For what, because I&apos;m a female guard?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. Of course not, you&apos;re very convincing.&quot; His voice crackles on every other syllable, trying to inject some abject form of flattery. &quot;It&apos;s amazing. Prop knife? Form-fit foam from the craft store, spray-painted to look like metal armor? Even the stitching looks like an eighteenth-century corset. I can tell you&apos;ve put a lot of time into it. You&apos;re a lot like my older cousin, and I&apos;m sure you have loads of followers like she does. I know I&apos;d follow you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re too yellow to follow me anywhere,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;On-line, I mean,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;On what line?&quot; I ask. &quot;The front? You would never get close. They&apos;d keep you busy peeling potatoes with such soft hands.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Soft hands? Please. You&apos;re the job that banks on soft hands. While you&apos;re busy pleasuring perverts over your webcam, I work in an office. Designing the damn future. Because the rest of us have to work real jobs, not getting paid by thirsty horndogs that jerk off to Shakespeare.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The real work is defending the ungrateful, undeserving gentry like you. Why don&apos;t you crawl back to mummy and daddy dearest for another bump to your filthy allowance?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;That last line would provoke any true noble. I expect him to go cry fowl to his underpaid servants, to his nanny, or to his absentee parents, complaining all way up the chain to my captain. I sincerely hope he does, because Aldrin is backwater enough to hate anything that wears its wealth and wreaks of privilege.</p><p>&emsp;But hes&apos;s not that kind of upset. He doesn&apos;t seem offended in any way. This idiot still holds a sense of humor, as if he thinks it&apos;s all a ruse. The further the corners of his mouth crease on a laugh, the more it infuriates me, and as he stands, he opens his stupid mouth to cross the line.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Enough pretend. Your knife isn&apos;t even real.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Pray tell, does this feel real?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I take a slash at his arm, trying to carve him with something small and impermanent: small enough to disappear in a day, but enough to remember the lesson. But the fool flinches, blocking my dagger with his left hand. </p><p>&emsp;Idiot.</p><p>&emsp;The edge catches on his palm, drawing an instant, deep line of gushing blood. His expression changes in an instant, as if surprised that knives have an edge to them. Maybe I&apos;ll have to explain next that my Essenced fire actually burns, and water actually drowns.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You . . . you actually . . .&quot; he starts, his back pressed against the front door as he watches the blood trickle down his left wrist, absorbing in the tarnished fabric of his charred left sleeve. </p><p>&emsp;I flick the crimson from the dagger, flipping it around to imply the next strike will impale him. &quot;It&apos;s time for you to leave. It&apos;s getting late, and by the Gods, I&apos;d rather abstain from filing a casualty report tonight.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He fumbles for the door with his working hand, wrapping his left palm in more of the pristine, white fabric, struggling to grasp the handle when his eyes are on the weapon. &quot;Jesus Christ! Are you insane? Do you have no boundary with your stupid fantasy? Castle Law or not, I&apos;m calling the police.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Get out,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This was my favorite shirt!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I said, GET OUT!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;As soon as the door cracks enough to silhouette his body against the night, I lift my leg and boot him square in the chest, planting a muddy print on the last untarnished space in the fabric. He falls over the first set of steps and lands in the dirt, groaning as I slam the door shut. </p><p>&emsp;He&apos;ll live.</p><p>&emsp;I rush to the window, throwing the shades open just enough to peer into the darkness, drawn by my biting curiosity to see what unfolds.  What an idiot &mdash; now he&apos;s struggling to tear the sleeve off his bloodstained shirt, ripping at the fabric where my Essenced plume singed it black.</p><p>&emsp;But it still bothers me. Why was he so drawn to the shallow closet? Even under duress, I don&apos;t know how he could be stupid enough to insist he entered through a door. There&apos;s surely nothing in this column of a cottage worth breaking into &mdash; especially into the home of a Royal Knight &mdash; unless he&apos;s some devious cretin that is after my intimates.</p><p>&emsp;After I back away from the window and toss the bloody dagger in the sink, I approach the closet door. </p><p>&emsp;Or at least I thought it was a closet. </p><p>&emsp;The space beyond the door frame spans for less than a foot before the faint candlelight is swallowed by darkness. But the darkness is so dense and miasmic, like peering through murky water.</p><p>&emsp;The tunnel opens itself to me as I approach the door. From the lines implied by the floors and walls, the small cupboard should be no deeper than a couple feet (enough to store winter uniforms and snowshoes for the cold season), but I find no definite end. The edge where the splintered floor meets the jagged wall just fades into obscurity, all the way though to the unit on the other side, where an unfamiliar twinkle of multicolored lights pierce the smooth walls.</p><p>&emsp;The corridor might be short, but it&apos;s still just a little too long. The neighboring wall would have to be deeper than the walls around Fort Gaffesend!</p><p>&emsp;It must be a trick of his.  He could be a cross-blood like Pax, except Auvryan; able to mess with minds; skilled enough in his race&apos;s  gift to conjure convincing illusions with his Essence. Maybe that&apos;s why he seemed so powerless with his Human gifts. Maybe he conjured that splitting headache before I barged in, or maybe he speaks through thoughts, unaccustomed to verbal speech, speaking words of a foreign language though my mind heard something else. Is my mind being twisted further, to show something that isn&apos;t there? Does he still deceive me from beyond the door? I refuse to fall for this pathetic excuse of a trick, so I decide to test the bewildering portal.</p><p>&emsp;I reach first with my gauntlet, dragging through the viscous black as if collapsing spiderwebs. I notice the breeze at my back, strong enough to pierce the layers of my uniform, ushering me deeper and deeper. My trembling hand passes where the wall should be, and then my arm, and then the rest of my body, and as all the sound of the quaint cottage and the outside world fade behind me, I realize I&apos;m twice as deep as the rules of space should allow. I think of the old stories of the Verdalans, the masters of space whose bodies descended from the fibrous jungle, defending their ancient capital with an infinite wall of twisting jungle. Just as their Essence warped space, entrapping their adversaries in endless loops of attrition, I feel my stomach twist as my senses confirm a truth that the mind refuses to accept.</p>"

        "<p id=\"1.8.2.5\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;The door was locked, you fool,&quot; I say, pointing to the narrowly-cracked entry door behind me, but he gestures with his head to the small closet. &quot;The closet? How would you break in through a damn closet? There&apos;s no windows in there.&quot;</p>",

The closet, my bare legs, my breastplate, and then the closet. I circle between him and the door, leaving only the entrance as an escape: like coaxing a rat out of the house without having to kill it.</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.8.2.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Putting plates on benches? What, are you a fat oaf that eats outside all day?&quot; but he looks reasonably fit beneath his ruined shirt. Defined shoulder muscles, trained without Essence . . . maybe he&apos;s a laboring refugee from the North?</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He raises his hands as he tries to stand up with only his legs, but he can&apos;t. &quot;I&apos;m sorry to intrude. Look. I know you might be into cosplay or whatever, but this is taking things way too far.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.8.2.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah . . . lots of trips to the craft store,&quot; he adds.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;How hard I worked to wear this proudly as a guardian?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Did you make it during the craft foam sale? I go there for the graphing pencils.&quot;</p>",

Prop knife? Form-fit foam from the craft store, spray-painted to look like metal armor? Even the stitching looks like an eighteenth-century corset. I can tell you&apos;ve put a lot of time into it. You&apos;re a lot like my older cousin, and I&apos;m sure you have loads of followers like she does. I know I&apos;d follow you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re too yellow to follow me anywhere,&quot; I say.</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.8.2.33\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;On what line?&quot; I ask. &quot;The front? You would never get close. They&apos;d keep you busy peeling potatoes with such soft hands.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.34\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Soft hands? Please. You&apos;re the job that banks on soft hands. While you&apos;re busy pleasuring perverts over your webcam, I work in an office. Designing the damn future. Because the rest of us have to work real jobs, not getting paid by thirsty horndogs that jerk off to Shakespeare.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.35\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;The real work is defending the ungrateful, undeserving gentry like you. Why don&apos;t you crawl back to mummy and daddy dearest for another bump to your filthy allowance?&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.36\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;That last line would provoke any true noble. I expect him to go cry fowl to his underpaid servants, to his nanny, or to his absentee parents, complaining all way up the chain to my captain. I sincerely hope he does, because Aldrin is backwater enough to hate anything that wears its wealth and wreaks of privilege.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.37\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But hes&apos;s not that kind of upset. He doesn&apos;t seem offended in any way. This idiot still holds a sense of humor, as if he thinks it&apos;s all a ruse. The further the corners of his mouth crease on a laugh, the more it infuriates me, and as he stands, he opens his stupid mouth to cross the line.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.38\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Enough pretend. Your knife isn&apos;t even real.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.39\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Pray tell, does this feel real?&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.40\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I take a slash at his arm, trying to carve him with something small and impermanent: small enough to disappear in a day, but enough to remember the lesson. But the fool flinches, blocking my dagger with his left hand. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.41\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Idiot.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.42\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The edge catches on his palm, drawing an instant, deep line of gushing blood. His expression changes in an instant, as if surprised that knives have an edge to them. Maybe I&apos;ll have to explain next that my Essenced fire actually burns, and water actually drowns.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.43\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You . . . you actually . . .&quot; he starts, his back pressed against the front door as he watches the blood trickle down his left wrist, absorbing in the tarnished fabric of his charred left sleeve. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.44\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I flick the crimson from the dagger, flipping it around to imply the next strike will impale him. &quot;It&apos;s time for you to leave. It&apos;s getting late, and by the Gods, I&apos;d rather abstain from filing a casualty report tonight.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.45\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He fumbles for the door with his working hand, wrapping his left palm in more of the pristine, white fabric, struggling to grasp the handle when his eyes are on the weapon. &quot;Jesus Christ! Are you insane? Do you have no boundary with your stupid fantasy? Castle Law or not, I&apos;m calling the police.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.46\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Get out,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.47\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;This was my favorite shirt!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.48\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I said, GET OUT!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.49\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;As soon as the door cracks enough to silhouette his body against the night, I lift my leg and boot him square in the chest, planting a muddy print on the last untarnished space in the fabric. He falls over the first set of steps and lands in the dirt, groaning as I slam the door shut. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.50\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He&apos;ll live.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.51\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I rush to the window, throwing the shades open just enough to peer into the darkness, drawn by my biting curiosity to see what unfolds.  What an idiot &mdash; now he&apos;s struggling to tear the sleeve off his bloodstained shirt, ripping at the fabric where my Essenced plume singed it black.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.52\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But it still bothers me. Why was he so drawn to the shallow closet? Even under duress, I don&apos;t know how he could be stupid enough to insist he entered through a door. There&apos;s surely nothing in this column of a cottage worth breaking into &mdash; especially into the home of a Royal Knight &mdash; unless he&apos;s some devious cretin that is after my intimates.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.53\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;After I back away from the window and toss the bloody dagger in the sink, I approach the closet door. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.54\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Or at least I thought it was a closet. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.55\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The space beyond the door frame spans for less than a foot before the faint candlelight is swallowed by darkness. But the darkness is so dense and miasmic, like peering through murky water.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.56\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The tunnel opens itself to me as I approach the door. From the lines implied by the floors and walls, the small cupboard should be no deeper than a couple feet (enough to store winter uniforms and snowshoes for the cold season), but I find no definite end. The edge where the splintered floor meets the jagged wall just fades into obscurity, all the way though to the unit on the other side, where an unfamiliar twinkle of multicolored lights pierce the smooth walls.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.57\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The corridor might be short, but it&apos;s still just a little too long. The neighboring wall would have to be deeper than the walls around Fort Gaffesend!</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.58\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;It must be a trick of his.  He could be a cross-blood like Pax, except Auvryan; able to mess with minds; skilled enough in his race&apos;s  gift to conjure convincing illusions with his Essence. Maybe that&apos;s why he seemed so powerless with his Human gifts. Maybe he conjured that splitting headache before I barged in, or maybe he speaks through thoughts, unaccustomed to verbal speech, speaking words of a foreign language though my mind heard something else. Is my mind being twisted further, to show something that isn&apos;t there? Does he still deceive me from beyond the door? I refuse to fall for this pathetic excuse of a trick, so I decide to test the bewildering portal.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.8.2.59\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I reach first with my gauntlet, dragging through the viscous black as if collapsing spiderwebs. I notice the breeze at my back, strong enough to pierce the layers of my uniform, ushering me deeper and deeper. My trembling hand passes where the wall should be, and then my arm, and then the rest of my body, and as all the sound of the quaint cottage and the outside world fade behind me, I realize I&apos;m twice as deep as the rules of space should allow. I think of the old stories of the Verdalans, the masters of space whose bodies descended from the fibrous jungle, defending their ancient capital with an infinite wall of twisting jungle. Just as their Essence warped space, entrapping their adversaries in endless loops of attrition, I feel my stomach twist as my senses confirm a truth that the mind refuses to accept.</p>"

      "<p>&emsp;I wince at the pins and needles throbbing in my hand, thinking about how I&apos;m gonna borrow my cousin and her law degree and sue that damn bitch. Engineering might make me just enough to get by beyond the mortgage, but there&apos;s no way in hell I&apos;m paying for medical care. I&apos;ll take an Uber to the hospital before I call an ambulance.</p><p>&emsp;Cursing under my breath makes it easier to bear. I tear the sleeve off my muddy, bloodstained shirt so I can try to wrap it up, all while I try to remember the content of my middle school health class.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s the first time I&apos;m able to look around and take in my surroundings. The sky is overcast and pitch-dark, with none of Denver&apos;s light pollution obscuring the stars. A great body of water spans before me, which is puzzling: if I left the adjoining unit from the front, shouldn&apos;t Emerald Lake be a couple blocks away?</p><p>&emsp;My housing development is devoid of streetlights by design, but when I squint to see the lights that illuminate the road, they flicker. The roads are dirty. And as I grasp the fabric of my tattered shirt as tightly as I can, plotting a large, crimson cardioid, I wonder how the HOA could ever let things get this bad with how much they scalp me every month.</p><p>&emsp;A couple strangers approach. They hasten their walk when they find I&apos;m on my knees: two of them far larger than I am, but all four of them far more built. They&apos;re carrying swords and wearing armor.</p><p>&emsp;I don&apos;t know whether to laugh or to cry.</p><p>&emsp;Hiding behind them is a furry, watching nervously. I&apos;m distracted by how perfect their fursuit is: her eyes move away when I try to meet them, flicking the tail with some kind of servo or something.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What is going on in this suburb? Early Halloween? Did y&apos;all leave a D&D session? I thought it was all old people here,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Old people? This is the Millitary District,&quot; one of them says, &apos;casting fire&apos; in their palm to give us some light. I&apos;m impressed at how well they sell it.</p><p>&emsp;The darker-skinned bald one bends down to look at my palm, still taller than my crouch at half his height. &quot;You have got a good slice there. What happened?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Was it Chymaerans?&quot; The other lunk says.</p><p>&emsp;The others look at him disapprovingly.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Enough of the Chymaeran talk,&quot; says a woman with short, dirty blond hair. &quot;I&apos;ve got the training. I can heal him.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;As in a med-kit?&quot; I ask. &quot;Some peroxide and a bandage?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; She says, snarkily. &quot;Essence.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What is that?&quot; I expect it&apos;s an off-brand painkiller or holistic herbs, nothing better than a Band-Aid.</p><p>&emsp;She says, &quot;Look &mdash; do you want my help or not?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; I say. She groans in annoyance before taking my palm between her hands. &quot;Where&apos;s the Neighborhood Patrol? I thought the cops were supposed to be out since those kids went tagging at the pool,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What in Khiras&apos; name are you on about?&quot; The African-American one asks. He looks me up and down. &quot;You&apos;re rather odd. Are you sure you&apos;re from here? What&apos;s your name, anyway?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Name? He who asks should give their name first,&quot; I say. These weeaboos might get a kick from an anime reference if they&apos;re gonna pretend-heal me with their Etsy light gloves.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;My name is Ryder Zebal. This is Jullian, Oria, Pax, and Caeda,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;Might as well befriend the neighbors. &quot;I&apos;m Cody. Cody Dunsmore, and I just moved here.&quot; I realize I don&apos;t have a hand to shake: my left one is being healed with what feels like glove-warmers and LEDs.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Too strange for a Chymaeran,&quot; the lunk called Pax says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about your papers?&quot; Ryder asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh ... alright.&quot; The word &apos;papers&apos; is kinda weird, but I play along with their improv, in case they live close and I&apos;ll have to see them again.</p><p>&emsp;I reach into my back pocket with my right hand, but my wallet isn&apos;t there. I must have left it on the counter after I tipped the delivery guy.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hold on a sec,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;They reach for their swords though I can only reach one hand myself, all while Oriya is still &apos;working her magic.&apos;</p><p>&emsp;I retrieve my phone from my pocket. They stare as if it were some kind of monolith. I light the screen with a tap then swipe up to turn on the flashlight.</p><p>&emsp;Click.</p><p>&emsp;They instantly dive backwards, frightened when the blinding flash illuminates the streets brighter than the flickering lamps.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Good thing I downloaded the MyColorado App recently, in case the cops stop me and I forgot my license. Let&apos;s see here . . .&quot; I swipe down to type M-Y-C in the search bar, and then tap the first result.</p><p>&emsp;They&apos;re still petrified, standing there with their swords drawn.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Very funny. You guys are great at improv,&quot; I say. &quot;See? Right here. Class C. I can drive, officer.&quot; I hold the bright screen towards Ryder. He draws closer, entranced by the display.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What kind of magic is this? Are you some kind of mage? An inventor in the Royal Court of Science? Or are you a Mask? Of the Gods?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just an engineer,&quot; I tell them. &quot;Hardly one at that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;An inventor, then,&quot; Jullian says.</p><p>&emsp;I look to the full-on furry catgirl. She&apos;s hypnotized as if I shined a laser in front of her.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I should get going,&quot; I tell them, feeling light-headed. &quot;I&apos;ve got to get home and bandage this for real. It&apos;s going to&mdash;&quot; I flex my hand. It feels like nothing. I turn the flashlight from the roadway, looking down at my palm.</p><p>&emsp;I turn to Oriya. &quot;How in God&apos;s name did you do that? Did you glue it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, idiot. You&apos;re Human, aren&apos;t you? Don&apos;t you have the powers of fire and life?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No?&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, get on home,&quot; Oriya says. The others ramble to themselves about the strangeness of what just happened. Oriya reaches to hug Jullian&apos;s arm, and he uncomfortably obliges. I wait until the four of them disappear into the shadows.</p><p>&emsp;I try the handle of the door.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s locked.</p><p>&emsp;I run around the back, onto a cobblestone street. Counting as many houses over as it took to turn the corner, I try the window.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s open.</p><p>&emsp;I flex my left hand, still not feeling any anguish, pressing my ear to the window to try and discern where the girl is. I spend minutes listening to silence, until I hear Miguel&apos;s scream on the other side.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m mystified when I cross the threshold of the door. The room is dark, and though I can&apos;t make out the meager spread of items, I can sense how strange the shapes in this room are: so smooth and straight, as if they were cut by divine hands. When I find a glint in the artifacts on the shelves and walls&mdash;even the shelves themselves&mdash;I marvel at how much metal must have been wasted to produce all these things. He must be rich if he can waste money like this: maybe he&apos;s so rich that he bribed the Guard to let him live here, in a prime spot looking across the water.</p><p>&emsp;Does he actually live next door? Did I really mistake this as a closet? My metal boots clatter like hooves against the reflective wood floor, and I trace my finger along the polished granite table, trying to imagine how the resources got here.</p><p>&emsp;A crunch startles me. On the floor are what looks like hand-painted ration cans, but they&apos;re all crushed and ruined.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m startled again when I hear snoring in the corner, and I find another odd stranger. A friend? A lover? Maybe a visitor past curfew? My feet sink into the carpet when I approach him, wondering again how the scruffy noble could ever afford such luxurious flooring.</p><p>&emsp;The entire room stinks of man, but this one smells especially bad. He mumbles in a drunken stupor before he awakes, blinking his eyes like a toad.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh . . . hey.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hello,&quot; I say, wishing I had not ditched the dagger.</p><p>&emsp;He asks, &quot;And you are?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya. Katiya Breakey-Hilde,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Carajo. My homie&apos;s got no chill if he&apos;s bringing girls like you over while I&apos;m here. Must be desperate since he&apos;s got no hose.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A hose? Why would you&mdash;&quot; I begin to ask, but he cuts me off.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I think he&apos;s upstairs,&quot; he tells me, squinting his eyes, and then some semblance of recognition crosses his face. &quot;Wait a minute &mdash; you must be from that fantasy escort service down in Denver, what was it called, uh . . . Call To Adventure, or something like that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I only do escort missions through the Royal Guard,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hah. Good one,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It is good,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Good.&quot; He clicks his tongue. &quot;Figures. My boy Cody could never score a baddie like you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;An odd name.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;m Miguel.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Another odd name.</p><p>&emsp;He says, &quot;But he&apos;s a real one, let me tell you. My friend is the best dude you&apos;ll ever meet. I love that guy. You might be here for just a night &mdash; and, look, I know the whole thing about falling in love with a call girl &mdash; but give him a chance, huh? Even if it&apos;s just a booty call thing,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;His hand grazes the table, accidentally casting some black, slender object on the floor. It bounces twice before colliding with something else.</p><p>&emsp;I hear a click, and then behind me, a flash of colorful light envelops the room. I gasp when I turn to look, and my heart jumps into my throat.</p><p>&emsp;Behind the bright window, a mother and daughter are screaming at each other. It gives me such a start that I collapse into the couch. The woman is screaming, the daughter is screaming, I&apos;m screaming, and the man is shouting, trying to free himself from my armor.</p><p>&emsp;I spew a string of apologies as the woman in the window says something about wanting her body back, just as all I want is to go home. Too panicked to realize that the best direction is from whence I came, I sprint for the door as the other guy curses, grasping his leg.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;ll just go around like Cody. We&apos;ll trade places.</p><p>&emsp;Just like my intruder, I trip backwards out the door, scraping the edges of the cement with my plate armor as I slide down the sculpted stairs, coming directly to a stop beneath a blinding torchlight. I scramble to my feet to try and run, but everything is so bright and unfamiliar that I fall to my knees.</p><p>&emsp;The sky is cloudless, but I can&apos;t find a single star. Lake Garrison is nowhere to be found; instead of the distant lights of my hometown of Hillfar, a pattern of white-and-red dotted lights slide past each other on a hill, somewhere far beyond the eaves of two houses on the other side of the road.</p><p>&emsp;Something loud is approaching. I try to curl into a ball to protect myself, but the armor stiffens me too much. A massive automobile tears past, lighting the entire street with headlamps lodged in the front, unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen. It sounds like they have an entire orchestra in there behind the glass, but the deafening music fades . . . only to be replaced by two more loud metal chariots that shake the ground.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m quivering as I lay there in the grass, wondering where the garden is; why the lake isn&apos;t directly across from me; why stars shifted in the sky so swiftly. </p><p>&emsp;An old woman walks on the side of the street, and I consider she&apos;s a lamplighter until I see her holding a leash. She notices me crumpled in the grass on the verge of tears.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Are you alright, sweetheart?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I cry.</p><p>&emsp;Her familiar crosses the grass, nuzzling me with its wet nose before it licks my face.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, that&apos;s Doby. She&apos;s real friendly with all the young&apos;uns living around here &mdash; do you mind dogs? Or are you more of a cat person?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m a human person. A living human&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;I swear to the good Lord in heaven: if this neighborhood is turning into one of those &apos;college&apos; towns the Facebook talks about, with all these young&apos;uns in their new houses playing trapping music, I&apos;m going to lose it!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I haven&apos;t the time to protest when I hear a hissing noise, and it sounds like the elder is conjuring a serpent. Before I can react, I feel a cloudless rain, followed by a direct blast of water to my face, saturating the clothes beneath my armor in seconds.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why? Why do you torment me?&quot; I plead, my tears now inseparable from the water soaking me down to my underwear. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t set the timer on those sprinklers,&quot; she says, and then adds, &quot;damn beatnik.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;As I kneel in the muddy grass, sullying my new pants, I watch as the cantankerous woman retreats, dragging the mutt alongside her. A single, white moon hangs in the sky. Blinking red and white flashes somewhere even higher, casting smoke in a faint line, leaving the sound of a crackle as it slices the sky. I never knew the sky could be torn. </p><p>&emsp;With my mind petrified, locking my muscles, resigning me to soak in the jets of water, my body decides for me, urging me back inside to pass Cody&apos;s cursing companion.</p><p>&emsp;All I want is to return to the comfort of Fosroth where the world is uncomplicated. I want a cup of tea and a book beside the fire as I warm my bones. I will never bear witness to this horrifying illusion again.</p><p>&emsp;I ignore his companion&apos;s threat to take shots, though he holds a bottle instead of a gun, &mdash; asking if his friend paid for any more guards to defend this house. But as I stumble towards the closet, squeaking my saturated boots with each step, all I find is another figure, standing there at the back of the closet.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I throw open the window, dragging myself over the sill and depositing myself on the floor. My shoulder aches where her scalding hands burned me. I twist my body to get my feet beneath me, and manage to stand in front of the door.</p><p>&emsp;I level the lacrosse stick after I lift it off the floor, tearing off the rubber end cap, flipping it around so the basket faces me. And surely enough, like a reflection in the mirror, I find the female knight standing there on the other side.</p><p>&emsp;We pause there for a couple seconds. There&apos;s a panic still deep inside her eyes. I stagger my footing with my hands together on the stick, ready to body her with a cross-check, waiting for her to make the first move since I&apos;m on the defensive.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;En garde,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;And then she charges me.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I wager my strength and power over his defenses. The inebriated man called Cody holds the odd, metallic broomstick with his hands together in the center &mdash; a technique I&apos;ve never seen before &mdash; and calls out a phrase I can only decipher as a challenge.</p><p>&emsp;If it&apos;s a sword fight he wants, I know I can make it to the greatsword leaning against the wall, because if this Auvryan cross-blood wants to wreak havoc on my home life with his illusions, sullying the most sacred place I have to replenish myself and find respite, then I have no other choice. </p><p>&emsp;He must be destroyed.</p><p>&emsp;Cody drags his left foot behind him, bending his knees, leaning his body in a forward squat as if that can stop me. Surely this assassin is an Auvryan, and likely some kind of mercenary: their people are masters with pole weapons. But I doubt his technique is greater than the strength of a full-blooded Human flooded with Essence.</p><p>&emsp;I charge with my armored left shoulder, allowing the Essence to flow into my legs, flooding my muscles with such power that every step deflects the floorboards. I close the distance faster than he expects, but he remains steadfast, standing there with the metal broom raised to chest height, hinging his arms to receive the full force of my momentum.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s when I&apos;m three steps from deliverance that he bends to get under me &mdash; but my muscle memory is far faster. I lower myself further than he can, sliding beneath the pole, driving my metallic shoulder into his chest and blasting him in the air.</p><p>&emsp;He lets out a rasping wheeze when his ribs bend towards his lungs. He&apos;s lucky that nothing inside him breaks: maybe it&apos;s the alcohol on his breath that hints that his muscles are loose, and that he&apos;s feeling a little braver than he might be otherwise.  Cody crashes against my wall, leaving a sizable divot in the aged wallpaper, and before the ground reclaims him, I manage to snag the greatsword with my left hand, dragging it across the floor to assume a defensive stance. </p><p>&emsp;Somehow, he still manages to death-grip the broom between his hands, coughing and gasping for air as he lifts himself to his feet, overflowing with adrenaline and rage that radiate in his reddening face.</p><p>&emsp;I realize I left him an opening to escape. I expect him to cower, retreating to his conjured illusion to never return. But he flips the broom end of the stick to face him, exposing a sharp, hollow edge. </p><p>&emsp;His hapless courage is admirable. Maybe I would have fallen for him if this were training, and we were on the same side of the war.</p><p>&emsp;Cody coughs. &quot;You couldn&apos;t just let me go, could you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I need to be sure you can&apos;t ever ruin my peace again.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He takes several labored breaths, clutching his chest, swinging the sharp end of the broom in several circles. &quot;So you&apos;re trying to kill me, then?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not my fault that you broke in.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I was trying to tell you that the door was open. What the hell kind of neighbor are you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re not strong enough to be my neighbor,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;The ceiling has just enough clearance to swing the greatsword in a vertical slash. I expect this cumbersome move to give him enough of a start to really escape this time, but he still refuses, standing there with the stick between his hands. </p><p>&emsp;The sword traces a faint line in the wooden ceiling before gravity does the rest of the work. It clashes with the broom &mdash; and I fully expect it to break through &mdash; but all my greatsword does is well a deep notch in the hexagonal shaft.</p><p>&emsp;He mutters something about the material, cursing about how this broom is personal to him, but I know very little of the Auvrya or their traditions. My blade releases sparks when I try to pull it back, grinding against the notch, but the further I pull, the higher the blade climbs. </p><p>&emsp;I hear the screech of metal-on-metal, and it seems it&apos;s his turn to close the distance. He grinds the pole against the sharp edge, driving the sword higher and higher until it falls behind my hands. I&apos;m left defenseless, and he jabs the plastic head of the stick against my breastplate, driving me to the floor.</p>"

        "<p id=\"1.9.2.30\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Something loud is approaching. I try to curl into a ball to protect myself, but the armor stiffens me too much. A massive automobile tears past, lighting the entire street with headlamps lodged in the front, unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen. It sounds like they have an entire orchestra in there behind the glass, but the deafening music fades . . . only to be replaced by two more loud metal chariots that shake the ground.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.9.2.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I&apos;m quivering as I lay there in the grass, wondering where the garden is; why the lake isn&apos;t directly across from me; why stars shifted in the sky so swiftly. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.9.2.32\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;An old woman walks on the side of the street, and I consider she&apos;s a lamplighter until I see her holding a leash. She notices me crumpled in the grass on the verge of tears.</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.9.2.37\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m a human person. A living human&mdash;&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.9.2.39\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I haven&apos;t the time to protest when I hear a hissing noise, and it sounds like the elder is conjuring a serpent. Before I can react, I feel a cloudless rain, followed by a direct blast of water to my face, saturating the clothes beneath my armor in seconds.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.9.2.40\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Why? Why do you torment me?&quot; I plead, my tears now inseparable from the water soaking me down to my underwear. </p>",

        "<p id=\"1.9.2.42\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;As I kneel in the muddy grass, sullying my new pants, I watch as the cantankerous woman retreats, dragging the mutt alongside her. A single, white moon hangs in the sky. Blinking red and white flashes somewhere even higher, casting smoke in a faint line, leaving the sound of a crackle as it slices the sky. I never knew the sky could be torn. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.9.2.43\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;With my mind petrified, locking my muscles, resigning me to soak in the jets of water, my body decides for me, urging me back inside to pass Cody&apos;s cursing companion.</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.9.2.45\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I ignore his companion&apos;s threat to take shots, though he holds a bottle instead of a gun, &mdash; asking if his friend paid for any more guards to defend this house.

        "<p id=\"1.9.4.5\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I charge with my armored left shoulder, allowing the Essence to flow into my legs, flooding my muscles with such power that every step deflects the floorboards. I close the distance faster than he expects, but he remains steadfast, standing there with the metal broom raised to chest height, hinging his arms to receive the full force of my momentum.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.9.4.6\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;It&apos;s when I&apos;m three steps from deliverance that he bends to get under me &mdash; but my muscle memory is far faster. I lower myself further than he can, sliding beneath the pole, driving my metallic shoulder into his chest and blasting him in the air.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.9.4.7\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He lets out a rasping wheeze when his ribs bend towards his lungs. He&apos;s lucky that nothing inside him breaks: maybe it&apos;s the alcohol on his breath that hints that his muscles are loose, and that he&apos;s feeling a little braver than he might be otherwise.  Cody crashes against my wall, leaving a sizable divot in the aged wallpaper, and before the ground reclaims him, I manage to snag the greatsword with my left hand, dragging it across the floor to assume a defensive stance. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.9.4.8\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Somehow, he still manages to death-grip the broom between his hands, coughing and gasping for air as he lifts himself to his feet, overflowing with adrenaline and rage that radiate in his reddening face.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.9.4.9\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I realize I left him an opening to escape. I expect him to cower, retreating to his conjured illusion to never return. But he flips the broom end of the stick to face him, exposing a sharp, hollow edge. </p>",

        "<p id=\"1.9.4.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The ceiling has just enough clearance to swing the greatsword in a vertical slash. I expect this cumbersome move to give him enough of a start to really escape this time, but he still refuses, standing there with the stick between his hands. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.9.4.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The sword traces a faint line in the wooden ceiling before gravity does the rest of the work.

        "<p id=\"1.9.4.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I hear the screech of metal-on-metal, and it seems it&apos;s his turn to close the distance. He grinds the pole against the sharp edge, driving the sword higher and higher until it falls behind my hands. I&apos;m left defenseless, and he jabs the plastic head of the stick against my breastplate, driving me to the floor.</p>"

      "<p>&emsp;Whatever that thing is, it isn&apos;t a broom.</p><p>&emsp;My mind races, but I still manage to remember the bloody dagger in the sink.</p><p>&emsp;I roll behind the kitchen island as he brandishes the head of the stick against a wooden bowl on the counter, casting a whole slew of produce against the ground.</p><p>&emsp;I lift myself by the counter&apos;s edge to dig my hand into the sink, feeling for the hilt of the dagger. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Your fight is with me, not the damn house!&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;He bends down to scoop up one of the apples with the stick, taking it into the basket. I level the dagger at him, taking a butcher&apos;s knife in my other hand, completely unsure of what he&apos;s going to do next.</p><p>&emsp;His hands shift to the sharp end of the stick, leaving the basket at a certain length behind him. </p><p>&emsp;Then he whips it down as hard as he can. </p><p>&emsp;The apple whizzes past my head, exploding against the stone wall, casting chunks of its sugary flesh and skin into my hair.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I should have practiced since the club team sophomore year,&quot; he says, slurring his words. &quot;Next one&apos;s going corner-pocket in your damn eye socket.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not if I end you first,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;The assassin scoops up an orange with a single flick of his wrist. I ready the knife block. He launches a second one, but I&apos;m quick enough to slice it with my dagger before it blasts me in the forehead. </p><p>&emsp;My eyes burn with the citrus, and when I think he&apos;s reeling to throw something harder &mdash; like a pear or another apple &mdash; squinting as I wipe the juice with my dagger hand, I use my unpracticed off hand to flick the kitchen knife through the air.</p><p>&emsp;It spins several times before embedding itself into the wall behind him. He freezes. I set the dagger on the counter, taking three more kitchen knives into my left hand, certain that I can hit dead-center now that my dominant hand is free.</p><p>&emsp;I whip a second one, letting the Essence tension the fibers of my muscles, launching the paring knife faster than an arrow. </p><p>&emsp;But he&apos;s already pitching up the overturned kitchen table. </p><p>&emsp;The tablecloth hovers to the floor like melting ectoplasm before the paring knife pins it to the table. Cody lets out a yelp in fear, surely unhurt since the blade is far shallower than the thick mahogany. </p><p>&emsp;I decide to upgrade to a carving knife, withdrawing all five inches from the block. I judge its balance. </p><p>&emsp;He peeks from behind the table, and I whip the carving knife where I expect his chest to be, thinking it&apos;s his body that braces the table upright. </p><p>&emsp;But he bends back. </p><p>&emsp;It stabs through almost up to the handle.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Holy hell,&quot; he exclaims.</p><p>&emsp;I wind up to throw another as he pulls the small knife from the wallpaper, then throw it. The boring knife spins through the air, nearly pinning his hand to the wall. He catches me off guard when he emerges from the side of the table. I reach for another culinary weapon, but I realize my offhand is out of blades.</p><p>&emsp;The oddly-dressed assassin flips the blade to set the sharp edge between his fingers, his eyes dark and piercing as he raises his elbow and lifts the knife behind his head. The panic seizes my heart: this assassin&apos;s skilled enough to engage a vetted Royal Guard when he&apos;s two sheets to the wind. I&apos;m certain a knife will soon be in my chest, and all I can do is ready myself for the deliverance of cold steel.</p><p>&emsp;And then he throws it.</p><p>&emsp;I expect it to fly so fast that I can&apos;t catch a glimpse of its glistening edge before it embeds itself between my breastplate. I expect my consciousness to end, to wash in the next fated moment upon the Reservoir of Souls. </p><p>&emsp;But I can see it.</p><p>&emsp;And it&apos;s not coming at me.</p><p>&emsp;It flies so far to the right that I wonder if he&apos;s aiming at something else. The paring knife spins horizontally through the air, twirling and spinning with such disarray that it only makes it halfway to the kitchen before it clatters against the floor.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Damn it!&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;The laugh escapes before my hands cover my mouth. I can&apos;t even stop the loud snort. His face is crestfallen, even more hurt than the time I rammed him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You should stick with that strange basket-stick of yours,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;Cody&apos;s voice wavers. &quot;It&apos;s called a lacrosse stick,&quot; he says, blushing hard, peeking over the edge with his glasses as he struggles to withdraw the carving knife from the other side. </p><p>&emsp;I thought he was an Auvryan mind-flayer &mdash; a mythical master of mental manipulation, maybe commissioned by the Chymaera. But he&apos;s no warrior. Just a stupidly-brave commoner that&apos;s overconfident in his skills. And a complete idiot.</p><p>&emsp;I can&apos;t stop laughing. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What are you, some kind of combat janitor? Do you sweep floors with that thing?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;His face reddens further, whether it&apos;s the booze, his humiliation, or both.  I feel the relief wash over me as the Essence retreats from my circuits. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Gods above, for a second I thought you were an actual threat,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Who says I&apos;m not?&quot; He scoops a tomato into the &apos;cross stick&apos;, poised to whip another one.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just . . . stop,&quot; I tell him. &quot;I&apos;m not going to kill a civilian.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe you should reconsider,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Consider this.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I raise my hands and cast a controlled plume of flames. He flinches when they stop only inches from his face, dropping something hard and small from his pocket. He has to steady himself with the odd weapon as he stumbles towards the closet.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Really, Cody. Do you even understand our training? How much Essence a Royal Guard is conditioned with? How much mead does it take to get this kind of courage? I could snap your bones with my hands!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m your neighbor. I live right next door . . . through there,&quot; he says, lifting a bare arm exposed by his scalded shirt to point towards the closet. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why are you living in the military district?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I live in Hearthland Ridge,&quot; he insists. &quot;The military base is down in Cheyenne, or maybe Fort Carson.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is Gaffesend,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, this is Colorado. The United States,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nothing is united in all of Fosroth. You can&apos;t be stupid enough to be a tourist at the war front!&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The war is overseas. It&apos;s fought with drones and bombs.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s waged with swords and rifles!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I approach him until I can smell the booze on his breath. My eyes flutter between his exposed chest and his arms, a little impressed at his definition when he obviously has no Essence. I catch him glimpsing at my bare thighs that once straddled him, and then to my breastplate, before returning my glare and slowly backing up towards the closet.</p><p>&emsp;But his heels catch on the threshold.</p><p>&emsp;He falls through the portal, unable to steady himself with his weapon before he crashes to the ground on the other side. I take one more glance at the horrors of that incomprehensible world: all its glistening, colored lights like Essenced lightning bugs. The fear forestalls me from passing that threshold ever again, so I stand there: watching; waiting; listening to the faintness of his breath; until I&apos;m certain his intemperance will keep him there.</p><p>&emsp;But the fear of that other world overpowers my penchant for patience. I slam the door behind him, certain I&apos;ll never have to face that stranger again.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I dig my heels into the space between the floorboards, catching my breath as I drive my back against the closet door. My nails tension against the pad of my palm, leaving crescents in my flesh as the blood drains from my fingertips. </p><p>&emsp;My heart can only take so much in a day. I thought the enemy could only strike when my presence was voluntary; when I patrol the borders of Gaffesend by my own volition. And it only took a day for this peaceful haven to be violated by a stranger.</p><p>&emsp;I can&apos;t keep sitting here. The curse will catch me if I don&apos;t get up: the white feeling that tensions my hands and sets my body in full static.  The shorter the time between those moments of frantic stillness, the easier it slides into that incontrovertible state of shock. It&apos;s addiction without a pleasure to be addicted to, and the more often that white feeling haunts me, the stronger it gets &mdash; so I&apos;m glad when I find my effects are still scattered across the floor. A mess to clean is the second-best thing to distract me right now: the first is going to the bar, but after my episode, I&apos;d rather not be seen in public.</p><p>&emsp;I let my mind flow with visions of how I can transform this space into a place of respite, rather than feeling like an ephemeral halfway-house between training and the front lines.  The mind is a vessel that can only hold so much at a time, so I drink to the the purity of those beautiful thoughts, driving down the opacity of fear&apos;s murky brine. The pale white feeling fades as the light begins to shine through, reaching my furthest depths.</p><p>&emsp;When my hands stave off the static, I gather the courage to seal that passageway forever. </p><p>&emsp;I let the Essence flood my circuits with enough heat to melt the handle of the closet door to the deadbolt, ensuring it&apos;s locked forever. Then I drag an empty bookcase across the floor to cover it. It irritates me that it&apos;s slightly spaced from the wall due to the protrusion of the melted handle, so I melt the rest of it, turning the balled handle into a flat plate pressed against the profile of the wooden door, deciding it&apos;s good enough to try to forget.</p><p>&emsp;I lack the Auvryan magic of mind, but I hypnotize myself anyway. </p><p>&emsp;The bookcase has always been here.</p><p>&emsp;Next, I purge anything that reminds me of him. </p><p>&emsp;I wipe his blood from the dagger. I return the fruit scattered across the floor into the bowl. I pull the kitchen knives from the overturned table and reset the tablecloth the other way around, covering the gaping holes in the wood. Finding the evidence is still in the fabric, I sew the clean cuts in the tablecloth closed with thread from my sewing kit. I mop and dab all the puddles and smudges. This leads to finding places for the hundred pounds of my unpacked personal items, placing them anywhere but the closet I should have forgotten, which leads to re-orienting all the decorations and furniture and bookshelf to make the space my own, which leads to dusting every surface I can find. Before long, I find my exasperated body sprawled across the kitchen&apos;s area rug, drugged by the excitement of exertion, staring at the cross-beams of the low wooden ceiling with a slight smile on my face. </p><p>&emsp;I hoped so dearly that this distraction would let me forget. </p><p>&emsp;But even still, I find the urge to reconcile that impossibility.</p><p>&emsp;I need to keep moving. I need to find something to fix when I can&apos;t leave this house. Since I can&apos;t patch the dent in the wall, I decide to look harder for any dust that might coalesce beneath the cabinets. I roll over to find the duster did its job well, but there&apos;s something else tucked under there.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s a strange, slender, rectangular object beneath the cutout of the kitchen cabinet. Like all the other things in his realm, it&apos;s perfectly smooth and square &mdash; but I can tell it&apos;s been worn from years and years of continuous use. It would look like an ingot if it wasn&apos;t so flat: hardly enough for a blacksmith to smelt it into anything. When I turn the heavy block in my hands, I find that I&apos;m able to read the foreign words on the back, etched in white beneath an image of a bitten fruit:</p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>LOVE YOU JACKIE D</span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>FROM CODY 2010</span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>MERRY CHRISTMAS</span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>160 GB</span></p><p>&emsp;A set of long, slender wires snake from the bottom of it, ending with white buds that look like they could grow into flowers. Does it work with electricity? Because it&apos;s certainly not plugged in to anything.</p><p>&emsp;A light tug pulls out the buds by their roots. I panic for a second until I realize I&apos;ll never have to return this thing to him. </p><p>&emsp;When I jam the buds&apos; metal root back into the hole, the dark square on the front turns on, glowing with an impossible, radiant white, labeled with options in black. </p><p>&emsp;It takes me a while to figure it out, but when my finger glides on the circle, the little window changes. I settle the black bar on PICTURES, expecting a photograph to dispense from the tiny slot in the bottom. </p><p>&emsp;I press the center button. </p><p>&emsp;But instead, the window shows a gateway to an entirely different world. It reminds me of the moving projections that I heard were in the theatre rooms of the capital, though this one is so impossibly small &mdash; and there&apos;s not a creature in existence that could roll the image from inside. It reminds me of the screaming woman behind the window on the stranger&apos;s wall.</p><p>&emsp;There&apos;s so many tiny squares of color that make this picture, but it&apos;s still hard to make out. Two people sit at a table in a stone-walled room lit by a very bright lamp. One is small: just a boy, and the other is older, wearing some kind of green-and-brown uniform &mdash; sharp enough in dress that I figure he&apos;s a warrior.</p><p>&emsp;All I can tell is that they care for each other: sitting together building something metallic and square with wires hanging off of it. And they have this same device there, sharing the white buds between their ears. </p><p>&emsp;I try the same with the round white shapes, but nothing happens. I click another button on the side. The screen goes black, reflecting my eyes on its worn, yet polished surface, and when I realize how time has passed, I look up at the hands of the clock. </p><p>&emsp;Dear Gods above: a whole hour has passed. If I don&apos;t sleep now, dusk will overtake any chance of rest.</p><p>&emsp;I run upstairs with the device in my hand, leaving the square pod and its tangled wires as the first decoration on my nightstand. My body is exhausted from all the fear, and I don&apos;t have to even draw the covers to find myself in slumber. I just collapse onto the bed, retreating into a deep sleep where the smoke of the cabin across the lake never reaches me.</p><p>&emsp;My mind remembers the contours of Cody&apos;s body beneath the tattered shirt. I can&apos;t escape the thought in my dreams, no matter how much physical or mental furniture I pile against the sealed door.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I wake to a rapping on my door, but it&apos;s not the rhythm of the personal knocker. When I dip my head out the window, I find Bertram standing on the top step.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re up early,&quot; I say. I slept in my plainclothes, so I don&apos;t have to hide behind the curtain. &quot; I don&apos;t even think the knocker is awake yet.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He tilts his head up at me. &quot;Sorry to wake you. I figure we might want to get started early if we&apos;re returning those quest forms.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Sure. I&apos;ll be out in a minute,&quot; I tell him, rushing through a minimal routine, ensuring I look &quot;royal&quot; enough for the Royal Guard.</p><p>&emsp;When I descend the stairs into the immaculate foyer, the smell of bread confirms it&apos;s going to be another quick morning without cracking a can of rations. I pinch twenty Kine from my coin purse and pass it out the back window.</p><p>&emsp;Another voice rises from the front of the flat. And then another one. And after I dress myself in light armor for another day of chores, I throw open the door to find two others have joined us.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian stands behind Bertram with Oriya, and he offers an explanation I never asked for. &quot;She wanted to join us on the walk over, she asked me last night. We&apos;re right next to each other, anyways.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh,&quot; I tell him. </p><p>&emsp;Oriya turns her head.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m surprised you never stopped by to check on me,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We were out late, past midnight, looking at only a few hours of slumber. I didn&apos;t want to wake you since you were sick, I figured you were long asleep,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;But you certainly could have made it a lot better.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian offers his hand. I tension my fingers between his, looking for a squeeze of reassurance.</p><p>&emsp;He returns one.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I really could have used you last night,&quot; I tell him. You&apos;re never comfortable with the concept of staying.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just knew that if I was there, neither one of us would have slept at all,&quot; he says, returning a smile. &quot;And you were feeling ill, so you needed all the rest you could get.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess.&quot; I turn my head to watch in amusement as Oriya and Bertram struggle to overcome the most basic conversational hurdle.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But I really wish you were there last night,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;There was hardly anything for us to do. From what all the senior guards say, it seems like junior scouting missions carry light expectations. If that&apos;s as bad as it gets, then this will be a whole lot easier than all the training that led up to it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s nice,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And we all got to know each other a lot better than any other night out,&quot; Oriya says. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Did you?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Oriya says. &quot;You and Bertram should join us next time!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; I say, tensioning my fingers further against Jullian&apos;s hand.</p><p>&emsp;Oriya decides to continue. &quot;I&apos;ve talked to Jullian a lot, but not you, Katiya,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;I say, &quot;I guess our paths never really crossed. Even in field training.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Oriya looks at my boyfriend. &quot;Tell me, how is it that you two met?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I open my mouth to answer, but I hesitate, starving for a small sliver of reassurance. I want to know that he remembers. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why don&apos;t you tell her, Jullian?&quot; I ask. I think he&apos;ll stammer for a second, but he&apos;s quick, so much that it almost sounds rehearsed.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. It was because we had one thing in common,&quot; Jullian says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot; Oriya asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We were both dirt poor.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Oriya narrows her brows. &quot;Really? I never would have guessed.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s true,&quot; I say. &quot;When my brother Erik was sent to Gaffesend, and I was in the last year of training, I had to take up Erik&apos;s share of responsibilities. Our mother was busy on the looms in the factory.&quot; I turn to Jullian, prodding further. &quot;And the day we met?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah &mdash; we were taking night classes because we both worked during the day. It was the second-to-last semester, late one night when I was returning from an exam. I had to take my brother to the academy because I was watching him, and as we&apos;re walking home, he sees this beautiful girl passing us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How old was your brother?&quot; Oriya asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He was eight,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;Anyways, I must have been ranting to him about how little time I have for anything, because, get this &mdash; he walks straight up to her, tugs on her shirt, and says, &apos;Hey lady: my brother is lonely and sad: can you fix him?&apos;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Really?&quot; Oriya turns to me. &quot;And that worked on you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess so,&quot; I say. &quot;I have little half-siblings, too, so I guess I have a soft spot for that impudence. There wasn&apos;t really anyone there for me at the time, and with so much coming after graduation, I was willing to give him a chance.&quot; I only realize what I implied when I look to Bertram.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian says, &quot;I was a loner. I thought I wasn&apos;t worthy, that I was a loser, that nothing would ever work out for me. But Katiya blessed me with something I&apos;d never felt before. And sometimes I&apos;m still not sure I deserve it.&quot; I think he intends it as a joke, but there&apos;s just enough substance that it makes the others feel uncomfortable.</p><p>&emsp;It makes me feel so warm when I remember how great he was with my two half-siblings. How he&apos;d wait for me every night after classes, and we&apos;d stay up until the morning just talking about our lives, until a couple months passed and we were brave enough to explore something else in each other. </p><p>&emsp;But he almost looks sad sharing these memories: holding the same expression on his face I found when we drew closer to graduation, when after challenging each other for months and months to be at our best, we climbed the ranks high enough to be withheld from direct service. It was on the week-long trip to Gaffesend that I saw the biggest change. Before that, he was right on the threshold of opening up, but after a week with his first group of guy friends, following them around to pubs in every layover town on the way to Gaffe, he started to feel colder, almost as distant as when I first met him and had to warm him up.</p><p>&emsp;I still find his eyes wander to other faces when we walk together, even right now, gaging reactions, forever looking for something he can&apos;t find. But with all the wonderful times we shared together, how far we opened up to each other, I&apos;m certain that it&apos;s still there, regardless of how the conditions have changed.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re still so young,&quot; he mutters, just between the two of us.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know,&quot; I tell him. &quot;How is that relevant?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He pauses, as if he meant to think it. &quot;But my future is always with you.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;The familiar nervous tick rises where he scratches at his arms. I still wait to hear those three words. We were so close before it felt like graduation changed everything, and part of me wishes we started earlier.</p><p>&emsp;We approach the quest board outside the re-purposed adventurer&apos;s guild building, swarming with junior guards. We submit our forms from yesterday for a sign-off. I apologize to Bertram, though he insists he knows what I meant, and I offer for the two of us to take on a quest together.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I think we should do a scouting quest together,&quot; he says. &quot;How about a close one?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Jullian overhears us as he talks with his friends. I can tell he&apos;s trying to mask that he&apos;s actively listening.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not sure,&quot; I say. &quot;I think we should do something close.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is the chance to take that next step, you know. I know we can do it. You and me, together. Nothing&apos;s going to happen.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not today,&quot; I say, &quot;but next time. I assure you. I just don&apos;t think I&apos;m ready yet.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Even during the day?&quot; Bertram asks. I can feel his disappointment weigh on my self-image. &quot;It&apos;s just the other bank. Please, no more potato harvesting: my nails need a damn rest.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then scouting the city?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But in the forest, you can actually sit down most of the time. Make camp and relax, as long as you&apos;re quiet enough to listen.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sure, but&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He pauses, realizing how his insistence weighs on me. &quot;No. No, it&apos;s fine,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m wrong. I&apos;m sorry to push you. We can&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s alright, Bertram. I&apos;ll take one of the domestic quests alone: you go ahead.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, but . . . are you sure?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sure,&quot; I say, watching his bright blue eyes fill with hesitation, though I&apos;ve known him long enough to tell when there&apos;s something he really wants. &quot;Really. Go on, I&apos;ll catch up with you after.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;O-okay, then,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe tomorrow, then?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; and then I add, &quot;Maybe. Sure.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The masses begin moving for the shoreline to catch a boat across the lake. Julian stops me as I turn with the few stragglers heading for the mainland.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d really like it if you&apos;d come with us,&quot; he says. The group of guys and girls look impatient, beginning to suspect something&apos;s off about me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s alright. I&apos;d rather do stuff closer to home,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay?&quot; I almost expected more of a fight, more of an effort towards persuasion, but he turns to join the receding group before I have a chance to protest. Oriya is the only one waiting for him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll catch up with you later,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; I mutter. But he&apos;s already too far away to hear it. I look down at the quest sheet I tore from behind all the other postings, wondering where this shameful feeling of unease will deposit me today.</p>"

I&apos;m certain a knife will soon be in my chest, and all I can do is ready myself for the deliverance of cold steel.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.1.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;And then he throws it.</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.10.1.30\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Damn it!&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.1.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The laugh escapes before my hands cover my mouth. I can&apos;t even stop the loud snort. His face is crestfallen, even more hurt than the time I rammed him.</p>",

My eyes flutter between his exposed chest and his arms, a little impressed at his definition when he obviously has no Essence.

The fear forestalls me from passing that threshold ever again, so I stand there: watching; waiting; listening to the faintness of his breath; until I&apos;m certain his intemperance will keep him there.</p>",

It&apos;s addiction without a pleasure to be addicted to, and the more often that white feeling haunts me, the stronger it gets &mdash; so I&apos;m glad when I find my effects are still scattered across the floor.

It irritates me that it&apos;s slightly spaced from the wall due to the protrusion of the melted handle, so I melt the rest of it, turning the balled handle into a flat plate pressed against the profile of the wooden door, deciding it&apos;s good enough to try to forget.</p>",

I pull the kitchen knives from the overturned table and reset the tablecloth the other way around, covering the gaping holes in the wood. Finding the evidence is still in the fabric, I sew the clean cuts in the tablecloth closed with thread from my sewing kit. I mop and dab all the puddles and smudges. This leads to finding places for the hundred pounds of my unpacked personal items, placing them anywhere but the closet I should have forgotten, which leads to re-orienting all the decorations and furniture and bookshelf to make the space my own, which leads to dusting every surface I can find. Before long, I find my exasperated body sprawled across the kitchen&apos;s area rug, drugged by the excitement of exertion, staring at the cross-beams of the low wooden ceiling with a slight smile on my face. </p>",

I roll over to find the duster did its job well, but there&apos;s something else tucked under there.</p>",

Like all the other things in his realm, it&apos;s perfectly smooth and square &mdash; but I can tell it&apos;s been worn from years and years of continuous use. It would look like an ingot if it wasn&apos;t so flat: hardly enough for a blacksmith to smelt it into anything. When I turn the heavy block in my hands, I find that I&apos;m able to read the foreign words on the back, etched in white beneath an image of a bitten fruit:</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.10.2.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;A set of long, slender wires snake from the bottom of it, ending with white buds that look like they could grow into flowers. Does it work with electricity? Because it&apos;s certainly not plugged in to anything.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.2.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;A light tug pulls out the buds by their roots. I panic for a second until I realize I&apos;ll never have to return this thing to him. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.2.21\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;When I jam the buds&apos; metal root back into the hole, the dark square on the front turns on, glowing with an impossible, radiant white, labeled with options in black. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.2.22\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;It takes me a while to figure it out, but when my finger glides on the circle, the little window changes. I settle the black bar on PICTURES, expecting a photograph to dispense from the tiny slot in the bottom. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.2.23\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I press the center button. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.2.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But instead, the window shows a gateway to an entirely different world. It reminds me of the moving projections that I heard were in the theatre rooms of the capital, though this one is so impossibly small &mdash; and there&apos;s not a creature in existence that could roll the image from inside. It reminds me of the screaming woman behind the window on the stranger&apos;s wall.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.2.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;There&apos;s so many tiny squares of color that make this picture, but it&apos;s still hard to make out. Two people sit at a table in a stone-walled room lit by a very bright lamp. One is small: just a boy, and the other is older, wearing some kind of green-and-brown uniform &mdash; sharp enough in dress that I figure he&apos;s a warrior.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.2.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;All I can tell is that they care for each other: sitting together building something metallic and square with wires hanging off of it. And they have this same device there, sharing the white buds between their ears. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.2.27\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I try the same with the round white shapes, but nothing happens. I click another button on the side. The screen goes black, reflecting my eyes on its worn, yet polished surface, and when I realize how time has passed, I look up at the hands of the clock. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.2.28\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Dear Gods above: a whole hour has passed. If I don&apos;t sleep now, dusk will overtake any chance of rest.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.2.29\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I run upstairs with the device in my hand, leaving the square pod and its tangled wires as the first decoration on my nightstand. My body is exhausted from all the fear, and I don&apos;t have to even draw the covers to find myself in slumber. I just collapse onto the bed, retreating into a deep sleep where the smoke of the cabin across the lake never reaches me.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.2.30\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My mind remembers the contours of Cody&apos;s body beneath the tattered shirt. I can&apos;t escape the thought in my dreams, no matter how much physical or mental furniture I pile against the sealed door.</p>"

        "<p id=\"1.10.3.2\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re up early,&quot; I say. I slept in my plainclothes, so I don&apos;t have to hide behind the curtain. &quot; I don&apos;t even think the knocker is awake yet.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.3\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He tilts his head up at me. &quot;Sorry to wake you. I figure we might want to get started early if we&apos;re returning those quest forms.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.4\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Sure. I&apos;ll be out in a minute,&quot; I tell him, rushing through a minimal routine, ensuring I look &quot;royal&quot; enough for the Royal Guard.</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.10.3.7\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Jullian stands behind Bertram with Oriya, and he offers an explanation I never asked for. &quot;She wanted to join us on the walk over, she asked me last night. We&apos;re right next to each other, anyways.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.10.3.11\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;We were out late, past midnight, looking at only a few hours of slumber. I didn&apos;t want to wake you since you were sick, I figured you were long asleep,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.12\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; I tell him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.13\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But you certainly could have made it a lot better.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Jullian offers his hand. I tension my fingers between his, looking for a squeeze of reassurance.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He returns one.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I really could have used you last night,&quot; I tell him. You&apos;re never comfortable with the concept of staying.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I just knew that if I was there, neither one of us would have slept at all,&quot; he says, returning a smile. &quot;And you were feeling ill, so you needed all the rest you could get.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I guess.&quot; I turn my head to watch in amusement as Oriya and Bertram struggle to overcome the most basic conversational hurdle.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But I really wish you were there last night,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;There was hardly anything for us to do. From what all the senior guards say, it seems like junior scouting missions carry light expectations. If that&apos;s as bad as it gets, then this will be a whole lot easier than all the training that led up to it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s nice,&quot; I tell him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.21\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And we all got to know each other a lot better than any other night out,&quot; Oriya says. </p>",

        "<p id=\"1.10.3.23\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Oriya says. &quot;You and Bertram should join us next time!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; I say, tensioning my fingers further against Jullian&apos;s hand.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Oriya decides to continue. &quot;I&apos;ve talked to Jullian a lot, but not you, Katiya,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I say, &quot;I guess our paths never really crossed. Even in field training.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.27\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Oriya looks at my boyfriend. &quot;Tell me, how is it that you two met?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.28\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I open my mouth to answer, but I hesitate, starving for a small sliver of reassurance. I want to know that he remembers. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.29\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Why don&apos;t you tell her, Jullian?&quot; I ask. I think he&apos;ll stammer for a second, but he&apos;s quick, so much that it almost sounds rehearsed.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.30\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Sure. It was because we had one thing in common,&quot; Jullian says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot; Oriya asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.32\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;We were both dirt poor.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.33\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Oriya narrows her brows. &quot;Really? I never would have guessed.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.34\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s true,&quot; I say. &quot;When my brother Erik was sent to Gaffesend, and I was in the last year of training, I had to take up Erik&apos;s share of responsibilities. Our mother was busy on the looms in the factory.&quot; I turn to Jullian, prodding further. &quot;And the day we met?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.35\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah &mdash; we were taking night classes because we both worked during the day. It was the second-to-last semester, late one night when I was returning from an exam. I had to take my brother to the academy because I was watching him, and as we&apos;re walking home, he sees this beautiful girl passing us.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.36\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;How old was your brother?&quot; Oriya asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.37\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;He was eight,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;Anyways, I must have been ranting to him about how little time I have for anything, because, get this &mdash; he walks straight up to her, tugs on her shirt, and says, &apos;Hey lady: my brother is lonely and sad: can you fix him?&apos;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.38\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Really?&quot; Oriya turns to me. &quot;And that worked on you?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.39\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I guess so,&quot; I say. &quot;I have little half-siblings, too, so I guess I have a soft spot for that impudence. There wasn&apos;t really anyone there for me at the time, and with so much coming after graduation, I was willing to give him a chance.&quot; I only realize what I implied when I look to Bertram.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.40\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Jullian says, &quot;I was a loner. I thought I wasn&apos;t worthy, that I was a loser, that nothing would ever work out for me. But Katiya blessed me with something I&apos;d never felt before. And sometimes I&apos;m still not sure I deserve it.&quot; I think he intends it as a joke, but there&apos;s just enough substance that it makes the others feel uncomfortable.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.41\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;It makes me feel so warm when I remember how great he was with my two half-siblings. How he&apos;d wait for me every night after classes, and we&apos;d stay up until the morning just talking about our lives, until a couple months passed and we were brave enough to explore something else in each other. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.42\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But he almost looks sad sharing these memories: holding the same expression on his face I found when we drew closer to graduation, when after challenging each other for months and months to be at our best, we climbed the ranks high enough to be withheld from direct service. It was on the week-long trip to Gaffesend that I saw the biggest change. Before that, he was right on the threshold of opening up, but after a week with his first group of guy friends, following them around to pubs in every layover town on the way to Gaffe, he started to feel colder, almost as distant as when I first met him and had to warm him up.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.43\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I still find his eyes wander to other faces when we walk together, even right now, gaging reactions, forever looking for something he can&apos;t find. But with all the wonderful times we shared together, how far we opened up to each other, I&apos;m certain that it&apos;s still there, regardless of how the conditions have changed.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.44\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re still so young,&quot; he mutters, just between the two of us.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.45\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I know,&quot; I tell him. &quot;How is that relevant?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.46\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He pauses, as if he meant to think it. &quot;But my future is always with you.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.47\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The familiar nervous tick rises where he scratches at his arms. I still wait to hear those three words. We were so close before it felt like graduation changed everything, and part of me wishes we started earlier.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.48\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We approach the quest board outside the re-purposed adventurer&apos;s guild building, swarming with junior guards. We submit our forms from yesterday for a sign-off. I apologize to Bertram, though he insists he knows what I meant, and I offer for the two of us to take on a quest together.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.49\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I think we should do a scouting quest together,&quot; he says. &quot;How about a close one?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.50\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Jullian overhears us as he talks with his friends. I can tell he&apos;s trying to mask that he&apos;s actively listening.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.51\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not sure,&quot; I say. &quot;I think we should do something close.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.52\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;This is the chance to take that next step, you know. I know we can do it. You and me, together. Nothing&apos;s going to happen.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.53\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Not today,&quot; I say, &quot;but next time. I assure you. I just don&apos;t think I&apos;m ready yet.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.54\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Even during the day?&quot; Bertram asks. I can feel his disappointment weigh on my self-image. &quot;It&apos;s just the other bank. Please, no more potato harvesting: my nails need a damn rest.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.55\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Then scouting the city?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.56\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But in the forest, you can actually sit down most of the time. Make camp and relax, as long as you&apos;re quiet enough to listen.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.57\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sure, but&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.58\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He pauses, realizing how his insistence weighs on me. &quot;No. No, it&apos;s fine,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m wrong. I&apos;m sorry to push you. We can&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.59\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s alright, Bertram. I&apos;ll take one of the domestic quests alone: you go ahead.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.60\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;No, but . . . are you sure?&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.61\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sure,&quot; I say, watching his bright blue eyes fill with hesitation, though I&apos;ve known him long enough to tell when there&apos;s something he really wants. &quot;Really. Go on, I&apos;ll catch up with you after.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.62\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;O-okay, then,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe tomorrow, then?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.63\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; and then I add, &quot;Maybe. Sure.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.64\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The masses begin moving for the shoreline to catch a boat across the lake. Julian stops me as I turn with the few stragglers heading for the mainland.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.65\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d really like it if you&apos;d come with us,&quot; he says. The group of guys and girls look impatient, beginning to suspect something&apos;s off about me.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.66\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s alright. I&apos;d rather do stuff closer to home,&quot; I tell him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.67\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; he says. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.68\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Okay?&quot; I almost expected more of a fight, more of an effort towards persuasion, but he turns to join the receding group before I have a chance to protest. Oriya is the only one waiting for him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.69\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll catch up with you later,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.10.3.70\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; I mutter. But he&apos;s already too far away to hear it. I look down at the quest sheet I tore from behind all the other postings, wondering where this shameful feeling of unease will deposit me today.</p>"

      "<p>&emsp;Late Sunday morning, around 11:00, I awoke with my neck twisted against the closet door, my face saturated with drool, shirt missing, and a sticky note taped to my forehead with Miguel&apos;s handwriting that read &quot;DRINK WATER.&quot; The pounding headache had mostly subsided: I must have slept it off, or drank loads of water the night before from how quickly I immediately had to sprint to the restroom. And after relieving myself, I found my phone on the counter with three unread texts:</p><p><span class=msgfromdate>Miguel Ruelas // 06:37</span></p><p><span class=msgfrom>u gotta tell me whassup with that wack cosplay chick. neighbor? break-in? u invite rollplay hookers over when i was asleep?</span></p><p><span class=msgfromdate>Miguel Ruelas // 07:13</span></p><p><span class=msgfrom>or shit maybe I dreamt it, doesnt explain the bruise on my leg unless something happened that i forgot</span></p><p><span class=msgfromdate>Miguel Ruelas // 07:14</span></p><p><span class=msgfrom>anyways congrats bro on the house. lets catch up next week im off to church. cleaned up some of the mess. love u bro</span></p><p>&emsp;I looked around to find that the madman actually cleaned everything. The pillows were arranged on the couch, the beer cans sorted into the recycling bin outside, and even the counters looked like he gave them a clean wipe. I responded: </p><p><span class=msgtodate>Cody Dunsmore // 11:12</span></p><p><span class=msgto>Thanks for cleaning up dude, you didn&apos;t have to do that! Let&apos;s chill next weekend. Not much else to do when everyone moved away :/</span></p><p>&emsp;Feeling disgusting, I rushed upstairs to take a shower, getting off the sweat and stench of a failed all-nigher. My shower thoughts brought me back to that dream in another world: getting slashed by a crazy roleplayer and encountering strangers in some semi-modern renaissance world. I looked down at my left hand, as if the warm shower water wasn&apos;t enough to tell me whether or not the flesh parted like a bad haircut. But all I found was smooth skin. </p><p>&emsp;It must have been a shared dream, like Inception, because I still don&apos;t recall inviting anyone over: hell, I don&apos;t even know who to call. But as the scalding water relieves the pounding in my head, I find that all I can think of is the magical woman I fought in my dreams, how she straddled me, threw knives at me, and cleaved that heavy greatsword straight into the middle of my lacrosse stick. </p><p>&emsp;I dried myself off before a different kind of pleasure could emerge from those thoughts: I was more absorbed by the strangeness of that vivid and continuous dream. My curiosity led me to try opening the door to the closet, finding another door behind it that looked as if its handle were blasted with a blowtorch. </p><p>&emsp;I just assumed I&apos;d forgotten there was no closet. Were these pre-builds originally intended for a hotel chain or something with the neighbor door? It didn&apos;t make sense at all, but I knew I wouldn&apos;t feel safe, and I was actively looking for any kind of excuse to make something stupid in my robotics workshop. </p><p>&emsp;After a drive-thru breakfast, I went to the home improvement store to get one of those school-shooter-stopping door stops: one level shy of something permanent like bolting the damn door in place. With a spare microcontroller, I hooked up a hall-effect sensor and a buzzer &mdash; a magnet sensor and a loud speaker, basically &mdash; to detect if that door was ever to move. By soldering the wires to the breadboard, along with some AA batteries, and using generous dollops of hot glue to stick it to the inside wall of the strange-looking door, I called it a day around 9:30 PM, returning to my bed for an early night of sleep so I could get up tomorrow, only to spend four hours doom-scrolling through the week&apos;s sordid politics. </p><p>&emsp;I consider all these details right now when I&apos;m driving ten over the speed limit. It&apos;s not wondering if the notched cut in my lacrosse stick was from when Miguel and I were drunkenly tossing a tennis ball outside, nor is it my missing iPod Classic. It&apos;s how I could have possibly screwed myself over this bad. </p><p>&emsp;I set three alarms. Either my dumb ass shut them off in succession, I slept through them, or I did bad math in figuring out the absolute latest I could wake up, forgetting that I had to take a shower. Now I&apos;m screaming down the highway, hating myself as I KNOW that I&apos;m going to either make it right on time or a couple minutes too late. </p><p>&emsp;I skipped breakfast when that ulcerous, cantankerous feeling arrested my stomach, running the numbers over and over and over about how long it would take me to get there. Now I calculate every second as I pull into the last roadway snaking up into the canyon, taking tight turns that jostle my backpack against the back seat, nearly screeching my tires when I pull up to the front gate. </p><p>&emsp;Eight fifty-three on the dashboard. </p><p>&emsp;The gate guard waves me through. Apparently two years is long enough for him to remember my face. I clip the badge to my wrinkled work shirt and gather my bag when my Subaru fits in the last spot available, sneaking in the back door. </p><p>&emsp;Eight fifty-eight. </p><p>&emsp;I sneak in with the technicians finishing their first union-mandated break. The ones I worked with make fun of me for being lazy, calling me an &quot;eighter-skater&quot;. </p><p>&emsp;Eight fifty-nine. </p><p>&emsp;I climb the stairs. The rows of cubes are empty, and the sinking feeling deepens. What room is the meeting in? Was it thirty minutes earlier? I&apos;ll have to guess since I didn&apos;t check mail or Teams. </p><p>&emsp;Nine o&apos;clock. </p><p>&emsp;I try to calm my breathing or else I&apos;ll embarass myself further. Fuck, the door&apos;s shut. I open the door with a pad and paper in my other hand, meeting six sets of eyes as I retreat to the back, not a chair left for me to sit in. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Barely on time, Cody,&quot; Nav says. In the dark room, his face is only lit by the computer, and the window of emails is up on the projector. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I&mdash;&quot; don&apos;t add kindling to the fire by using an excuse: I find I&apos;m mostly out after this many years. </p><p>&emsp;Navesh continues. &quot;As I was saying. I swear to be transparent with all of you when it comes to this stuff. They monitor what they tell me, because they know I&apos;ll just regurgitate it back to all of you, because you deserve that honesty,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;Our team looks on with a knot in their stomachs: to my left, the Robinson-Monroe lifers Wilford Sameshima, a mechanical, and Michael Leguziamo, an electrical. To my right, Kei Sakurajima tensions her nails against her slender arm as she watches me for my own reaction, and mid-rank electrical Scott Valdez buries his face in his notepad. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;You all know the Aerospace Division was expecting the contract. Which means power cell assemblies to design, which means busy work making our existing models fit to their demands,&quot; Nav says. </p><p>&emsp;Kei types something into her open computer. My wrist vibrates when she hits the return key: </p><p><span class=msgfromdate>SAKURA_KEI 09:02:15:</span></p><p><span class=msgfrom>I thought I had tenure?</span></p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s an inside joke from when we had several electives together, when a professor was fired right in front of us. She cracks a smile that she fights to hide, trying to lighten the tension just a little. The humor joins the emotions inside my chest like adding oil to water, and not much for words right now, I respond. </p><p><span class=msgtodate>DUNSMO_COD 09:02:43:</span></p><p><span class=msgto>Guess not.</span></p><p>&emsp;Scott interjects, &quot;So when are we looking at here? For the . . . reduction of staff.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Even the lifers are afraid, tenured with all their tribal knowledge. Wilbur says, &quot;How many per group? I mean, we have a small team.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Nav predicates his next words with a warning. &quot;Now, I&apos;m not sure about any of this because they refuse to tell it straight. We&apos;re looking at one to two people, maybe. And we&apos;re looking at just before Christmas.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just in time to get gifts for my kids,&quot; I say, before realizing I&apos;ve spoken. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t have kids,&quot; Kei says. </p><p>&emsp;A nervous chuckle circles the room. Nav looks relieved that I tried to ligthen things: it feels like the first time I&apos;ve been really useful to this team in a month. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re probably going to ask me to make a list again, just like I did three years ago, some of you willl remember that. They&apos;re going to force me to rank you. And I&apos;m sure you all know generally where you stand.&quot; I feel him staring at me through the back of his head: he doesn&apos;t have to turn around. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;A team of six is already pretty damn small,&quot; Mike says, mumbling into his folded hands. &quot;We&apos;re probably the smallest in the company already.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Which might mean we&apos;re fine. But it&apos;s not just six of us anymore,&quot; Nav says. I can see the notification come across his computer: one of the executives is waiting to enter the meeting after it is over. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask, feeling my heart skip a beat. If it&apos;s HR, that means the reaper is taking someone away. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s seven now. We vetted him before we lost the contract,&quot; Navesh says. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Did he even interview?&quot; Kei asks. &quot;I don&apos;t think any of us were there to get to know them.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;The executive walks in: it&apos;s my boss&apos; boss, dressed to the nines, probably lost since someone like him would never even bother to step into a wing of the company like ours. Behind him is a dark-haired, clean-cut guy dressed like any of us used to: slacks, a belt, and a tucked-in collared shirt. Feels like we should stand at attention for such seniority, but I&apos;m already up. The new recruit isn&apos;t nervous at all in introducing himself. </p>",
      "<p>&emsp;&quot;Nice to meet you all. I&apos;m Reed Broderick,&quot; he says. The executive hands him two dozen donuts, and he puts them on the table. &quot;I&apos;ve heard this is how you make an impression.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;You heard right,&quot; Kei says. The animals all reach their hands for the box, but I lean further against the wall. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;So where are you from, Reed?&quot; Michael asks, his mouth full of donut. &quot;And how old are you? We&apos;ve got a lot of young ones on this team now.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Twenty-eight. I graduated last year with a Mechanical degree, but I haven&apos;t found much of anywhere to work until now,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;A year older than I am. </p><p>&emsp;The executive cuts in. &quot;I can assure you that he&apos;s the best. You know his father, John: he used to work in Aerospace until he moved up.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;So the legacy continues,&quot; Navesh says. &quot;I remember your father! We worked together before they made me the captain of this ship.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Reed exudes the rest of his confidence. &quot;I know I didn&apos;t formally interview, but I&apos;m really excited to be a part of this team. Let my work speak for me,&quot; he insists, walking around the table to join me in the back. </p><p>&emsp;Navesh squeezes words out under the executive&apos;s hopeful gaze: &quot;Well, we certainly have fresh energy with all these young people here.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Reed extends his hand, and I shake it. &quot;Nice to meet you, bro,&quot; Reed says, and despite the added tension, I find myself relieved to make another possible friend. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody Dunsmore,&quot; I say. I&apos;d compliment his firm handshake if it didn&apos;t make me feel like I was becoming my father. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;m Kei. Kei Sakurajima.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She extends her hand as the others rise to introduce themselves like it&apos;s the start of a church service. The executive lifts himself from leaning against the door frame. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then I guess I&apos;ll leave y&apos;all to it,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;As the others swarm our unexpected colleague, I try to remember my own first day here, but it was really like any other. It was five hours before IT could get my email working, and although Navesh was warm with his welcome, nobody stood from their cubes to do so much as introduce themselves. I had to bring my own &apos;new guy donuts&apos; the next day to get the rest of the bean-counters and nerds to acknowledge my presence! </p><p>&emsp;We leave the room as soon as everyone gets their introduction. Nav looks like he wants to say something to me again about my timeliness, but is intercepted by Scott, and as we walk back, Reed takes a particular interest in Kei and I. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Designated seating, I was told,&quot; Reed says. He looks at the new edict from HR, a paper map atop his Bankers box of stuff. &quot;Says I&apos;m right next to you, Kei. Hope you&apos;re patient enough for all my questions.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I curse the corporate gods of fate that put me in the empty row with Wilbur. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;That shouldn&apos;t be a problem,&quot; Kei replies. &quot;Cody&apos;s bothered me since day one, and he&apos;s still doing it.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;How long have you both been here?&quot; Reed asks. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Three years and some change,&quot; Kei says. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Are you also new?&quot; Reed asks me. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. I&apos;ve been here for two years,&quot;I tell him. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh.&quot; His eyes turn from my box on the map, which still reads SUPPORT ENGINEER, and I know I&apos;ve been asking the same question. </p><p>&emsp;I feel a finger tap my shoulder after the others pass us. &quot;Can I talk to you for a second?&quot; Nav says. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh, yeah, sure,&quot; I tell him. My stomach drops further, realizing I have no idea if there&apos;s a bottom. We walk a couple steps to the row with vacant cubes. </p><p>&emsp;I try to take the fire from him by calling myself out first, stumbling over the first words that come to me. &quot;I&apos;m sorry I barely made it on time. Moving shouldn&apos;t be an excuse, and&mdash;&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I get it,&quot; he says. &quot;But if you were any later, that would have been a reflection on me in front of my boss, and the kind of things that I allow here. I&apos;m not safe here either. But, look. I don&apos;t know if you&apos;re just burned-out or something: you&apos;ve been on the threshold of the next level for ages, and I get you&apos;re feeling restless, but . . .&quot; He pauses because the next words are uncomfortable. &quot;If I&apos;m forced to make a list, I want you to be ready.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I mean that you&apos;re going to be near the bottom,&quot; he says, and then clarifies, &quot;by rank.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Me and the newer . . . guy?&quot; I ask, hushing my voice so no one can overhear me. Asking about seniority is totally my right, but I&apos;m too damn nervous to bring it up. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;You are, roughly.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;The rising feeling makes me ball my fists behind my back. </p><p>&emsp;I guess I only matter if I fucking know someone, I think. </p><p>&emsp;I hold back the strain in my eyes, and I find myself thinking that if my dream wasn&apos;t to work in that new building a little higher in the valley, and if the fears of that mortgage weren&apos;t so punishing, I&apos;d be actively out looking for something else. </p><p>&emsp;Looking out the window at that building calms me down just enough to pedal a false face of humility. &quot;I understand. I haven&apos;t been that great,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, I like you, Cody,&quot; he reassures me, but I don&apos;t feel it. &quot;I don&apos;t pull the strings or drive the gears. I&apos;m just a pinion between the executives and my team.&quot; An idler gear, only transferring the force it&apos;s given by the others. </p><p>&emsp;It takes a couple breaths before I can bring myself to respond. &quot;I&apos;ll do better, then, whether it means something or not,&quot; I tell him. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, with all this idle time we&apos;re gonna have, we&apos;ll have a couple projects to improve stuff. Make stuff the customers don&apos;t know they want yet. For me, it was redesigning the battery enclosure that made me prove myself enough to move up. So maybe . . .&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s a chance, you&apos;re saying.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;But not a promise.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I know that shit already, Nav, I think to myself, as I feel the whole path to my future rearranging itself in front of me. It takes all the strength I have to refuse to show it in my expression. </p><p>&emsp;A breath. And then another. </p>&quot;I appreciate you telling me this,&quot; I manage, enough to get him to go away. As the first tear crests my eye, trying to suck it back into my tear duct, I take a deep breath and decide to take my break early."

        "<p id=\"1.11.1.1\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Late Sunday morning, around 11:00, I awoke with my neck twisted against the closet door, my face saturated with drool, shirt missing, and a sticky note taped to my forehead with Miguel&apos;s handwriting that read &quot;DRINK WATER.&quot; The pounding headache had mostly subsided: I must have slept it off, or drank loads of water the night before from how quickly I immediately had to sprint to the restroom. And after relieving myself, I found my phone on the counter with three unread texts:</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.2\" class=\"Cody\"><span class=msgfromdate>Miguel Ruelas // 06:37</span></p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.3\" class=\"Cody\"><span class=msgfrom>u gotta tell me whassup with that wack cosplay chick. neighbor? break-in? u invite rollplay hookers over when i was asleep?</span></p>",

        "<p id=\"1.11.1.5\" class=\"Cody\"><span class=msgfrom>or shit maybe I dreamt it, doesnt explain the bruise on my leg unless something happened that i forgot</span></p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.6\" class=\"Cody\"><span class=msgfromdate>Miguel Ruelas // 07:14</span></p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.7\" class=\"Cody\"><span class=msgfrom>anyways congrats bro on the house. lets catch up next week im off to church. cleaned up some of the mess. love u bro</span></p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.8\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I looked around to find that the madman actually cleaned everything. The pillows were arranged on the couch, the beer cans sorted into the recycling bin outside, and even the counters looked like he gave them a clean wipe. I responded: </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.9\" class=\"Cody\"><span class=msgtodate>Cody Dunsmore // 11:12</span></p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.10\" class=\"Cody\"><span class=msgto>Thanks for cleaning up dude, you didn&apos;t have to do that! Let&apos;s chill next weekend. Not much else to do when everyone moved away :/</span></p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.11\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Feeling disgusting, I rushed upstairs to take a shower, getting off the sweat and stench of a failed all-nigher. My shower thoughts brought me back to that dream in another world: getting slashed by a crazy roleplayer and encountering strangers in some semi-modern renaissance world. I looked down at my left hand, as if the warm shower water wasn&apos;t enough to tell me whether or not the flesh parted like a bad haircut. But all I found was smooth skin. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;It must have been a shared dream, like Inception, because I still don&apos;t recall inviting anyone over: hell, I don&apos;t even know who to call. But as the scalding water relieves the pounding in my head, I find that all I can think of is the magical woman I fought in my dreams, how she straddled me, threw knives at me, and cleaved that heavy greatsword straight into the middle of my lacrosse stick. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I dried myself off before a different kind of pleasure could emerge from those thoughts: I was more absorbed by the strangeness of that vivid and continuous dream. My curiosity led me to try opening the door to the closet, finding another door behind it that looked as if its handle were blasted with a blowtorch. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I just assumed I&apos;d forgotten there was no closet. Were these pre-builds originally intended for a hotel chain or something with the neighbor door? It didn&apos;t make sense at all, but I knew I wouldn&apos;t feel safe, and I was actively looking for any kind of excuse to make something stupid in my robotics workshop. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;After a drive-thru breakfast, I went to the home improvement store to get one of those school-shooter-stopping door stops: one level shy of something permanent like bolting the damn door in place. With a spare microcontroller, I hooked up a hall-effect sensor and a buzzer &mdash; a magnet sensor and a loud speaker, basically &mdash; to detect if that door was ever to move. By soldering the wires to the breadboard, along with some AA batteries, and using generous dollops of hot glue to stick it to the inside wall of the strange-looking door, I called it a day around 9:30 PM, returning to my bed for an early night of sleep so I could get up tomorrow, only to spend four hours doom-scrolling through the week&apos;s sordid politics. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I consider all these details right now when I&apos;m driving ten over the speed limit. It&apos;s not wondering if the notched cut in my lacrosse stick was from when Miguel and I were drunkenly tossing a tennis ball outside, nor is it my missing iPod Classic. It&apos;s how I could have possibly screwed myself over this bad. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I set three alarms. Either my dumb ass shut them off in succession, I slept through them, or I did bad math in figuring out the absolute latest I could wake up, forgetting that I had to take a shower. Now I&apos;m screaming down the highway, hating myself as I KNOW that I&apos;m going to either make it right on time or a couple minutes too late. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.1.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I skipped breakfast when that ulcerous, cantankerous feeling arrested my stomach, running the numbers over and over and over about how long it would take me to get there.

        "<p id=\"1.11.2.6\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The executive cuts in. &quot;I can assure you that he&apos;s the best. You know his father, John: he used to work in Aerospace until he moved up.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.7\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;So the legacy continues,&quot; Navesh says. &quot;I remember your father! We worked together before they made me the captain of this ship.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.8\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Reed exudes the rest of his confidence. &quot;I know I didn&apos;t formally interview, but I&apos;m really excited to be a part of this team. Let my work speak for me,&quot; he insists, walking around the table to join me in the back. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.9\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Navesh squeezes words out under the executive&apos;s hopeful gaze: &quot;Well, we certainly have fresh energy with all these young people here.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.10\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Reed extends his hand, and I shake it. &quot;Nice to meet you, bro,&quot; Reed says, and despite the added tension, I find myself relieved to make another possible friend. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.11\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Cody Dunsmore,&quot; I say. I&apos;d compliment his firm handshake if it didn&apos;t make me feel like I was becoming my father. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;m Kei. Kei Sakurajima.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She extends her hand as the others rise to introduce themselves like it&apos;s the start of a church service. The executive lifts himself from leaning against the door frame. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Then I guess I&apos;ll leave y&apos;all to it,&quot; he says. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;As the others swarm our unexpected colleague, I try to remember my own first day here, but it was really like any other. It was five hours before IT could get my email working, and although Navesh was warm with his welcome, nobody stood from their cubes to do so much as introduce themselves. I had to bring my own &apos;new guy donuts&apos; the next day to get the rest of the bean-counters and nerds to acknowledge my presence! </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;We leave the room as soon as everyone gets their introduction. Nav looks like he wants to say something to me again about my timeliness, but is intercepted by Scott, and as we walk back, Reed takes a particular interest in Kei and I. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Designated seating, I was told,&quot; Reed says. He looks at the new edict from HR, a paper map atop his Bankers box of stuff. &quot;Says I&apos;m right next to you, Kei. Hope you&apos;re patient enough for all my questions.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I curse the corporate gods of fate that put me in the empty row with Wilbur. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;That shouldn&apos;t be a problem,&quot; Kei replies. &quot;Cody&apos;s bothered me since day one, and he&apos;s still doing it.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;How long have you both been here?&quot; Reed asks. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Three years and some change,&quot; Kei says. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Are you also new?&quot; Reed asks me. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.23\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No. I&apos;ve been here for two years,&quot;I tell him. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh.&quot; His eyes turn from my box on the map, which still reads SUPPORT ENGINEER, and I know I&apos;ve been asking the same question. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I feel a finger tap my shoulder after the others pass us. &quot;Can I talk to you for a second?&quot; Nav says. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Uh, yeah, sure,&quot; I tell him. My stomach drops further, realizing I have no idea if there&apos;s a bottom. We walk a couple steps to the row with vacant cubes. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I try to take the fire from him by calling myself out first, stumbling over the first words that come to me. &quot;I&apos;m sorry I barely made it on time. Moving shouldn&apos;t be an excuse, and&mdash;&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I get it,&quot; he says. &quot;But if you were any later, that would have been a reflection on me in front of my boss, and the kind of things that I allow here. I&apos;m not safe here either. But, look. I don&apos;t know if you&apos;re just burned-out or something: you&apos;ve been on the threshold of the next level for ages, and I get you&apos;re feeling restless, but . . .&quot; He pauses because the next words are uncomfortable. &quot;If I&apos;m forced to make a list, I want you to be ready.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I mean that you&apos;re going to be near the bottom,&quot; he says, and then clarifies, &quot;by rank.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Me and the newer . . . guy?&quot; I ask, hushing my voice so no one can overhear me. Asking about seniority is totally my right, but I&apos;m too damn nervous to bring it up. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You are, roughly.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The rising feeling makes me ball my fists behind my back. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.34\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I guess I only matter if I fucking know someone, I think. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.35\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I hold back the strain in my eyes, and I find myself thinking that if my dream wasn&apos;t to work in that new building a little higher in the valley, and if the fears of that mortgage weren&apos;t so punishing, I&apos;d be actively out looking for something else. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.36\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Looking out the window at that building calms me down just enough to pedal a false face of humility. &quot;I understand. I haven&apos;t been that great,&quot; I say. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.37\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No, I like you, Cody,&quot; he reassures me, but I don&apos;t feel it. &quot;I don&apos;t pull the strings or drive the gears. I&apos;m just a pinion between the executives and my team.&quot; An idler gear, only transferring the force it&apos;s given by the others. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.38\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;It takes a couple breaths before I can bring myself to respond. &quot;I&apos;ll do better, then, whether it means something or not,&quot; I tell him. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.39\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Well, with all this idle time we&apos;re gonna have, we&apos;ll have a couple projects to improve stuff. Make stuff the customers don&apos;t know they want yet. For me, it was redesigning the battery enclosure that made me prove myself enough to move up. So maybe . . .&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.40\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s a chance, you&apos;re saying.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.41\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But not a promise.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.42\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I know that shit already, Nav, I think to myself, as I feel the whole path to my future rearranging itself in front of me. It takes all the strength I have to refuse to show it in my expression. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.11.2.43\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;A breath. And then another. </p>"

      "<p>&emsp;There&apos;s no early breaks in all the domestic quests. It only took a couple days before I realized that sitting on the job was a bad image, unless you have a lunch pail in your hands. Just like any routine &mdash; whether it&apos;s a new cycle of combat training, classes, or a new job &mdash; the first three days are memorable because it&apos;s all so fresh. I thought taking different quests would make each day distinct from the last, but from the fourth day onward, it all became a blur of motion, forgotten at the end of each day by an exaspirated body and a tired mind.</p><p>&emsp;This is the first job on city watch that has me raking leaves on the side. Though the mountainside is still flushed with fading green, the eager leaves transform from yellow to red and deposit themselves early on the stone thoroughfares. From a raised vantage point at the southwestern hillside of Gaffesend, I abate the stress by drawing in the crisp mountain air, watching as the browning wild lashes of the southern grasslands are battered about by gale winds.</p><p>&emsp;Long in the distance, the grand lake reflects the shadowed mountain view, too far to make the crests of little waves. I watch as junior guards paddle back from their postings on the outer rim, wondering which of my friends are among them. But it&apos;s nice to know that at least I&apos;m not alone.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Have you ever attached a broom handle to the end of it?&quot; I ask. Her sharp eyes bounce between the rake and the tip of her tail.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I-I don&apos;t think that would work, it&apos;s not strong enough,&quot; Caeda says. I&apos;ve gotten to know her a lot better: the shy pair well with the timid since they end up taking similar tasks. &quot;When should we head down?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well there&apos;s certainly no shortage of leaves, the Verdalan Gods make sure of it. Maybe now, I guess,&quot; I tell her. &quot;This was all supposed to be done before the royals came to town, as if miles of road could be effectively polished by five junior guards.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What does such a task even have to do with protecting?&quot; Caeda mutters.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re protecting . . . the . . . image, I guess, of the city. And next we&apos;ll be protecting the parade route.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sometimes it feels like they&apos;re just trying to keep us busy with silly tasks,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s allowed me to get to know the locals really well, at least. They say they&apos;re glad we take the tasks that make a difference.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s because you fawn for social interaction, it&apos;s quite marvelous to me how you&apos;re so full of energy all the time. But that&apos;s coming from someone who doesn&apos;t make friends unless they see them every day for about a month.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A month?&quot; The math surprises me. But it sounds about right when I count all the days I&apos;ve taken off. I walk with Oriya, Jullian, Berry, and Ryder every morning for five of them, to take new postings from the quest board and get to work. Every sixth or so, I persuade them to join me on a hike or go swimming in the hot springs. And every night is my chance to get out and socialize when I&apos;m not taking night quests: having only scouted twice, I feel quite distant from the others.</p><p>&emsp;The loneliness carries into other areas, too. I&apos;ve only seen Jullian five times since the start of this transition. Besides walking to work hand-in-hand, we&apos;ve gotten together almost every day off to blow off some steam. I&apos;ve only been able to convince him once to go on a date with me to the hot springs, and it was on my earnings. The other times he says he&apos;s too busy &mdash; though I always see him with his friends. It disappoints me when our acts of passion end as soon as he gets off: the only courtesy he seems to have is letting me get there first.</p><p>&emsp;We descend the hill as the northern scouts congregate in Gaffesend Square. The bell tolls midday: normally that would mean a break for rations, but our service is expected to run later, and nobody minds when it makes this a &quot;two-quest-day.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I bet Bertram rues being sick when quest forms are this easy,&quot; I tell Cae. The slowness of this life almost makes me believe that Gaffe is as insular as the capital, capable of holding small events for royalty passing through the town. We&apos;re ordered to line up on the sides of the Main Street. It feels like a festival, the way all the street lamps are adorned with fresh flowers; the businesses shuttered for an hour; and the full population split between halves of the street. We stand in pattern between the onlookers and the empty road. The senior guards are busy on the city outskirts, demanding papers, and ensuring no Chymaeran spies are guising unwitting villagers. We hold the ceremonial rifles that we retrieved from the armory, clasped between our hands and upright, though Aldrin insists we &quot;can&apos;t be fully trusted with them yet,&quot; and that we need to &quot;train with a blade before we can handle them.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My eyes steady on the vacancy in front of me on the other side of the road, originally intended to be held by Bertram. Before long, the shimmering white carriage prattles down the road, drawn by two black horses. They&apos;re looking to have a two-nights&apos;-stay in the hot springs, and we&apos;re meant to prove to them that Gaffesend is safe, encouraging more tourists to make the trek to enrich our lands.</p><p>&emsp;I figure most of our population is excited for the presence of a Chosen Mask: we got the news that he was being paid to defend the carriage between villages. It&apos;s rare that anyone notable ever passes through, especially since we&apos;re the last stop before nothing. I can see him waving to his admirers from the coachman&apos;s seat as they cheer and throw flowers at the feet of the horses. Within the carriage, a finely-dressed family of six waves from the windows, wearing white and gold.</p><p>&emsp;I feel my hands loosen their tension on the rifle. The nagging feeling of fear that&apos;s plagued me since forever is almost in the back seat, and around me, I can drink to the exuberance of the town. To my left, Cae smiles, predictably not the type to cheer. To my right, Pax pumps his fist in the air. And Bertram is absolutely focused on the royals, standing there directly in front of me.</p><p>&emsp;The carriage is drawing closer, at least a hundred paces away. Some of the family&apos;s younger passengers have exited the carriage, walking alongside the road and tossing wrapped candies to the onlookers. The nagging feeling grows stronger. It&apos;s just too peaceful. And as my hands tension around the black steel, Bertram&apos;s eyes catch a glint of amethyst when he decides to make his move.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;They&apos;re close enough to run me over, but my body&apos;s trained to react before I can think. Muscle memory comes before thought, thought before fear, and fear before true reaction, so it&apos;s only when I&apos;m halfway across the road that the thoughts finally reach my muscles. The others are only beginning to notice when the Chymaeran fleshwalker raises the rifle. I&apos;m the only one that happened to know enough and be close enough to respond, and when I try to take another step, I feel the gravity of my past flood my veins with molasses.</p><p>&emsp;I struggle to refuse the defenses of my own mind. I always swear I can taste the smoke from that fire when my heartbeat rises. And as the Chymaeran assassin guising my friend prepares to take aim and pull the trigger, all I can do is watch as I collapse to the street, giving the horses such a start that they shy and snort, rearing on their hind legs, casting the carriage forwards and backwards.</p><p>&emsp;Pax is quick on the uptake: for every dearth of common sense, he excels in his perception, tuned to that energy of the attacker. While the other junior guards only begin to notice, and the Chosen is left helpless in a battle of speed, the assassin pulls the trigger, spooking the horses and the spectators as Pax tackles him to the ground.</p><p>&emsp;I brace my head with my cheek brushing moss between the roadway stones. The coachman pulls the slip knot, and the horses&apos; hooves clatter against the road, and I hold my breath, as if it could change the chances of the startled stallions shattering my spine or ribs. But they clamber right overhead, and as the carriage passes directly over my prostrated body lying straight with the road, I feel the wetness of something dense drip across my cheek.</p><p>&emsp;My ears still ring from the blast, but I can hear the cries of the children and the wife. And when I&apos;m sure my whole body can still respond to its commands, I begin to crawl from beneath the carriage.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;May the gods damn your pathetic town and its useless guards,&quot; the wife says. &quot;It should be wiped off the face of the map!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I begin to imagine the repercussions, and I try to prepare myself for what&apos;s to come. I accept my fate to vanish from this program. I had my chance, and yet I couldn&apos;t even finish the job!</p><p>&emsp;The Chosen drags me out from beneath the carriage with his gloved hands. A long streak of the husband&apos;s blood stains my bangs and trickles down my nose. When I look to the inside of the white carriage, emptied of its crying inhabitants and bright with a splatter of red, I find the husband taking shallow breaths as he holds his shoulder, tended to by the glowing hands of their family&apos;s hired healer.</p><p>&emsp;The immaculately-dressed wife&apos;s jewelry clatters when she gets her hands around my collar, thrashing me as the Chosen hesitates to disarm his source of wealth. Her hands are already red with her lover&apos;s blood, clothes absent the pristine ivory white they surely struggled to sustain on such sultry trails.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You cowering, yellow-bellied bitch,&quot; she exclaims. Her gloved hand batters my cheek with deafening leather contact. &quot;You leach our tribute. You live to give your lives for us, and I&apos;ll be sure you don&apos;t see another sunrise in this line of work. The guard of this backwater town are a joke!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I can feel my tears streaming, directly in the view of all my comrades that can only just stand there and watch. Jullian ducks his head when I meet his eyes. Cae freezes, her tail frayed. And Ryder and Pax are busy wrestling the Chymaeran as it tries to change forms. </p><p>&emsp;But I hear the husband. &quot;Dear. That young guard is the reason my head is on my shoulders. I mean, Gods, if she hadn&apos;t given the horses a start...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;She nearly got you killed!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The bullet did that,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But still,&quot; she says. The mercurial woman releases my collar and tensions her fists, letting out an exasperated cry. The side of my face aches as I slouch, wiping my tears with the unsullied parts of my arms, remembering not to dirty their carriage with contact from my body.</p><p>&emsp;But it&apos;s the distress of the children that damages me the most. Standing on the other side of their life-altering trauma, facing such failure that I&apos;m painted with the aggressor, the devastating shock registers on their faces, now devoid of sorrow, just speechless like I once was as they try to recalibrate their understanding of how horrifying the world can be. And all I want is to embrace them, to tell them that everything will be alright, to let them cry into my shoulder.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You failed us. And you&apos;re going to pay for this,&quot; the wife screams at Aldrin when he approaches. &quot;How are you going to make this right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ll make it right by apologizing to my officer,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t care how much money you have, what role you play in the Empire, you will apologize for assaulting the woman who tried to save you!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And failed,&quot; she insists. &quot;You&apos;re messing with Valensend blood&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You gave two days of warning for your arrival, refusing like all you rich types do to pay in advance, and then you have the gall to say we didn&apos;t prepare. It takes weeks!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The woman tensions her fists. Two of children grasp her dress by the fabric. I draw deep breaths to make the blood flow back into my fingers and legs, all the while feeling like I&apos;m stealing a resource I no longer deserve.</p><p>&emsp;But I hear the father&apos;s voice behind me. &quot;She would have complained the same if it was just a scare: I would have stopped her if I had the strength. As far as I&apos;m concerned, you saved my life.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But I hesitated. I saved no one. It was luck.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Luck or not, you&apos;re a reason my children still have a father,&quot; he says. I turn around. He gestures for the servant and the healer to tend to my scratches, and with a quick wave of a hand, I feel the sting slowly dissipate from my face.</p><p>&emsp;He reaches from the open door, dabbing his blood from my skin with a clean corner of a towel, ensuring that nothing ill will come of this. Behind us, the two continue to argue as senior guards apprehend the battered Chymaeran assassin. It&apos;s only when I see the assailant&apos;s guise of my cherished friend that I remember the absence of the real one.</p><p>&emsp;I release an unintelligible string of words before the panic peaks inside me once again. Aldrin shouts. Two of my friends try to stop me, and the woman screams of my cowardice, but all I can think of is what I learned it takes for a Chymaeran to steal a guise.</p><p>&emsp;I run as fast as my feet will take me, choosing to try and save another, even if it means damnation for leaving this all behind.</p>"

I&apos;ve only been able to convince him once to go on a date with me to the hot springs, and it was on my earnings. The other times he says he&apos;s too busy &mdash; though I always see him with his friends. It disappoints me when our acts of passion end as soon as he gets off: the only courtesy he seems to have is letting me get there first.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.1.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We descend the hill as the northern scouts congregate in Gaffesend Square. The bell tolls midday: normally that would mean a break for rations, but our service is expected to run later, and nobody minds when it makes this a &quot;two-quest-day.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.1.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I bet Bertram rues being sick when quest forms are this easy,&quot; I tell Cae. The slowness of this life almost makes me believe that Gaffe is as insular as the capital, capable of holding small events for royalty passing through the town. We&apos;re ordered to line up on the sides of the Main Street. It feels like a festival, the way all the street lamps are adorned with fresh flowers; the businesses shuttered for an hour; and the full population split between halves of the street. We stand in pattern between the onlookers and the empty road. The senior guards are busy on the city outskirts, demanding papers, and ensuring no Chymaeran spies are guising unwitting villagers. We hold the ceremonial rifles that we retrieved from the armory, clasped between our hands and upright, though Aldrin insists we &quot;can&apos;t be fully trusted with them yet,&quot; and that we need to &quot;train with a blade before we can handle them.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.1.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My eyes steady on the vacancy in front of me on the other side of the road, originally intended to be held by Bertram. Before long, the shimmering white carriage prattles down the road, drawn by two black horses. They&apos;re looking to have a two-nights&apos;-stay in the hot springs, and we&apos;re meant to prove to them that Gaffesend is safe, encouraging more tourists to make the trek to enrich our lands.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.1.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I figure most of our population is excited for the presence of a Chosen Mask: we got the news that he was being paid to defend the carriage between villages. It&apos;s rare that anyone notable ever passes through, especially since we&apos;re the last stop before nothing. I can see him waving to his admirers from the coachman&apos;s seat as they cheer and throw flowers at the feet of the horses. Within the carriage, a finely-dressed family of six waves from the windows, wearing white and gold.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.1.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I feel my hands loosen their tension on the rifle. The nagging feeling of fear that&apos;s plagued me since forever is almost in the back seat, and around me, I can drink to the exuberance of the town. To my left, Cae smiles, predictably not the type to cheer. To my right, Pax pumps his fist in the air. And Bertram is absolutely focused on the royals, standing there directly in front of me.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.1.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The carriage is drawing closer, at least a hundred paces away. Some of the family&apos;s younger passengers have exited the carriage, walking alongside the road and tossing wrapped candies to the onlookers. The nagging feeling grows stronger. It&apos;s just too peaceful. And as my hands tension around the black steel, Bertram&apos;s eyes catch a glint of amethyst when he decides to make his move.</p>"
      ],
      [
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.1\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;They&apos;re close enough to run me over, but my body&apos;s trained to react before I can think. Muscle memory comes before thought, thought before fear, and fear before true reaction, so it&apos;s only when I&apos;m halfway across the road that the thoughts finally reach my muscles. The others are only beginning to notice when the Chymaeran fleshwalker raises the rifle. I&apos;m the only one that happened to know enough and be close enough to respond, and when I try to take another step, I feel the gravity of my past flood my veins with molasses.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.2\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I struggle to refuse the defenses of my own mind. I always swear I can taste the smoke from that fire when my heartbeat rises. And as the Chymaeran assassin guising my friend prepares to take aim and pull the trigger, all I can do is watch as I collapse to the street, giving the horses such a start that they shy and snort, rearing on their hind legs, casting the carriage forwards and backwards.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.3\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Pax is quick on the uptake: for every dearth of common sense, he excels in his perception, tuned to that energy of the attacker. While the other junior guards only begin to notice, and the Chosen is left helpless in a battle of speed, the assassin pulls the trigger, spooking the horses and the spectators as Pax tackles him to the ground.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.4\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I brace my head with my cheek brushing moss between the roadway stones. The coachman pulls the slip knot, and the horses&apos; hooves clatter against the road, and I hold my breath, as if it could change the chances of the startled stallions shattering my spine or ribs. But they clamber right overhead, and as the carriage passes directly over my prostrated body lying straight with the road, I feel the wetness of something dense drip across my cheek.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.5\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My ears still ring from the blast, but I can hear the cries of the children and the wife. And when I&apos;m sure my whole body can still respond to its commands, I begin to crawl from beneath the carriage.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.6\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;May the gods damn your pathetic town and its useless guards,&quot; the wife says. &quot;It should be wiped off the face of the map!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.7\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I begin to imagine the repercussions, and I try to prepare myself for what&apos;s to come. I accept my fate to vanish from this program. I had my chance, and yet I couldn&apos;t even finish the job!</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.8\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The Chosen drags me out from beneath the carriage with his gloved hands. A long streak of the husband&apos;s blood stains my bangs and trickles down my nose. When I look to the inside of the white carriage, emptied of its crying inhabitants and bright with a splatter of red, I find the husband taking shallow breaths as he holds his shoulder, tended to by the glowing hands of their family&apos;s hired healer.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.9\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The immaculately-dressed wife&apos;s jewelry clatters when she gets her hands around my collar, thrashing me as the Chosen hesitates to disarm his source of wealth. Her hands are already red with her lover&apos;s blood, clothes absent the pristine ivory white they surely struggled to sustain on such sultry trails.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.10\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You cowering, yellow-bellied bitch,&quot; she exclaims. Her gloved hand batters my cheek with deafening leather contact. &quot;You leach our tribute. You live to give your lives for us, and I&apos;ll be sure you don&apos;t see another sunrise in this line of work. The guard of this backwater town are a joke!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.11\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I can feel my tears streaming, directly in the view of all my comrades that can only just stand there and watch. Jullian ducks his head when I meet his eyes. Cae freezes, her tail frayed. And Ryder and Pax are busy wrestling the Chymaeran as it tries to change forms. </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.12\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But I hear the husband. &quot;Dear. That young guard is the reason my head is on my shoulders. I mean, Gods, if she hadn&apos;t given the horses a start...&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.13\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;She nearly got you killed!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;The bullet did that,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But still,&quot; she says. The mercurial woman releases my collar and tensions her fists, letting out an exasperated cry. The side of my face aches as I slouch, wiping my tears with the unsullied parts of my arms, remembering not to dirty their carriage with contact from my body.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But it&apos;s the distress of the children that damages me the most. Standing on the other side of their life-altering trauma, facing such failure that I&apos;m painted with the aggressor, the devastating shock registers on their faces, now devoid of sorrow, just speechless like I once was as they try to recalibrate their understanding of how horrifying the world can be. And all I want is to embrace them, to tell them that everything will be alright, to let them cry into my shoulder.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You failed us. And you&apos;re going to pay for this,&quot; the wife screams at Aldrin when he approaches. &quot;How are you going to make this right?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ll make it right by apologizing to my officer,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t care how much money you have, what role you play in the Empire, you will apologize for assaulting the woman who tried to save you!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And failed,&quot; she insists. &quot;You&apos;re messing with Valensend blood&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You gave two days of warning for your arrival, refusing like all you rich types do to pay in advance, and then you have the gall to say we didn&apos;t prepare. It takes weeks!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.21\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The woman tensions her fists. Two of children grasp her dress by the fabric. I draw deep breaths to make the blood flow back into my fingers and legs, all the while feeling like I&apos;m stealing a resource I no longer deserve.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.22\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But I hear the father&apos;s voice behind me. &quot;She would have complained the same if it was just a scare: I would have stopped her if I had the strength. As far as I&apos;m concerned, you saved my life.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.23\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But I hesitated. I saved no one. It was luck.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Luck or not, you&apos;re a reason my children still have a father,&quot; he says. I turn around. He gestures for the servant and the healer to tend to my scratches, and with a quick wave of a hand, I feel the sting slowly dissipate from my face.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He reaches from the open door, dabbing his blood from my skin with a clean corner of a towel, ensuring that nothing ill will come of this. Behind us, the two continue to argue as senior guards apprehend the battered Chymaeran assassin. It&apos;s only when I see the assailant&apos;s guise of my cherished friend that I remember the absence of the real one.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I release an unintelligible string of words before the panic peaks inside me once again. Aldrin shouts. Two of my friends try to stop me, and the woman screams of my cowardice, but all I can think of is what I learned it takes for a Chymaeran to steal a guise.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.12.2.27\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I run as fast as my feet will take me, choosing to try and save another, even if it means damnation for leaving this all behind.</p>"

      "<p>&emsp;I can only work as fast as the computer will take me. I&apos;ve spent so many hours between renders imagining how I would boost the performance if IT gave me a blank check and I was then the bottleneck &mdash; although a workstation laptop is nice to take home, it has nothing over one of those stationary rigs that the Robinson-Monroe lifers were grandfathered into.</p><p>&emsp;They gave me the laptop two years ago, and it hasn&apos;t been updated since. One day I booted into BIOS to see if I could overclock it, or take it to its limits. But IT&apos;s Great Wall of Control knows no bounds, so all I can do is sit here for twenty minutes at a time before I notice the changes in the drawing are applied.</p><p>&emsp;Those twenty minutes are silent. Only Wilbur and I sit in the row, and we&apos;re not even across from each other. Reed filled in the spot that the last escapee left behind, and although I was eager for months to move next to Kei and take the next steps, Navesh insisted it was a &quot;major waste of time.&quot; I feel like Wilbur and I have exhausted every topic across the generational gap: his kids, when I plan to marry, if I have a serious girlfriend yet, cars, and sports. Every day I hear his wake apnea over the partitions, and sometimes I wonder if it&apos;s the perfect cover for him to be sleeping.</p><p>&emsp;The computer still holds an hourglass. It&apos;s midday, and the neighboring row is filled with chatter. I hear Reed&apos;s voice the most often, and a little too often: if golden retrievers could design and code, and the connotation didn&apos;t imply he was stupid, I think it would fit him well. Kei acknowledges his musings here and there, but is always so focused that she spits no more than a couple words.</p><p>&emsp;I check the calendar in the lower right corner of my screen. Fall is fast approaching, and when I count, it&apos;s been almost four weeks since I moved in. Four weekends of my parents coming over to visit, bringing over one of my favorite home-cooked meals, allowing them to ask when they&apos;ll have grandkids now that I have a house. Four weeks since I lost my brother&apos;s classic IPod, so now I listen to music on my phone. But also four weeks without drinking: most days I just go home, spend an hour on the computer scrolling my list of games, trying to convince myself to play something, and then go to sleep early unless I go to the gym with Miguel.</p><p>&emsp;Reed keeps rambling on about sports and hobbies, and the more I just sit there &mdash; helpless to walk over or else I&apos;ll look lonely and desperate &mdash; the more I wonder if I&apos;m getting the right dose of meds. The longer time drags, and the later into my twenties it gets, the further I feel from the spurious passion of those college years where it was forced out of me. It&apos;s like being at the bottom of a dark pool, or a distant game of telephone recalling how I last recalled those moments. My vocal cords feel neglected for how little use they get, and like an unmotivated violinist, I&apos;ve been unpracticed for a while.</p><p>&emsp;The render loads. It breaks the entire assembly, and I have another three keystrokes before I wait even longer.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey, Reed. Good job on the redline today,&quot; Nav says. &quot;I hope you&apos;ve been getting used to the software?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; he says. &quot;Kei has been teaching me well. And Cody over there, too.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I count the green-stamped pages on my desk. Three I&apos;ve completed today. Maybe they just forget I work here?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So anyways. I want the three junior engineers to follow me,&quot; Nav says. I duck my head to look busy when he comes over. &quot;Cody, can you follow us?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure, Nav,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;We gather in one of the small meeting rooms. I sit first near the door, then Kei and Reed sit together on the far side. Nav makes small talk when he&apos;s plugging in his laptop. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen you at any of the happy hours, Cody,&quot; he says. &quot;The whole team was there last week: what have you been so busy with?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I even got Kei to go once,&quot; Reed says. &quot;And she&apos;s usually busy all the time!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Kei smiles. &quot;Yeah, I guess I can admit last week was a little fun. Even if it&apos;s just talking about guy stuff at a sports bar.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Reed looks at me earnestly. I can tell that he means it. &quot;You should come.&quot; He reminds me of my business major roommates in college, except before I had a legitimate excuse.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Sounds like fun.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, tonight&apos;s the night. We were thinking Chili&apos;s,&quot; Nav says. &quot;And you all have been doing great, so I thought I&apos;d buy you all a drink.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cheers to that!&quot; Reed exclaims, raising an imaginary glass as I take a long draw of an energy drink. Nav flicks on the projector. His screen comes into focus, with a presentation labeled INTERMITTENT APPRENTICE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, BY NAVESH D. PRATEL.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So I&apos;ve been looking for ways to keep us busy. Things have been rather slow, and with Scott leaving and all &mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Scott&apos;s leaving?&quot; We say in near unison.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Oh, shoot &mdash; I was supposed to wait until Monday, gosh darn it,&quot; he says. &quot;Keep this between us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s going to happen?&quot; Kei asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know, with the hiring freeze and all, maybe something will come from within,&quot; Nav says. He winks so hard I think I hear it. &quot;Anyways, on an unrelated note, I have a project to keep you guys busy, instead of vanishing early to go to Starbucks.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Awesome,&quot; Reed says, but literally.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We spend forever just designing and redesigning what already exists. It&apos;s what most of engineering is if you&apos;re not R and D, after all.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Next slide.</p><p>&emsp;A 90&apos;s clip-art image of batteries is on the screen, each with little faces, shaking hands like little powered businessmen. I nearly laugh and I have to cover my mouth.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You spend so much time doing redlines as support engineers that you don&apos;t get to feel what it&apos;s like to come up with something. Surely you felt it in college. Maybe you&apos;ve missed it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I nod almost as excitedly as Reed does.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Enclosures, and more enclosures. Modifying dimensions of existing batteries by the smallest hair to please a customer&apos;s plans. Well, I want you all to take a shot at designing something entirely new,&quot; Nav says. &quot;You should know how batteries work from experience, not just designing the stuff they&apos;re housed in.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, a million times yes,&quot; Reed says, and even Kei looks slightly invested.</p><p>&emsp;The next slide is a cross-section of a battery scanned from one of the lifers&apos; textbooks, with such hand-drawn beauty there&apos;s no doubt it came from the seventies. I relish that it&apos;s finally something I&apos;m good at, involving all the robotics I love to do in my garage.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What happens is a redox reaction, or reduction-oxidation,&quot; Nav says, sounding like my Circuits professor if he was twenty years older. &quot;The anode has electron-rich elements like zinc, so it&apos;s negative. The cathode has elements like silver, so it&apos;s positive, and when you connect a wire from one to the other, you get electron flow.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Next slide.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We typically do nickel-cadmium or lithium-ion, far better than the lead-acid ones. Then there&apos;s nickel-metal-hydride . . .&quot; </p><p>&emsp;He drones on and on. With the energy drink death-gripped in my hand, I manage to stay awake: Reed can do it without anything. I decide to just wait for the email with the PowerPoint.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And, with all these considerations, your task will be to design an optimal battery, given a set volume. You&apos;ll do some theory, then we&apos;ll use the multimillion-dollar battery lab the R&D guys seem to have forgotten about.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s great,&quot; Reed says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How far you go with this project is up to you, and what you take from it is very important. You&apos;ll be doing this between redlines, getting feedback from Senior engineers, so that you design the best battery possible, and safely,&quot; he says, closing his laptop. &quot;We&apos;ll be starting next week. And since it&apos;s Friday, maybe we can talk about it at Happy Hour.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We all stand from the table. My foot falls asleep pretzeled on my other leg, so I stumble towards the door last. But before I can exit, Reed stops me.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;&quot;Hey bro. I was thinking we could talk about the project later,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;What is this, an undergrad lab? Is there a grade?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, that&apos;d be cool,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s your phone number? I already got Kei&apos;s last week. I was thinking we could make a group chat,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh, yeah, man, sure.&quot; I take his phone. I enter CODY WORK in the top, and the ten digits in the box. He shoots me a text of the first three emojis in his &quot;recent&quot; bar, and then proceeds to make the group message right then and there.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cool!&quot; He says. &quot;I was thinking, you look like you lift. Would you be down to lift before Monday?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I hardly even get in the door on time, dude, I want to tell him, but I&apos;m short on friends and his energy is nostalgic for friends in a time long past. &quot;Sure, I would like that,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Great! I&apos;ll send you the one I go to. You can use my membership,&quot; he insists.</p><p>&emsp;I nod my head, still in my cooldown period for using &quot;cool,&quot; &quot;great,&quot; or &quot;dope.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The rest of the day passes slowly. I draw a couple concepts for the enclosure on sheets of TOPS engineering paper, an empty pad from never designing anything new. The late hour comes, and when the others begin to make their egress, it&apos;s just Kei and I.</p><p>&emsp;After shutting down. I pass her while she&apos;s deep in a design project. I&apos;m surprised she notices.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Quite the eager guy, isn&apos;t he,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Who, Reed?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot; She laughs. &quot;Reminds me of you when you started here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, you mean before my soul got sucked from my body?&quot; I approach her, pulling down my eyelids and rolling my eyes to expose the bloodshot whites. &quot;Can you see it in there? Is it still alive?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She draws close to take a glance, and I catch a smell of familiar perfume from a date long forgotten. &quot;Just enough, I think.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I say, &quot;I don&apos;t have energy like he does. That&apos;s for sure. And . . . it&apos;s lonely over there. Wilbur just snores all day, unless he&apos;s bashing his keyboard and cursing at the new software.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, then maybe I could make up for it,&quot; she says. But she&apos;s still focused on her drawing.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I mean we could hang out sometime. Like, outside of work,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;My mind struggles to think of something platonic. &quot;Oh. Like what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know. The kind of stuff we used to do. But before, before...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Before that last summer before you left, I think. That was just Student Government stuff late in the evenings. Late work like this. I remember the last day of my junior year and her senior year, cleaning the room one last time as the Presidential cabinet, when I felt my heart swell in my chest with the apprehension of whether I was going to make my move. Time was running out. I had waited all year. The door was closed, and when she turned around, I pressed my lips to hers, and she dissolved into me, starting that perfect summer before she went&mdash;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody? I said we could do dinner.&quot; I was staring at her lips the whole time. It&apos;s a miracle I didn&apos;t raise half a chub, thanks to the waistband trick.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, that sounds great. I&apos;ve got a couple Chuck E Cheese coupons I&apos;ve been clipping out of the gazette.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What the fuck?&quot; She laughs, something I haven&apos;t heard in a while. &quot;See, this is the part of you I miss. There&apos;s surely still a soul in there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I hope so,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll shoot you a text,&quot; she offers, just as Reed sends another message in our group chat. All I can think of is how we left it last: letting the chance of starting anew decay over four years of college. It never had a title, but the split was worse than any other relationship I&apos;ve been in.</p><p>&emsp;My mind is abuzz on the car ride home, so distracted the dark dissolves my sight of the exit gate, and I nearly ram it. I should be happy, but I feel some kind of sadness overtake me, and by the third light, I can feel my eyes well with tears. Maybe it&apos;s how fast the four weeks since moving in have gone. Maybe it&apos;s this unstructured emptiness into which my life retreats. Like Newton said about forces and stuff in motion, I feel like if nothing else ever acted on me, I&apos;d float in this job at this level and at this social vapidness until I hit the mahogany wood of my coffin.</p><p>&emsp;I don&apos;t know how Reed or my late brother Jackie seem to find it. That energy to reach beyond, and every time I reach the end of this line of thinking, I wish it was the one lesson my older brother could have passed down to me.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I toss my keys on the counter: the house is a moderate mess when my parents aren&apos;t coming the day after.

I&apos;ve spent so many hours between renders imagining how I would boost the performance if IT gave me a blank check and I was then the bottleneck &mdash; although a workstation laptop is nice to take home, it has nothing over one of those stationary rigs that the Robinson-Monroe lifers were grandfathered into.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.2\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;They gave me the laptop two years ago, and it hasn&apos;t been updated since. One day I booted into BIOS to see if I could overclock it, or take it to its limits. But IT&apos;s Great Wall of Control knows no bounds, so all I can do is sit here for twenty minutes at a time before I notice the changes in the drawing are applied.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.3\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Those twenty minutes are silent. Only Wilbur and I sit in the row, and we&apos;re not even across from each other. Reed filled in the spot that the last escapee left behind, and although I was eager for months to move next to Kei and take the next steps, Navesh insisted it was a &quot;major waste of time.&quot; I feel like Wilbur and I have exhausted every topic across the generational gap: his kids, when I plan to marry, if I have a serious girlfriend yet, cars, and sports. Every day I hear his wake apnea over the partitions, and sometimes I wonder if it&apos;s the perfect cover for him to be sleeping.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.4\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The computer still holds an hourglass. It&apos;s midday, and the neighboring row is filled with chatter. I hear Reed&apos;s voice the most often, and a little too often: if golden retrievers could design and code, and the connotation didn&apos;t imply he was stupid, I think it would fit him well. Kei acknowledges his musings here and there, but is always so focused that she spits no more than a couple words.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.5\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I check the calendar in the lower right corner of my screen. Fall is fast approaching, and when I count, it&apos;s been almost four weeks since I moved in. Four weekends of my parents coming over to visit, bringing over one of my favorite home-cooked meals, allowing them to ask when they&apos;ll have grandkids now that I have a house. Four weeks since I lost my brother&apos;s classic IPod, so now I listen to music on my phone. But also four weeks without drinking: most days I just go home, spend an hour on the computer scrolling my list of games, trying to convince myself to play something, and then go to sleep early unless I go to the gym with Miguel.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.6\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Reed keeps rambling on about sports and hobbies, and the more I just sit there &mdash; helpless to walk over or else I&apos;ll look lonely and desperate &mdash; the more I wonder if I&apos;m getting the right dose of meds. The longer time drags, and the later into my twenties it gets, the further I feel from the spurious passion of those college years where it was forced out of me. It&apos;s like being at the bottom of a dark pool, or a distant game of telephone recalling how I last recalled those moments. My vocal cords feel neglected for how little use they get, and like an unmotivated violinist, I&apos;ve been unpracticed for a while.</p>",

        "<p id=\"1.13.1.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Sure, Nav,&quot; I tell him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;We gather in one of the small meeting rooms. I sit first near the door, then Kei and Reed sit together on the far side. Nav makes small talk when he&apos;s plugging in his laptop. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen you at any of the happy hours, Cody,&quot; he says. &quot;The whole team was there last week: what have you been so busy with?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I even got Kei to go once,&quot; Reed says. &quot;And she&apos;s usually busy all the time!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Kei smiles. &quot;Yeah, I guess I can admit last week was a little fun. Even if it&apos;s just talking about guy stuff at a sports bar.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Reed looks at me earnestly. I can tell that he means it. &quot;You should come.&quot; He reminds me of my business major roommates in college, except before I had a legitimate excuse.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Sounds like fun.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Well, tonight&apos;s the night. We were thinking Chili&apos;s,&quot; Nav says. &quot;And you all have been doing great, so I thought I&apos;d buy you all a drink.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Cheers to that!&quot; Reed exclaims, raising an imaginary glass as I take a long draw of an energy drink. Nav flicks on the projector. His screen comes into focus, with a presentation labeled INTERMITTENT APPRENTICE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, BY NAVESH D. PRATEL.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;So I&apos;ve been looking for ways to keep us busy. Things have been rather slow, and with Scott leaving and all &mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Scott&apos;s leaving?&quot; We say in near unison.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Oh, shoot &mdash; I was supposed to wait until Monday, gosh darn it,&quot; he says. &quot;Keep this between us.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.23\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s going to happen?&quot; Kei asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know, with the hiring freeze and all, maybe something will come from within,&quot; Nav says. He winks so hard I think I hear it. &quot;Anyways, on an unrelated note, I have a project to keep you guys busy, instead of vanishing early to go to Starbucks.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Awesome,&quot; Reed says, but literally.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;We spend forever just designing and redesigning what already exists. It&apos;s what most of engineering is if you&apos;re not R and D, after all.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Next slide.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;A 90&apos;s clip-art image of batteries is on the screen, each with little faces, shaking hands like little powered businessmen. I nearly laugh and I have to cover my mouth.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You spend so much time doing redlines as support engineers that you don&apos;t get to feel what it&apos;s like to come up with something. Surely you felt it in college. Maybe you&apos;ve missed it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I nod almost as excitedly as Reed does.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Enclosures, and more enclosures. Modifying dimensions of existing batteries by the smallest hair to please a customer&apos;s plans. Well, I want you all to take a shot at designing something entirely new,&quot; Nav says. &quot;You should know how batteries work from experience, not just designing the stuff they&apos;re housed in.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yes, a million times yes,&quot; Reed says, and even Kei looks slightly invested.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The next slide is a cross-section of a battery scanned from one of the lifers&apos; textbooks, with such hand-drawn beauty there&apos;s no doubt it came from the seventies. I relish that it&apos;s finally something I&apos;m good at, involving all the robotics I love to do in my garage.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.34\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;What happens is a redox reaction, or reduction-oxidation,&quot; Nav says, sounding like my Circuits professor if he was twenty years older. &quot;The anode has electron-rich elements like zinc, so it&apos;s negative. The cathode has elements like silver, so it&apos;s positive, and when you connect a wire from one to the other, you get electron flow.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.35\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Next slide.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.36\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;We typically do nickel-cadmium or lithium-ion, far better than the lead-acid ones. Then there&apos;s nickel-metal-hydride . . .&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.37\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He drones on and on. With the energy drink death-gripped in my hand, I manage to stay awake: Reed can do it without anything. I decide to just wait for the email with the PowerPoint.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.38\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;And, with all these considerations, your task will be to design an optimal battery, given a set volume. You&apos;ll do some theory, then we&apos;ll use the multimillion-dollar battery lab the R&D guys seem to have forgotten about.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.39\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s great,&quot; Reed says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.40\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;How far you go with this project is up to you, and what you take from it is very important. You&apos;ll be doing this between redlines, getting feedback from Senior engineers, so that you design the best battery possible, and safely,&quot; he says, closing his laptop. &quot;We&apos;ll be starting next week. And since it&apos;s Friday, maybe we can talk about it at Happy Hour.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"1.13.1.41\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;We all stand from the table. My foot falls asleep pretzeled on my other leg, so I stumble towards the door last. But before I can exit, Reed stops me.</p>"

        "<p id=\"1.13.2.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She draws close to take a glance, and I catch a smell of familiar perfume from a date long forgotten. &quot;Just enough, I think.&quot;</p>",

I remember the last day of my junior year and her senior year, cleaning the room one last time as the Presidential cabinet, when I felt my heart swell in my chest with the apprehension of whether I was going to make my move. Time was running out. I had waited all year. The door was closed, and when she turned around, I pressed my lips to hers, and she dissolved into me, starting that perfect summer before she went&mdash;</p>",

All I can think of is how we left it last: letting the chance of starting anew decay over four years of college. It never had a title, but the split was worse than any other relationship I&apos;ve been in.</p>",

I should be happy, but I feel some kind of sadness overtake me, and by the third light, I can feel my eyes well with tears. Maybe it&apos;s how fast the four weeks since moving in have gone. Maybe it&apos;s this unstructured emptiness into which my life retreats. Like Newton said about forces and stuff in motion, I feel like if nothing else ever acted on me, I&apos;d float in this job at this level and at this social vapidness until I hit the mahogany wood of my coffin.</p>",

      "<p>&emsp;Words are a currency she can&apos;t afford when her panic sets her over the edge. She speaks in strings of syllables I can&apos;t comprehend, but it&apos;s not her desperate cries that confuse me the most.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s the fact that the last four weeks passed so peacefully. I thought this was all just a dream after that drunken night with Miguel, but the beautiful girl I mistook for a cosplayer chokes on her tears between breaths as she buries her face into my arm.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;ve all abandoned me,&quot; she says. &quot;I failed to . . . he almost died, because . . .&quot; My fingers trace her back until I realize I&apos;m just touching her armor (and it&apos;s doing nothing for her). I gently guide her back against the couch. For every extra breath of air she finds, she shells it out in useless ramblings that drive her further into a panic, tensioning her body inwards as the tears flow from her face.</p><p>&emsp;She tensions her hands  around my arm so strongly that the blood starts seizing in my own limb. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Save your breath,&quot; I tell her. &quot;You have to breathe. Whatever happened has passed, and it&apos;s over now. You&apos;re safe here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But the town&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The town is fine,&quot; I tell her, uncertain of what delusion could cause such a visceral reaction. It was all a fever dream, right? I remember getting sliced across the palm, but I woke up without a scratch. The girl&apos;s my neighbor: just a whacked-out cosplayer. Maybe someone reported her stream to the IRS for tax evasion?</p><p>&emsp;She finds more words as her trembling subsides. &quot;I only came here because . . . I had no other choice, and as much as I wish I never had to see you again . . .&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Excuse me?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I mean . . . as much as I know we hate each other, after&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash; I don&apos;t hate you,&quot; I tell her. But then the semantics of that lucid dream come back to me. The cut in my palm. The kitchen knives she threw at my head. &quot;Not that much, I mean.&quot; And then I remember the gash she sliced in my championship lacrosse stick that got me from freshman benchwarmer to Varsity senior. &quot;I&apos;m just afraid of you. And&mdash;and you piss me off a little, but not that much,&quot; I say, trying to balance the resurgent feelings of vice with a desire for goodwill.</p><p>&emsp;Her stress slides further from panic into sorrow, exchanging less heaving breaths for more tears. She&apos;s dressed entirely in her custom light armor: I&apos;d think she&apos;d only need it above the torso to film a Let&apos;s Play in character, but she&apos;s committed to the part.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey. Let&apos;s get that armor off of you,&quot; I tell her. She reaches for the faux-leather straps on the sides, and when I grab the shoulder pads, I find them oddly cold to the touch.</p><p>&emsp;I try lifting as she lifts her arms, but it&apos;s pretty heavy for light armor. The fabric feels hand-woven, with the smallest imperfections that tell of old-world craftsmanship. It smells of sweat and manual labor. And as I struggle to pull it off her body, I notice the contours of the breastplate are caught on something beneath.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Ow,&quot; she sniffles. &quot;Let me loosen the straps more.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You got this made of actual metal? Cast iron?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What else would stop an arrow?&quot; She asks, holding her breath as I tug harder. Once she finds enough breath to go without it, she exhales completely, and in an instant, I lose my balance and trip over one of the unpacked boxes from four weeks ago.</p><p>&emsp;The entire weight of the armored torso lands on my face when I crash to the floor. My hands cup the meager metal chest contours of modified men&apos;s armor, weighing against my face and smelling of sweat as if I were stuck in a scrum of lacrosse players.</p><p>&emsp;But I can hear her breathe easier without the burden of all that cosplay gear. Her breathless panic makes even more sense when I rid my face of the breastplate, discovering how much she has to contort herself just to fit into the damn thing.</p><p>&emsp;She removes the last of her bindings, far tighter than the &quot;combat corset&quot; that constrains her waist. She pulls at the fabric of the undershirt to circulate air, where two large sweat spots accentuate the shape of her chest.</p><p>&emsp;Her face and golden eyes alone could get a zoomer to watch her stream Excel spreadsheets: if she ditched the immersive armor and went for something less practical, she could be living in a mansion!</p><p>&emsp;I open my mouth to try to distill that compliment into something platonic, but stop when I see the state of her. Her disheveled hair is frayed far past the braid I first saw her with. Crescents dig beneath her eyes, and as she still works at slowing her breaths &mdash; muttering to herself something about &quot;where she is&quot; &mdash; I can see how tired this whole ordeal has made her, and my feelings of malice slip away.</p><p>&emsp;She sits with her head in her hands, tensioning her fingers around her scalp. I&apos;d offer her a hug if I didn&apos;t think she still hated me, so instead, I decide to warm her with something else.</p><p>&emsp;I approach the kitchen, starting the coffee maker to make some hot chocolate my mom left from the old house. I watch her golden eyes peer over the edge of the couch when the heating element starts boiling the water, like my parents&apos; cat when the refrigerator makes ice.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not Starbucks,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;She tilts her head. &quot;What is it doing?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Boiling water?&quot; I answer.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh.&quot; She leans higher, watching the flickering blue LED light with a genuine sense of bewilderment. &quot;So you do have Essence. Why didn&apos;t you use it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Essence?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Essence. To run the mechanism: top off the Essence capacitor. Like a stove, or a fan, or...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It runs on electricity.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Electricity?&quot; She asks. &quot;What a waste. How do you have that much power? And how rich are you to have all this,&quot; she gestures around the living room, &quot;stuff?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She still finds the strength to do her bit, despite whatever wore on her. &quot;I bought most of it at Home Goods and that corner part of Ross without the clothes. I&apos;m far from rich when I have a mortgage hanging over my head now,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You must make a lot of Kine off your inventions.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not yet. I get paid to modify other people&apos;s stuff,&quot; I tell her. My hands reach into the cabinet, finding the old matching mugs Kei and I bought for the Student Government club room. I hesitate over which one to grab, then after the coffee maker pings, I grab my own.</p><p>&emsp;The old coffee maker dispenses the succulent store-bought chocolate into the mug, rising with steam as dots of moisture condense on the blue inner walls of the porcelain. But it doesn&apos;t feel very warm.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. It&apos;s a drink,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;I look at her, puzzled, until she gestures to bring it over.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s an old coffee maker from my parents&apos; house. They got a new Keurig, so they let me have the old one &mdash; the model before it scanned the damn pods to make sure you&apos;re buying theirs. Heating element isn&apos;t great, so hopefully it&apos;s not like drinking chocolate milk.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not a problem,&quot; she says, taking the cup into her hands. I notice a faint glow emanate from beneath the cup as the air warms around her, and in seconds, the cup is steaming again.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s my turn for bewilderment. She catches my expression with a tired glance. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How did you...?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I bend to look beneath the mug, but there&apos;s nothing there. Once I realize it looks like I&apos;m staring directly at her breasts, I bend upright.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What kind of an uncultured bumpkin are you?&quot; She asks. &quot;Life and fire. Humans. You. Me,&quot; she says, raising her right hand to pretend she&apos;s bending fire.</p><p>&emsp;Pretending, right?</p><p>&emsp;I feel the heat first. And then at a point an inch above her palm, a spark transitions into a raging plume of controlled fire, casting the walls in flickering light.</p><p>&emsp;I instinctively reach to see if it&apos;s a hologram. I feel burning heat before she ceases, slapping my hand away.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You grab for fire like you grabbed for that dagger,&quot; she says. &quot;Pray tell, what kind of stupid idiot savant are you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I stammer over my words. My mind races through every physics and thermodynamics textbook I&apos;ve ever skimmed for problem sets, and can&apos;t find any explanation. The sudden wave of confusion is so strong that I sit down on the box I tripped on moments earlier. &quot;Sweet Carnot,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Is that one of your gods?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;If you design cars and airplanes,&quot; I say. &quot;What the fuck?&quot; And then I gesture to her. &quot;Do it again. How did you do that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m too damn tired, she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do it,&quot; I insist, like a child at a birthday magic show.</p><p>&emsp;She casts it again as she takes her first sip from the mug, careful to watch if I&apos;ll try and reach for it again, but I raise my hands.</p><p>&emsp;Her eyes light with delight. It seems like an emotion she hasn&apos;t felt in a long time.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is really good,&quot; she says. &quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hot chocolate. From the grocery store. But really, though. How did you&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She takes another loud sip. &quot;I usually hate sweet stuff. But this is nice.&quot; She warms it further with her hands: the mug glows with conductive heat, and then she drinks all the rest of it in a single swallow.</p><p>&emsp;Now I have my head in my hands, unsure whether I really want to know the secret behind her sleight-of-hand.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You really have never seen this before? Even a child can make a spark,&quot; she insists, reclining back into the couch as her eyes feather on the edge of exhausted sleep.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not a damn child,&quot; I tell her. &quot;It&apos;s not real. You can&apos;t just...&quot; but then I realize she&apos;s fading away on the couch: it must be comfortable if it makes Miguel fade away this easily, too.</p><p>&emsp;I take the mug by the handle and rinse it in the sink. The red-hot bottom evaporates the first volume of water to steam before it normalizes, and I flip it upside-down into the dish organizer, since I haven&apos;t run the dishwasher in a week and I can&apos;t remember if it&apos;s all dirty or not. On the bottom, I inspect the words I wrote almost a decade earlier.</p><p>&emsp;STU GOV KING + QUEEN</p><p>&emsp;2016</p><p>&emsp;She breathes so softly on the couch that I almost forget she&apos;s there. And when I approach, I find her deep in sleep: sweating again, muttering something about a cabin as her right hand searches for something.</p><p>&emsp;She mutters a name. </p><p>&emsp;I don&apos;t hear it. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Stay,&quot; she asks, as tears crest again in her eyes, and I sit on the box again, as her hand feels for something like fronds of a flower feeling for the sun, finding its way to mine.</p>And once it finds me, it refuses to let go.",
      "<p>&emsp;I wake again from dreams of fire. My hand is always first to feel for the other side of the bed, but my fingers are already laced in something.</p><p>&emsp;I long so deeply for something warm to hold. I want the heat to quell my panic, to overwrite the memories and feelings that sensation brings with something warm that&apos;s better. The cabin is collapsing again: no windows or doors, just a hot box of logs crumbling under the weight of my father&apos;s weakness, and I can feel my own muscles tension further in whatever I can grab to ease the pain. </p><p>&emsp;My eyes feather open to the light of an unfamiliar sun. The birds sound different. The space smells like the industrial quarter of Northaven, and when I feel the sensation of feathers against my neck, I wonder if I squeezed another pillow so hard that the stuffing came out.</p><p>&emsp;But it&apos;s the hair of a man. Not my man. But a man that mumbles something with his face buried between my breasts as I tension him further.</p><p>&emsp;When I release him, he gasps, and I notice the spread of blankets on the floor. One of the couch&apos;s pillows is on the ground, and a scrounging of scavenged blankets makes a meager bed. His face is flushed with a mix of several dissimilar emotions he can&apos;t resolve, and mine flushes further when I realize what I&apos;ve done.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Y-you know how lucky you are that it&apos;s a Saturday?&quot; he says. &quot;I could barely reach for enough to make a bed to get a couple hours of sleep! Then pulling me in like that? And I don&apos;t even know your name,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Katiya Breakey-Hilde. And you&apos;re . . . Cody?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, wiping the sweat from my chest off both sides of his face. &quot;At least I had my phone with me. I ordered us something: you can pay me later.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I look at the laughable spread of blankets and bedsheets again, more concerned about the duress I put him under. &quot;You could have let go. I mean, you don&apos;t even know me. Why didn&apos;t you force my hand away and get a good night of sleep?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;His voice quiets on a hint of humiliation. &quot;Well, you know, you were crying and all. Said not to leave, again and again, and your grip is pretty strong, so...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So you didn&apos;t leave,&quot; I say. Something makes me want to tear up again when a strange sense of relief approaches, but I&apos;m done being weak and sentimental. &quot;Well, thank you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. But you can do me a favor and take a shower?&quot; he asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Excuse me?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It smells like you haven&apos;t showered in a week,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I can&apos;t afford a shower,&quot; I tell him. &quot;I went in the lake last week, then took a bath, like, four days ago.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Really? You can afford to shower. It&apos;s not like the drought three years ago.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Can&apos;t afford A SHOWER,&quot; I clarify, gathering my things like a mistress of the night.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It comes with the damn unit!&quot; Cody exclaims. &quot;How could you possibly not have a shower? There were only two options in the builder&apos;s package. Either Mantequilla, or&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Wait,&quot; I say, putting my hand to his mouth. A shadow approaches the door of his house that&apos;s so immaculate and messy at the same time. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Probably just the delivery driver,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s not a knocker.&quot; I reach for the knife I kept hidden in the side holster of my breastplate, ready to pounce as soon as the adversary blasts open the door. Cody is too weak to defend himself.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yo, chill! Chill out. Look,&quot; he says, showing me a brightly-lit device with far more little colored squares than the music box. A cartoon of an automobile is on the screen, dancing around the center of a map. &quot;You don&apos;t have to stab first and ask questions later, soldier girl.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And you don&apos;t have to grab fire and blades, foolish boy,&quot; I respond.</p><p>&emsp;He cracks the door. I rise to my feet and find the footing to attack, but when the door opens, some bearded guy with earrings and fancy glasses hands a bag to him. Cody mutters some question about whether the tip of something is in an app, and then he nods, allowing him to close the door, and when I catch a glimpse of the scene beyond the door, I realize again that it looks nothing like Gaffesend.</p><p>&emsp;I rush to the window, throwing open the shades. &quot;Where is this? Where are you? And where&apos;s the lake?&quot; I ask. I begin to think it&apos;s all a ruse to trap me at my weakest.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A couple blocks down. You think I could afford lakeside in this economy?&quot; He asks. &quot;But the walk is nice.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Before he can hand me something from the bag, I race back across the threshold of my door, only to find my world the same way I left it. From my window, Gaffesend is abuzz with the week&apos;s end sight of commoners strolling on the cobblestone streets.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya,&quot; Cody calls. &quot;Do you want your tacos or not?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody,&quot; I say. &quot;This is...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He crosses the threshold of the door, finding the same sight he must have thought was just a dream. Now he rushes to my window, watching the water reflect in the light of an early-morning sun.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m glad he put the bag down in the other world. He clutches his chest, short of breath, and I think the man of science is finally beginning to understand that the world is not as measurable as he thinks.</p><p>&emsp;His face flushes white as if he&apos;s seen a Chymaeran fleshwalker. I have to catch him before he falls, and I grab him by the space between his arms.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You weren&apos;t &mdash; you mean that&mdash;&quot; Cody tries to struggle from my grasp to walk out my front door for the first time by his own volition, but his clothes are far too strange: they might think he&apos;s a Chymaeran spy, or ask his noble heritage.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Stop resisting,&quot; I command, hugging him to my chest. I realize I&apos;m speaking my own tongue now, and he&apos;s speaking mine, and I say, &quot;seriously, can you stop fighting me when I&apos;m trying to help you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do it again,&quot; he says, slumping in dead weight before he collects himself, rising to his feet half a head taller than me. &quot;Do the fire trick again.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I roll my eyes. &quot;It&apos;s not a trick, Cody.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do it,&quot; he says, then adds, &quot;please,&quot; staring at me with his dark brown eyes.</p><p>&emsp;I light a simple flame. He looks on with such stupid, childlike captivation that I wonder what other dumb banality could capture his attention.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Holy shit,&quot; he says. &quot;And how do you do that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Watch this,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;I direct the energy to form a loop of flame, spinning around my palm. And some of the other stupid tricks the cadets used to come up with. &quot;So can we eat now?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess it will never get cold,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So you live your whole life without Essence?&quot; I ask him. &quot;So you&apos;re some kind of purist monk?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He responds in my tongue again without noticing he&apos;s doing it. &quot;No Essence at all. Just electricity: there&apos;s no magic in our world.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But what about the cars?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A four-stroke engine that runs on dead dinosaurs.&quot; I don&apos;t catch the meaning of the last word, but my mind associates it with creatures from an eternity ago. He clarifies. &quot;Gasoline. Hydrocarbons from crude oil.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s as if the world wasn&apos;t made for you. As if your world never had the blessings of the Gods.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We don&apos;t know if there is a god, beyond money and power,&quot; Cody says. &quot;They certainly haven&apos;t introduced themselves in person.&quot;</p>&quot;Well, let&apos;s eat,&quot; I insist. &quot;Before it gets cold, or before I have to warm it up again.&quot;"

        "<p id=\"2.15.1.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I try lifting as she lifts her arms, but it&apos;s pretty heavy for light armor.

        "<p id=\"2.15.1.47\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I feel the heat first. And then at a point an inch above her palm, a spark transitions into a raging plume of controlled fire, casting the walls in flickering light.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.15.1.50\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I stammer over my words. My mind races through every physics and thermodynamics textbook I&apos;ve ever skimmed for problem sets, and can&apos;t find any explanation. The sudden wave of confusion is so strong that I sit down on the box I tripped on moments earlier. &quot;Sweet Carnot,&quot; I say.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.15.1.53\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I&apos;m too damn tired, she says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.1.54\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Do it,&quot; I insist, like a child at a birthday magic show.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.1.55\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She casts it again as she takes her first sip from the mug, careful to watch if I&apos;ll try and reach for it again, but I raise my hands.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.15.1.58\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Hot chocolate. From the grocery store. But really, though. How did you&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.1.59\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She takes another loud sip. &quot;I usually hate sweet stuff. But this is nice.&quot; She warms it further with her hands: the mug glows with conductive heat, and then she drinks all the rest of it in a single swallow.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.1.60\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Now I have my head in my hands, unsure whether I really want to know the secret behind her sleight-of-hand.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.1.61\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You really have never seen this before? Even a child can make a spark,&quot; she insists, reclining back into the couch as her eyes feather on the edge of exhausted sleep.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.1.62\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not a damn child,&quot; I tell her. &quot;It&apos;s not real. You can&apos;t just...&quot; but then I realize she&apos;s fading away on the couch: it must be comfortable if it makes Miguel fade away this easily, too.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.1.63\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I take the mug by the handle and rinse it in the sink. The red-hot bottom evaporates the first volume of water to steam before it normalizes, and I flip it upside-down into the dish organizer, since I haven&apos;t run the dishwasher in a week and I can&apos;t remember if it&apos;s all dirty or not. On the bottom, I inspect the words I wrote almost a decade earlier.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.15.2.1\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I wake again from dreams of fire. My hand is always first to feel for the other side of the bed, but my fingers are already laced in something.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.2\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I long so deeply for something warm to hold. I want the heat to quell my panic, to overwrite the memories and feelings that sensation brings with something warm that&apos;s better. The cabin is collapsing again: no windows or doors, just a hot box of logs crumbling under the weight of my father&apos;s weakness, and I can feel my own muscles tension further in whatever I can grab to ease the pain. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.3\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My eyes feather open to the light of an unfamiliar sun. The birds sound different. The space smells like the industrial quarter of Northaven, and when I feel the sensation of feathers against my neck, I wonder if I squeezed another pillow so hard that the stuffing came out.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.4\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But it&apos;s the hair of a man. Not my man. But a man that mumbles something with his face buried between my breasts as I tension him further.</p>",

One of the couch&apos;s pillows is on the ground, and a scrounging of scavenged blankets makes a meager bed. His face is flushed with a mix of several dissimilar emotions he can&apos;t resolve, and mine flushes further when I realize what I&apos;ve done.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.6\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Y-you know how lucky you are that it&apos;s a Saturday?&quot; he says. &quot;I could barely reach for enough to make a bed to get a couple hours of sleep! Then pulling me in like that? And I don&apos;t even know your name,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.7\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Katiya,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Katiya Breakey-Hilde. And you&apos;re . . . Cody?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.8\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, wiping the sweat from my chest off both sides of his face. &quot;At least I had my phone with me. I ordered us something: you can pay me later.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.9\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I look at the laughable spread of blankets and bedsheets again, more concerned about the duress I put him under. &quot;You could have let go. I mean, you don&apos;t even know me. Why didn&apos;t you force my hand away and get a good night of sleep?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.10\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;His voice quiets on a hint of humiliation. &quot;Well, you know, you were crying and all. Said not to leave, again and again, and your grip is pretty strong, so...&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.11\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;So you didn&apos;t leave,&quot; I say. Something makes me want to tear up again when a strange sense of relief approaches, but I&apos;m done being weak and sentimental. &quot;Well, thank you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.12\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Sure. But you can do me a favor and take a shower?&quot; he asks.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.15.2.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Really? You can afford to shower. It&apos;s not like the drought three years ago.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.15.2.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Wait,&quot; I say, putting my hand to his mouth. A shadow approaches the door of his house that&apos;s so immaculate and messy at the same time. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Probably just the delivery driver,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.21\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s not a knocker.&quot; I reach for the knife I kept hidden in the side holster of my breastplate, ready to pounce as soon as the adversary blasts open the door. Cody is too weak to defend himself.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.22\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Yo, chill! Chill out. Look,&quot; he says, showing me a brightly-lit device with far more little colored squares than the music box. A cartoon of an automobile is on the screen, dancing around the center of a map. &quot;You don&apos;t have to stab first and ask questions later, soldier girl.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.23\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And you don&apos;t have to grab fire and blades, foolish boy,&quot; I respond.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He cracks the door. I rise to my feet and find the footing to attack, but when the door opens, some bearded guy with earrings and fancy glasses hands a bag to him. Cody mutters some question about whether the tip of something is in an app, and then he nods, allowing him to close the door, and when I catch a glimpse of the scene beyond the door, I realize again that it looks nothing like Gaffesend.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I rush to the window, throwing open the shades. &quot;Where is this? Where are you? And where&apos;s the lake?&quot; I ask. I begin to think it&apos;s all a ruse to trap me at my weakest.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;A couple blocks down. You think I could afford lakeside in this economy?&quot; He asks. &quot;But the walk is nice.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.27\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Before he can hand me something from the bag, I race back across the threshold of my door, only to find my world the same way I left it. From my window, Gaffesend is abuzz with the week&apos;s end sight of commoners strolling on the cobblestone streets.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.28\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Katiya,&quot; Cody calls. &quot;Do you want your tacos or not?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.29\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Cody,&quot; I say. &quot;This is...&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.30\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He crosses the threshold of the door, finding the same sight he must have thought was just a dream. Now he rushes to my window, watching the water reflect in the light of an early-morning sun.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I&apos;m glad he put the bag down in the other world. He clutches his chest, short of breath, and I think the man of science is finally beginning to understand that the world is not as measurable as he thinks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.32\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;His face flushes white as if he&apos;s seen a Chymaeran fleshwalker. I have to catch him before he falls, and I grab him by the space between his arms.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.33\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You weren&apos;t &mdash; you mean that&mdash;&quot; Cody tries to struggle from my grasp to walk out my front door for the first time by his own volition, but his clothes are far too strange: they might think he&apos;s a Chymaeran spy, or ask his noble heritage.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.34\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Stop resisting,&quot; I command, hugging him to my chest. I realize I&apos;m speaking my own tongue now, and he&apos;s speaking mine, and I say, &quot;seriously, can you stop fighting me when I&apos;m trying to help you?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.35\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Do it again,&quot; he says, slumping in dead weight before he collects himself, rising to his feet half a head taller than me. &quot;Do the fire trick again.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.36\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I roll my eyes. &quot;It&apos;s not a trick, Cody.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.37\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Do it,&quot; he says, then adds, &quot;please,&quot; staring at me with his dark brown eyes.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.38\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I light a simple flame. He looks on with such stupid, childlike captivation that I wonder what other dumb banality could capture his attention.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.39\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Holy shit,&quot; he says. &quot;And how do you do that?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.40\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Watch this,&quot; I say. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.41\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I direct the energy to form a loop of flame, spinning around my palm. And some of the other stupid tricks the cadets used to come up with. &quot;So can we eat now?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.42\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I guess it will never get cold,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.43\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;So you live your whole life without Essence?&quot; I ask him. &quot;So you&apos;re some kind of purist monk?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.44\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He responds in my tongue again without noticing he&apos;s doing it. &quot;No Essence at all. Just electricity: there&apos;s no magic in our world.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.45\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But what about the cars?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.46\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;A four-stroke engine that runs on dead dinosaurs.&quot; I don&apos;t catch the meaning of the last word, but my mind associates it with creatures from an eternity ago. He clarifies. &quot;Gasoline. Hydrocarbons from crude oil.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.15.2.47\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s as if the world wasn&apos;t made for you. As if your world never had the blessings of the Gods.&quot;</p>",

      "<p>&emsp;I never knew it was possible to misunderstand a taco. It seems pretty obvious that it&apos;s tall and narrow. That you have to rotate the thing sideways to put it in your mouth to take a bite, but Katiya wedged her teeth between the middle of the shell, taking bites like a chipmunk as she complained that the shell might spill it all.</p><p>&emsp;Nor did I ever consider how the taste of processed food might be too much for someone that eats an antiquated diet of fruit and bread and meat, taken aback by how salted the ground beef was, though she liked gnashing her teeth on the crunch of the shell when she finally figured out that she had to turn her head.</p><p>&emsp;I let her stop there, hiding the soda I got for her in the fridge in fear that the carbonation might make it shoot out of her nose.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You said you don&apos;t have plans, right?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I got two whole days for all this to boil over,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But your friend&mdash;Bertram? What about him?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I got a telegram that he&apos;s stable,&quot; she says, &quot;so it will be a little while before I see him again.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Telegram,&quot; I repeat. &quot;And your boyfriend? Julian?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d think he would check on you after all that, don&apos;t you think? He should care about you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Katiya&apos;s eyes narrow. &quot;I think he&apos;s ashamed of me, or something.&quot; I ball my fists. She notices, and tries to defend him. &quot;But I really, really messed up.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You told me. But I think people that love you should love you through anything, you know?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She tucks her arms together in her hands as if she could ever shiver. &quot;I just don&apos;t really want to talk about it,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then how about we get to your &apos;rest day?&apos;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A rest day?&quot; She glares at me, disgusted. But from the tone of her body, I guess it takes some kind of psycho to be that well-conditioned.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A day to recover before you get back to . . . whatever it is you do. I thought it was streaming, but if you&apos;re really a city guard, then that explains a lot.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Probational city guard,&quot; she clarifies, as if I should care.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cool.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But I think first &mdash; we should set some ground rules for sharing this space.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; I say. &quot;Leave it to the city guard to go rambling on about making laws.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But seriously,&quot; she says, beaming a look of sincerity through her actually-amber eyes. &quot;We have to set boundaries or else things could worsen.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess, but do we have to do that right now? Let&apos;s put it off. It&apos;s the weekend.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t do week&apos;s ends,&quot; she states, in a sinister voice that almost raises gooseflesh on my arms.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; I tell her, raising my hands, feeling like a complete couch potato. &quot;We&apos;ll go for a drive later, then. So: where&apos;s your quill and ink, so we can write up this document? Did you pluck the pheasant for a fresh tip?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We have pens, you nonce,&quot; Katiya says.</p><p>&emsp;I grab an old notebook from engineering school and flip it to an empty page near the back. I grab a pen from the ground, only to realize it&apos;s one of Miguel&apos;s disposable vape pens he forgot to pick up.</p><p>&emsp;Katiya laughs, muttering something.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What was that?&quot; I demand.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like a child,&quot; she says. &quot;With all your fancy science, your children don&apos;t learn to write without lines?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Piss off,&quot; I tell her. And then I add, &quot;Maybe if your world could come up with half this shit instead of relying on Essence, you&apos;d be able to buy a shower instead of using mine,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Maybe that&apos;s the first rule.&quot; I reach for an actual pen in one of the boxes. &quot;Don&apos;t ever get too comfortable with the other world&apos;s stuff, though that&apos;s probably more for you, right?&quot;</p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>01. Never depend on the other world&apos;s things.</span></p><p>&emsp;&quot;You haven&apos;t been introduced to any of my world&apos;s amenities yet,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And what else?&quot; I scribble circles in the corner of the page.</p><p>&emsp;She looks at the couch before looking at me, probably remembering an hour ago when she hugged my head to the space between her breasts. &quot;And no sleeping over in the other world. Ever,&quot; she says. </p><p>&emsp;I write it on the third line in block letters. </p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>02. Never spend the night in the other world.</span></p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why all capital letters? Are you writing in the voice of an angry god, giving commandments?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I say, taking my time to write out the line. &quot;And I have a third one: it&apos;s a two-parter. No bringing people across the threshold from your world. And no telling anyone about any of this.&quot;</p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>03. No one else can cross the threshold.</span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>04. No one else can know about the door.</span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>She adds another one about loud music and sound, as if I didn&apos;t already live around old people. And I add one about using my utilities excessively. And bringing weapons in here. She adds one about being in her world dressed as strangely as I am now, and I counter with a corollary saying she can&apos;t dress like an e-girl unless it&apos;s Halloween or the Renaissance Faire. She says not to go out in Gaffesend without her. I say she doesn&apos;t have a license, so she shouldn&apos;t go out in my world either.</span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>05. No loud music or sound, especially at night.</span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>06. Don&apos;t burn a hole in Cody&apos;s wallet using his utilities.</span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>07. No weapons in Cody&apos;s world.</span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>08. Thou shalt dress like a commoner when in the other person&apos;s world. No out-of-place clothes.</span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>09. NEVER go out alone in the other world.</span></p><p>&emsp;&quot;And last of all,&quot; she says, thirty minutes later, &quot;is the most important.&quot; I have space for one more before I&apos;d have to flip over the page. &quot;Our worlds are meant to be apart. So we can&apos;t ever get together.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like hang out?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, you idiot,&quot; she says. Her cheeks are a little redder. &quot;Like, get together, you know. Love. Fall in love.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. Oh, no,&quot; I say. &quot;I already have someone I like. And you have that guy.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Jullian,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say, shaking off the sweat in my palm before I finish off the page. It&apos;s strange how she detests that four-letter word so much: probably something about weakness.</p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>10. Never fall for each other. Ever.</span></p><p>&emsp; &quot;Okay. Is that enough?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;For now,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about &apos;have fun?&apos;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Fun isn&apos;t common in my world,&quot; she says, sternly again. &quot;Sloth is a fatal sin that kills you at a young age.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Christ. Calm down, Nietzsche,&quot; I tell her. &quot;We&apos;re going to be having fun going for a drive, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just want to understand your world. It&apos;s dangerous to me. So just understand,&quot; she insists, &quot;that&apos;s all.&quot;</p>&quot;Whatever you say,&quot; I tell her, grabbing the keys to my car and heading for the garage.",
      "<p>&emsp;He spends a near ten minutes trying to find twenty different ways to demand that I sit in the exact same place without touching anything. That I&apos;m safe. That I can&apos;t possibly get hurt, regardless of how fast we go. That anything foreign and strange and big and too impossibly smooth is there for a reason, and that nothing is going wrong unless he says it is, and that he&apos;ll surely bring it up if things are even slightly bad.</p><p>&emsp;He doesn&apos;t press the glowing switch on the wall for a reason, facing the large metal door that looks like it isn&apos;t supposed to open from the sides. The automobile is so smooth and metallic: shinier than my greatsword, and probably one of the shiny things he told me not to touch.</p><p>&emsp;But he instructs me to enter. Then he looks down at my feet and realizes I&apos;m wearing steel boots, and demands more of me, telling me to lace up a pair of his &quot;trainers&quot; though they look nothing like shoes of war.</p><p>&emsp;And once my feet fill the space like two parishioners in a grand chapel to the Gods, he tells me to GENTLY! pull the handle, afraid of my strength.</p><p>&emsp;I sit in the car on the comfortable seat, wondering why everything is so soft in this world that you could fall asleep on it: even the people, from the kind of food Cody&apos;s shown me so far. And then he presses a button on a wide mirror that opens the door to this car room: sounding off with a loud rumble of a generator that nearly sets me into panic.</p><p>&emsp;He reassures me that it&apos;s all okay. But then something flashes on his automobile&apos;s front thing about blue teeth being connected, and I hear the loudest sound I&apos;ve ever heard: one that gives me such a start that I notice it gives him a start, and according to his original rules, that means that I should panic.</p><p>&emsp;His hand slams against the circular knob as I almost drive my fist against the glowing screen, but he deflects my hand just in time. He wags his finger several times at me before pulling out his cellular telephone to change something, saying that music about metal is probably too much for me, that he was just at the gym.</p><p>&emsp;I ask him what they&apos;re yelling about. He says he doesn&apos;t really know, but that it gets him &quot;amped&quot; at the gymnasium, and chooses some other thing that tells the sonograph to play another tune.</p><p>&emsp;He backs out of the space slowly. His eyes flicker between my face and the edge of the car port that&apos;s close to the metal door, and I nearly slam my head against the front with the sudden change in inertia.</p><p>&emsp;He presses his left arm against my shoulders, telling me to relax. And when he&apos;s beginning to second-guess himself of this whole plan, saying that he&apos;s only &quot;adding fuel to the fire that is my anxiety,&quot; and that I&apos;m never going to relax at this rate.</p><p>&emsp;I tell him I&apos;m not made to relax, and that I&apos;ve faced worse than his soft world with all these rounded edges could ever throw at him.</p><p>&emsp;So we back out of the driveway. I tense my legs and feet against the bottom of the car to make sure my back is always against the soft chair, and when he makes his first full quarter-turn backwards into the street, something closes the big steel door.</p><p>&emsp;He asks if I&apos;m alright. I ask if he&apos;s going to stop asking if I&apos;m alright, and when my eyes look up from my legs to take in the view beyond the warped front glass, I see a marvel of architecture in front of my eyes.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s like the town of Gaffesend with all its row-houses, but cleaner and sharper. There are children here that play in the street: the young ones at least, the older ones sit in the corners on telephones like the one that Cody has, laughing at something as they share it with each other. One man sprays a dedicated stream of water from a hose to wet his plants. There are so many other cars that sit all across the road: behind the car garages, on the streets off to the side, so many that I wonder if they have cars this comfortable, why they would need a house in the first place. </p><p>&emsp;I wonder aloud. It makes Cody laugh pretty hard, and he manages to collect himself by the first red octagon with the words STOP written across it.</p><p>&emsp;I don&apos;t allow the inertia to surprise me this time. But the right turn does, and I lean so far into Cody that I have to stabilize myself by grabbing his right leg, causing him to slam the brake and throw himself forward.</p><p>&emsp;He barks at me, but without bite, gesturing to a handle attached to the top edge of the car, something he calls the &quot;oh-shit handle,&quot; insisting I grab it until I get my bearing. Several seconds later, he changes his mind and tells me not to, afraid I might rip it off the roof.</p><p>&emsp;But I&apos;m too amazed by the sights to tense my body for any turns. When the view of houses opens up after a couple turns, and the musical automobile climbs a slight hill, I catch a fuller view of the city: spanning so far that my eyes can&apos;t count the number of buildings. Not a single stretch of farmland is anywhere: just buildings erected from the colors of nature around them; shiny points of light that shimmer in the mountains; large balloons of color with people in them that hover above the lake.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And none of this is Essence,&quot; I ask. </p><p>&emsp;And Cody nods with ease.</p><p>&emsp;My mind doesn&apos;t even know what to process from what my eyes observe, like the late-night lectures in school when all the cadets are too tired to retain anything. My chest stirs with an animated lightness unlike anything I think I&apos;ve ever felt before, except maybe when I was a young child, and although it scares me &mdash; and it&apos;s probably a little from Cody as the operator &mdash; I feel an odd calmness when I&apos;m next to him, listening to the faint voice he tries to hide when he sings the words to the songs he likes.</p><p>&emsp;The cabin is pleasantly cool despite how hot it might be out there. He gestures to a part of the car that shows a number that resembles the temperature, instead of a thermometer.</p><p>&emsp;I bring my head close to the air conditioning. He asks if I really want to have my hair blown, and lowers the window, filling the space with a deafening gust of air until he lowers his window, telling me to reach my hand beyond the cabin.</p><p>&emsp;We race so fast that the air floods through my fingers like water in a stream, and I realize I&apos;m laughing, but I don&apos;t stop myself too much. We get on the highway, and though he&apos;s apprehensive of whether I&apos;ll try to slice the seat belt and jump out the window, I find it amazing: thrilling that any person could have such an ease of access to the sensation of speed.</p><p>&emsp;There are so many other people of this world inside these cars that I wave at them, but Cody tells me not to. He then demands that I &quot;don&apos;t speak to anyone yet&quot; and &quot;don&apos;t call anything anything to anyone&quot; and to &quot;mask my surprise a little&quot; when we get to our destination.</p><p>&emsp;We get off the highway and end up on slower and smaller roads for a while, stopping at crossroads where some light operator tells us when we can drive. One fellow blares his horn really loud, enough to anger Cody to use some gesture on him, speaking words I can&apos;t yet fully understand, but he calms down when he remembers that I&apos;m here, saying he &quot;forgot that I could smite them.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We end up on a wide square of painted lines in organized rows. Cody stops the automobile between two pairs of them, between two other cars, and instructs me to CAREFULLY! open the car door and not touch the other car door next to me.</p><p>&emsp;I step out into the space between cars, my stomach a little twisted, but my body feeling light. He gestures to a big building with a word that doesn&apos;t translate, because he says it&apos;s a company called Costco, and that they have more stuff to eat and wear and buy than I could ever imagine.</p><p>&emsp;I can feel a hint of the panic set in when I realize I&apos;m surrounded by other commoners of his world for the first time. I&apos;d retreat back into the car if Cody didn&apos;t coax me out by gently grabbing my shirt, telling me that if I stick with him, I&apos;ll be fine.</p><p>&emsp;He offers his hand to me, and I hesitate. But right when I&apos;m about to take it, he pulls away, apologizing, saying that I can walk right next to him.</p><p>&emsp;He points to a row of metal baskets, telling me to grab one. I lift it by the side. His face flushes in secondhand embarrassment when he shows me that there are wheels on the bottom for a reason, and though the wheels are halfway to my waist, I drop the cart as people stare.</p><p>&emsp;He says it&apos;s fine, drawing into his pockets for a small card with patterned lines on it, saying something about hot dogs and some guy that raises them for cheap, instructing me to push the cart as we enter the big warehouse, making sure that I don&apos;t make eye contact with anyone.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;&quot;Just try not to make too much eye contact with anyone,&quot; Cody says. &quot;They already think you do dress-up from the color your eyes are.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But how could they? Are there any other races here?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just humans,&quot; Cody says. &quot;So boring and dissimilar we call different skin colors different races, can you believe that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I tell him, pushing the cart by its wheels instead of lifting it by the side.</p><p>&emsp;The store is so flooded with people that it reminds me of my late childhood in the capital. But it seems that all the vendors are owned by the same people &mdash; the dog guy that Cody was talking about.</p><p>&emsp;I spot three exits to the building in case anything happens, Cody tugs the cart past the massive screens, showcasing views of other worlds so real you can&apos;t even see the tiny little dots of color, and I begin to wonder whether it&apos;s a doorway like the one between our homes.</p><p>&emsp;But Cody reads my mind. &quot;Not a portal,&quot; he says. &quot;Those are televisions.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Where do they go?&quot; I ask. &quot;I thought you had to project the pictures from a box.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nowhere. You&apos;d probably get electrocuted if you stuck your head in there,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;He goads me onward, passing an array of smaller screens in the telephone format that Cody has, called Smartphones, filled with so much knowledge it&apos;s like the Verdala and their network of wisdom trees.</p><p>&emsp;I try not making eye contact, but it&apos;s unfathomable to see a crowd of people without a single cat-eared Ahkvasan or mixed-race person. And to think they all have no Essence at all: something that terrifies me if I imagine they were invaded.</p><p>&emsp;I try to spin up some conversation instead of asking Cody foolish questions. &quot;Say, who is that girl that you admire?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Which one?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The mug girl,&quot; I say. &quot;From work.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He laughs. &quot;Mug girl. You mean Kei?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, Kei,&quot; I say. &quot;How are things with her?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;His grasp tightens around the mesh of the cart as I push it. &quot;I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m not really sure,&quot; he says. &quot;We used to be really close: we kissed, even. Things were getting good, then she left for college because she was a year ahead of me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I ask, &quot;Did you have intercourse with this woman?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody convulses, grabbing my shoulder before he realizes we&apos;re alone in the aisle. He sighs. &quot;Katiya. You can&apos;t just talk about that out loud,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why not?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because people aren&apos;t always that open to talking about stuff like that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why should we care?&quot; I ask, sincerely.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because it&apos;s etiquette. Sex, drugs, stuff like that, makes people uncomfortable, so it&apos;s better to talk in private.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then how does anyone have . . . that level of engagement in your society?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s on the phone now,&quot; he whispers. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t just walk up to someone and ask for it, would you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, in the poor parts of Northaven, when&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;Don&apos;t answer that,&quot; he says, taking the cart over from me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So this girl,&quot; I start. &quot;The one you didn&apos;t have,&quot; and I almost laugh, &quot;business with.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He sneers at me. &quot;Yeah. We were too young for that, kind of. And then college was busy &mdash; sleeping around and stuff without anything real, and now the stupid, boring, lonely, real world you&apos;re thrust into after all that, when you have to pay off the student loan and become indebted to a piece of land.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But how could you ever be bored or lonely? Bored of this?&quot; She lifts a kids&apos; drawing kit, and then a card with a Nintendo Switch depicted on it. &quot;And how could you be lonely when you&apos;re literally connected to everyone?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Some passersby overhears her rant, and adds, &quot;You&apos;re goddamn right.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then welcome to the modern age, and the biggest problem we&apos;ve created that we can&apos;t solve,&quot; I tell her, turning the corner of the last aisles on the first side of the store that get into the liquor. &quot;Be glad you&apos;re not included in it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you don&apos;t have to do any of that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not when everybody else does,&quot; I muse. &quot;Imagine if everybody spoke a special language, and you decided not to learn it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then they should speak the old language.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The new language has funny pictures in it, though: or it used to be funny pictures. Now it&apos;s just pictures about depression.&quot; She narrows her eyes, without even the faintest thread of understanding to tug at. &quot;Hell, maybe you should just close the door and never come back.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But look at all this.&quot; She gestures to the rows and rows of produce. Whole chickens and hams wrapped in plastic. People filling their carts with an abundance. &quot;How the Res do your people make all this?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s all science,&quot; I say, grabbing a bagged salad that I&apos;ll buy to feel good about myself and probably forget in the back of the refrigerator. &quot;It&apos;s a world that&apos;s connected everywhere. Not a square inch of land uncharted, and we&apos;ve figured out exactly how to trade stuff with each other.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But what about wars and borders? No new land means it&apos;s a war for what&apos;s there, right?&quot; Katiya lifts a clear carton of cotton candy-flavored grapes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please. Just wait for your world to develop the last weapon it ever will: one that can wipe an entire city off a map. One with such power that it leaves the victims as no more than shaded shadows on the wall, giving the survivors illnesses that carry from generation to generation. Then give those weapons to everyone. And then you&apos;ll understand why we don&apos;t dispute those silly lines we shake hands over,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;I realize I&apos;ve gone a little too far when we&apos;re deciding between colors of grapes. Her jaw hangs open. I get the variety pack so Katiya can take them home with her, and usher her to follow me on to the frozen meals section.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You seem to know a lot about war,&quot; she says. &quot;You seem strong for your world. Did you fight?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I say. &quot;But my brother did.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She hesitates to ask the next question, so I answer for her when we step into the large dairy fridge, feeling the same cold he must have felt when he had the bloody holes in his abdomen. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;But he never came back.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just think that&mdash;&quot; war is, but I stop myself, unwilling to go that far this soon.</p><p>&emsp;Katiya fills the space with her own words. &quot;It must have been hard.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s been hard. It was roughly five years ago. Inspired me to make something in college,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;She looks down at her calloused hands, then traces the faint outline of a scar that spans from her eye down her cheek.</p><p>&emsp;I stop her before the pleasantries. &quot;I&apos;d rather not talk about it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She grasps the mesh of the cart as we walk down the frozen food aisle, maybe feeling again that I detest something about her.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But I need frozen stuff for work,&quot; I say, &quot;and maybe you can get something, too. Have you tried an eggwich?&quot;</p>"

        "<p id=\"2.16.1.49\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No, you idiot,&quot; she says. Her cheeks are a little redder. &quot;Like, get together, you know. Love. Fall in love.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.1.50\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh. Oh, no,&quot; I say. &quot;I already have someone I like. And you have that guy.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.1.51\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Jullian,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.1.52\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say, shaking off the sweat in my palm before I finish off the page. It&apos;s strange how she detests that four-letter word so much: probably something about weakness.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.1.53\" class=\"Cody\"><span class=CodyHand msgnote>10. Never fall for each other. Ever.</span></p>",

        "<p id=\"2.16.1.55\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;For now,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.1.56\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;How about &apos;have fun?&apos;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.1.57\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Fun isn&apos;t common in my world,&quot; she says, sternly again. &quot;Sloth is a fatal sin that kills you at a young age.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.1.58\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Christ. Calm down, Nietzsche,&quot; I tell her. &quot;We&apos;re going to be having fun going for a drive, right?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.1.59\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I just want to understand your world. It&apos;s dangerous to me. So just understand,&quot; she insists, &quot;that&apos;s all.&quot;</p>"

        "<p id=\"2.16.2.1\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He spends a near ten minutes trying to find twenty different ways to demand that I sit in the exact same place without touching anything. That I&apos;m safe. That I can&apos;t possibly get hurt, regardless of how fast we go. That anything foreign and strange and big and too impossibly smooth is there for a reason, and that nothing is going wrong unless he says it is, and that he&apos;ll surely bring it up if things are even slightly bad.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.2\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He doesn&apos;t press the glowing switch on the wall for a reason, facing the large metal door that looks like it isn&apos;t supposed to open from the sides. The automobile is so smooth and metallic: shinier than my greatsword, and probably one of the shiny things he told me not to touch.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.3\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But he instructs me to enter. Then he looks down at my feet and realizes I&apos;m wearing steel boots, and demands more of me, telling me to lace up a pair of his &quot;trainers&quot; though they look nothing like shoes of war.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.4\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;And once my feet fill the space like two parishioners in a grand chapel to the Gods, he tells me to GENTLY! pull the handle, afraid of my strength.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.5\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I sit in the car on the comfortable seat, wondering why everything is so soft in this world that you could fall asleep on it: even the people, from the kind of food Cody&apos;s shown me so far. And then he presses a button on a wide mirror that opens the door to this car room: sounding off with a loud rumble of a generator that nearly sets me into panic.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.6\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He reassures me that it&apos;s all okay. But then something flashes on his automobile&apos;s front thing about blue teeth being connected, and I hear the loudest sound I&apos;ve ever heard: one that gives me such a start that I notice it gives him a start, and according to his original rules, that means that I should panic.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.7\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;His hand slams against the circular knob as I almost drive my fist against the glowing screen, but he deflects my hand just in time. He wags his finger several times at me before pulling out his cellular telephone to change something, saying that music about metal is probably too much for me, that he was just at the gym.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.8\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I ask him what they&apos;re yelling about. He says he doesn&apos;t really know, but that it gets him &quot;amped&quot; at the gymnasium, and chooses some other thing that tells the sonograph to play another tune.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.9\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He backs out of the space slowly. His eyes flicker between my face and the edge of the car port that&apos;s close to the metal door, and I nearly slam my head against the front with the sudden change in inertia.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.10\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He presses his left arm against my shoulders, telling me to relax. And when he&apos;s beginning to second-guess himself of this whole plan, saying that he&apos;s only &quot;adding fuel to the fire that is my anxiety,&quot; and that I&apos;m never going to relax at this rate.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.11\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I tell him I&apos;m not made to relax, and that I&apos;ve faced worse than his soft world with all these rounded edges could ever throw at him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.12\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;So we back out of the driveway. I tense my legs and feet against the bottom of the car to make sure my back is always against the soft chair, and when he makes his first full quarter-turn backwards into the street, something closes the big steel door.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.13\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He asks if I&apos;m alright. I ask if he&apos;s going to stop asking if I&apos;m alright, and when my eyes look up from my legs to take in the view beyond the warped front glass, I see a marvel of architecture in front of my eyes.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;It&apos;s like the town of Gaffesend with all its row-houses, but cleaner and sharper. There are children here that play in the street: the young ones at least, the older ones sit in the corners on telephones like the one that Cody has, laughing at something as they share it with each other. One man sprays a dedicated stream of water from a hose to wet his plants. There are so many other cars that sit all across the road: behind the car garages, on the streets off to the side, so many that I wonder if they have cars this comfortable, why they would need a house in the first place. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I wonder aloud. It makes Cody laugh pretty hard, and he manages to collect himself by the first red octagon with the words STOP written across it.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I don&apos;t allow the inertia to surprise me this time. But the right turn does, and I lean so far into Cody that I have to stabilize myself by grabbing his right leg, causing him to slam the brake and throw himself forward.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He barks at me, but without bite, gesturing to a handle attached to the top edge of the car, something he calls the &quot;oh-shit handle,&quot; insisting I grab it until I get my bearing. Several seconds later, he changes his mind and tells me not to, afraid I might rip it off the roof.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But I&apos;m too amazed by the sights to tense my body for any turns. When the view of houses opens up after a couple turns, and the musical automobile climbs a slight hill, I catch a fuller view of the city: spanning so far that my eyes can&apos;t count the number of buildings. Not a single stretch of farmland is anywhere: just buildings erected from the colors of nature around them; shiny points of light that shimmer in the mountains; large balloons of color with people in them that hover above the lake.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And none of this is Essence,&quot; I ask. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;And Cody nods with ease.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.21\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My mind doesn&apos;t even know what to process from what my eyes observe, like the late-night lectures in school when all the cadets are too tired to retain anything. My chest stirs with an animated lightness unlike anything I think I&apos;ve ever felt before, except maybe when I was a young child, and although it scares me &mdash; and it&apos;s probably a little from Cody as the operator &mdash; I feel an odd calmness when I&apos;m next to him, listening to the faint voice he tries to hide when he sings the words to the songs he likes.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.22\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The cabin is pleasantly cool despite how hot it might be out there. He gestures to a part of the car that shows a number that resembles the temperature, instead of a thermometer.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.23\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I bring my head close to the air conditioning. He asks if I really want to have my hair blown, and lowers the window, filling the space with a deafening gust of air until he lowers his window, telling me to reach my hand beyond the cabin.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We race so fast that the air floods through my fingers like water in a stream, and I realize I&apos;m laughing, but I don&apos;t stop myself too much. We get on the highway, and though he&apos;s apprehensive of whether I&apos;ll try to slice the seat belt and jump out the window, I find it amazing: thrilling that any person could have such an ease of access to the sensation of speed.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;There are so many other people of this world inside these cars that I wave at them, but Cody tells me not to. He then demands that I &quot;don&apos;t speak to anyone yet&quot; and &quot;don&apos;t call anything anything to anyone&quot; and to &quot;mask my surprise a little&quot; when we get to our destination.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We get off the highway and end up on slower and smaller roads for a while, stopping at crossroads where some light operator tells us when we can drive. One fellow blares his horn really loud, enough to anger Cody to use some gesture on him, speaking words I can&apos;t yet fully understand, but he calms down when he remembers that I&apos;m here, saying he &quot;forgot that I could smite them.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.27\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We end up on a wide square of painted lines in organized rows. Cody stops the automobile between two pairs of them, between two other cars, and instructs me to CAREFULLY! open the car door and not touch the other car door next to me.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.28\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I step out into the space between cars, my stomach a little twisted, but my body feeling light. He gestures to a big building with a word that doesn&apos;t translate, because he says it&apos;s a company called Costco, and that they have more stuff to eat and wear and buy than I could ever imagine.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.29\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I can feel a hint of the panic set in when I realize I&apos;m surrounded by other commoners of his world for the first time. I&apos;d retreat back into the car if Cody didn&apos;t coax me out by gently grabbing my shirt, telling me that if I stick with him, I&apos;ll be fine.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.30\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He offers his hand to me, and I hesitate. But right when I&apos;m about to take it, he pulls away, apologizing, saying that I can walk right next to him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He points to a row of metal baskets, telling me to grab one. I lift it by the side. His face flushes in secondhand embarrassment when he shows me that there are wheels on the bottom for a reason, and though the wheels are halfway to my waist, I drop the cart as people stare.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.2.32\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He says it&apos;s fine, drawing into his pockets for a small card with patterned lines on it, saying something about hot dogs and some guy that raises them for cheap, instructing me to push the cart as we enter the big warehouse, making sure that I don&apos;t make eye contact with anyone.</p>"
      ],
      [
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.1\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Just try not to make too much eye contact with anyone,&quot; Cody says. &quot;They already think you do dress-up from the color your eyes are.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.2\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But how could they? Are there any other races here?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.3\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Just humans,&quot; Cody says. &quot;So boring and dissimilar we call different skin colors different races, can you believe that?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.4\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I tell him, pushing the cart by its wheels instead of lifting it by the side.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.5\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The store is so flooded with people that it reminds me of my late childhood in the capital. But it seems that all the vendors are owned by the same people &mdash; the dog guy that Cody was talking about.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.6\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I spot three exits to the building in case anything happens, Cody tugs the cart past the massive screens, showcasing views of other worlds so real you can&apos;t even see the tiny little dots of color, and I begin to wonder whether it&apos;s a doorway like the one between our homes.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.7\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But Cody reads my mind. &quot;Not a portal,&quot; he says. &quot;Those are televisions.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.8\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Where do they go?&quot; I ask. &quot;I thought you had to project the pictures from a box.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.9\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Nowhere. You&apos;d probably get electrocuted if you stuck your head in there,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.10\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He goads me onward, passing an array of smaller screens in the telephone format that Cody has, called Smartphones, filled with so much knowledge it&apos;s like the Verdala and their network of wisdom trees.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.11\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I try not making eye contact, but it&apos;s unfathomable to see a crowd of people without a single cat-eared Ahkvasan or mixed-race person. And to think they all have no Essence at all: something that terrifies me if I imagine they were invaded.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I try to spin up some conversation instead of asking Cody foolish questions. &quot;Say, who is that girl that you admire?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Which one?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;The mug girl,&quot; I say. &quot;From work.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He laughs. &quot;Mug girl. You mean Kei?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah, Kei,&quot; I say. &quot;How are things with her?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;His grasp tightens around the mesh of the cart as I push it. &quot;I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m not really sure,&quot; he says. &quot;We used to be really close: we kissed, even. Things were getting good, then she left for college because she was a year ahead of me.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I ask, &quot;Did you have intercourse with this woman?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Cody convulses, grabbing my shoulder before he realizes we&apos;re alone in the aisle. He sighs. &quot;Katiya. You can&apos;t just talk about that out loud,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Why not?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Because people aren&apos;t always that open to talking about stuff like that.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Why should we care?&quot; I ask, sincerely.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.23\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Because it&apos;s etiquette. Sex, drugs, stuff like that, makes people uncomfortable, so it&apos;s better to talk in private.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Then how does anyone have . . . that level of engagement in your society?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s on the phone now,&quot; he whispers. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t just walk up to someone and ask for it, would you?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Well, in the poor parts of Northaven, when&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;&mdash;Don&apos;t answer that,&quot; he says, taking the cart over from me.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;So this girl,&quot; I start. &quot;The one you didn&apos;t have,&quot; and I almost laugh, &quot;business with.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He sneers at me. &quot;Yeah. We were too young for that, kind of. And then college was busy &mdash; sleeping around and stuff without anything real, and now the stupid, boring, lonely, real world you&apos;re thrust into after all that, when you have to pay off the student loan and become indebted to a piece of land.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But how could you ever be bored or lonely? Bored of this?&quot; She lifts a kids&apos; drawing kit, and then a card with a Nintendo Switch depicted on it. &quot;And how could you be lonely when you&apos;re literally connected to everyone?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Some passersby overhears her rant, and adds, &quot;You&apos;re goddamn right.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Then welcome to the modern age, and the biggest problem we&apos;ve created that we can&apos;t solve,&quot; I tell her, turning the corner of the last aisles on the first side of the store that get into the liquor. &quot;Be glad you&apos;re not included in it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But you don&apos;t have to do any of that.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.34\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Not when everybody else does,&quot; I muse. &quot;Imagine if everybody spoke a special language, and you decided not to learn it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.35\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Then they should speak the old language.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.36\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;The new language has funny pictures in it, though: or it used to be funny pictures. Now it&apos;s just pictures about depression.&quot; She narrows her eyes, without even the faintest thread of understanding to tug at. &quot;Hell, maybe you should just close the door and never come back.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.37\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But look at all this.&quot; She gestures to the rows and rows of produce. Whole chickens and hams wrapped in plastic. People filling their carts with an abundance. &quot;How the Res do your people make all this?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.38\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s all science,&quot; I say, grabbing a bagged salad that I&apos;ll buy to feel good about myself and probably forget in the back of the refrigerator. &quot;It&apos;s a world that&apos;s connected everywhere. Not a square inch of land uncharted, and we&apos;ve figured out exactly how to trade stuff with each other.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.39\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But what about wars and borders? No new land means it&apos;s a war for what&apos;s there, right?&quot; Katiya lifts a clear carton of cotton candy-flavored grapes.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.40\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Please. Just wait for your world to develop the last weapon it ever will: one that can wipe an entire city off a map. One with such power that it leaves the victims as no more than shaded shadows on the wall, giving the survivors illnesses that carry from generation to generation. Then give those weapons to everyone. And then you&apos;ll understand why we don&apos;t dispute those silly lines we shake hands over,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.41\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I realize I&apos;ve gone a little too far when we&apos;re deciding between colors of grapes. Her jaw hangs open. I get the variety pack so Katiya can take them home with her, and usher her to follow me on to the frozen meals section.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.42\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You seem to know a lot about war,&quot; she says. &quot;You seem strong for your world. Did you fight?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.43\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I say. &quot;But my brother did.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.44\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.45\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She hesitates to ask the next question, so I answer for her when we step into the large dairy fridge, feeling the same cold he must have felt when he had the bloody holes in his abdomen. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.46\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But he never came back.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.47\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.48\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I just think that&mdash;&quot; war is, but I stop myself, unwilling to go that far this soon.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.49\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Katiya fills the space with her own words. &quot;It must have been hard.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.50\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s been hard. It was roughly five years ago. Inspired me to make something in college,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.51\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She looks down at her calloused hands, then traces the faint outline of a scar that spans from her eye down her cheek.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.52\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I stop her before the pleasantries. &quot;I&apos;d rather not talk about it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.53\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She grasps the mesh of the cart as we walk down the frozen food aisle, maybe feeling again that I detest something about her.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.16.3.54\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But I need frozen stuff for work,&quot; I say, &quot;and maybe you can get something, too. Have you tried an eggwich?&quot;</p>"

Same rules: just don&apos;t make too much contact with anyone.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve fallen a long way since the intramural sports teams, sitting in a cube in an office all day,&quot; I say. &quot;Can&apos;t we just jog?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess. But I was really looking to push myself today.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Anything above a brisk walk is pushing it for me now,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;m not even close to your level. And I don&apos;t have Essence.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because you&apos;re just a weak little peasant, huh,&quot; she mocks, flashing her golden eyes at me with a smug grin. &quot;Relying on your big machines, because you let your bodies become so weak.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because we&apos;re trying to live longer than forty-five,&quot; I say. &quot;But &mdash; well, I guess you have a point with running.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Our people can live past a hundred and fifty if they have enough Essence. The Mask of the old Northaven royalty is pushing a hundred and sixty, I think &mdash; Ullrich, and he looks no older than my mother,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Good for you, then. Let&apos;s just get this over with,&quot; I tell her, lacing up the trainers I&apos;ve kept loose for years so that I can slide my feet into them.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s only when I see Katiya in her last-century running gear that I notice the fabric she wrapped her bra straps in around her shoulders, and the deep lines of crimson dug in from every single run.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So you haven&apos;t invented that yet, huh?&quot; I mutter.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Apparently we haven&apos;t invented a lot of things,&quot; she says, scratching the deep line worn into her shoulders. &quot;What is it now?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hold on,&quot; I tell her, returning to my world: stabilizing myself as my mind catches up with the temporal shift, sprinting up the stairs to tear through my dresser for the gym drawer. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Are you skipping out on me, you pushover?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;First drawer? No . . . second drawer? Nope . . . and third? I find the tight surf shirt I bought freshman year when I thought I&apos;d have time to ever enjoy the beach: tearing the tag off as I race back down the stairs.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Where did you go?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Something that might help you,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I have enough hand-me-down boy clothes from the Guard. What makes you think&mdash;&quot; but then her fingers touch the fabric. &quot;Oh,&quot; she says. &quot;Oh. That&apos;s really nice. I see what . . . can you leave for a minute?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I race back across the threshold. She finagles with the unfamiliar shirt material for about a minute before she says I can come in.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;I crack a smile when I see her wearing the bra over the white surf shirt. I start laughing at her.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot; She asks. &quot;Do I look too much like I&apos;m from your world?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I have to interject between laughs when she wears the upper-body equivalent of socks with sandals. &quot;You look like you belong nowhere! Bra over the shirt? The shirt is the whole point, you fool,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;She fumes as she removes the bra, holding her other shirt in her right hand. &quot;There. Better now, huh?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Should be better for you,&quot; I say, wiping a tear from my eyes as I catch a glimpse of the BILLABONG logo stretched out where my chest might loosely brush against it. And two bumps from the cool mountain air flowing through the back window.</p><p>&emsp;She traces the path of my eyes before I can remove them, and when she realizes what&apos;s got me flustered, she flips the bottom of the shirt up to double-pad her breast, exposing the toned definition in her abs.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You degenerate! Tricking a woman into exposing herself like that?&quot; She reaches for the knife block on the counter again.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, please, I insist! It&apos;s common fashion in my world.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Women walking around in their underwear? How gods-damn indecent!&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She grabs the knife that almost pinned me to the wall, taking aim as I cower beneath the kitchen table, considering whether to flip it again. And then I realize her world hasn&apos;t had flappers or half the women&apos;s progress I&apos;ve taken for granted.</p><p>&emsp;I say, &quot;I swear. Look: I considered taking you shopping for some clothes before I realized how weird that might be.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I have a boyfriend,&quot; she says: one line that seems to survive in any universe.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know.&quot; One that doesn&apos;t run with you anymore.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And you&apos;re not helping with our last rule,&quot; she insists. &quot;You remember?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re right,&quot; I say: my resentment outpacing that stupid part of my mind that will surely hold on to that image.</p><p>&emsp;She puts her mid-sleeve shirt on over the makeshift sports bra. &quot;Well, let&apos;s just get moving.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; I tell her, pushing down the feeling as the fear of her outside world overtakes me.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;He never overtakes me, now that I feel so efficient. Without the weight of my chest digging deeper trenches in the flesh of my shoulders, I feel so much lighter: my mind freed enough to take in the sights instead of staving off the thought of suffering.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s morning just like it is in Cody&apos;s world, but the air feels fresher: not saturated with the smell of gas and engines like the capital. Sometimes I wonder if Cody&apos;s world traded the splendor of nature for every other sensation that overstimulates the senses: the taste of meaty crunch shells; the smell tag that hangs from the front mirror of his automobile; the can of meadow-scented musk he sprays around the room when he thinks I&apos;m not looking, to mask the odor of his messes. </p><p>&emsp;And in that absence, I think he&apos;s begun to enjoy this world, even though it first terrified him. He huffs behind me in desperate gasps of breath, pleading every quarter-pass around the bottom of Lake Gaffesend to take a break, pretending it&apos;s because he wants to take in the view.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s incredible,&quot; he says, drenched in sweat that saturates an oversized shirt of mine in an upside-down triangle. &quot;This whole area looks like a natural park. Takes three hours of driving to get anywhere like this in Colorado. I&apos;d dream of living here for leisure!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The words sound so ignorant and pathetic when we&apos;re halfway between Gaffesend and the place my life changed forever. &quot;Leisure,&quot; I repeat.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. My world would have houses all along the shores, with docks and boathouses.&quot; He gestures along the distant northern edge where bodies washed ashore last week. &quot;Families floating in the middle of the lake on pontoon boats. With a meal or something, listening to Jack Johnson and&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Every description he tacks on makes my skin crawl. I feel an anger build that I can only remove with pain, with more running. Maybe it was a mistake bringing out an innocent, yellow-bellied civilian that hasn&apos;t seen the slightest sliver of war and what it causes. Like my pathetic father that was so damn soft his bones crunched beneath that scalding beam that&mdash;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya? Hey, what&apos;s wrong?&quot; Cody asks. My nails bite the flesh of my palms and I can feel my face running hot with my muscles tensed. &quot;Did I upset you? Or did I take too long a break?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Your whole life is a fucking break, I want to say, and I feel my jealousy ride on the threshold of that first rule we wrote together. But I see the earnestness in his expression&mdash; a feeling nobody in my world has the space for &mdash; and it refreshes me, somehow.</p><p>&emsp;I untension my expression. &quot;It&apos;s just that . . . our world has no room for talk like that. We don&apos;t talk in wishes. We only talk about what&apos;s real, and what might be coming.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He purses his lips, tracing an arc of dirt with his toe as he hesitates to look up at me. Seems as if he debates whether to speak his mind on that. &quot;I think that&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya?&quot; Another voice says. &quot;Is that you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;A rush of panic floods my circuits before I can reconcile his name. I glare at Cody, gesturing for him to find somewhere to hide &mdash; though when I turn around to face him, I find someone else shamelessly walking next to him.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian walks with Oriya and several of his friends. He tries to bury some sense of shame that threatens to take over, so he hides it with another string of words. &quot;What are you doing out here? Communing with the bushes?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m going for the run we were supposed to go on,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Supposed to?&quot; He asks. &quot;We agreed to go on two runs every week. And not at week&apos;s end.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But we didn&apos;t even go this week,&quot; I tell him, and noticing how the heat rises, his friends walk ahead. &quot;I thought you said you wanted to spend more time together.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I was going to tell you,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;But you never go on patrol, staying in the town. So it feels like you hardly want to spend time with me, and I&apos;m trying to do the quests that feel like they actually prepare me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My eyes dart between the trail and the underbrush where Cody hides. While Jullian makes his case for ignorance, Cody&apos;s expression cycles between disbelief and anger on my behalf, but I shake my head at him, insisting we keep our worlds separate.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian notices my lapse in attention. &quot;No, what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just . . . don&apos;t buy it,&quot; I say. &quot;If you really cared about us, about all those years we spent together fighting for a chance at this side of the warfront &mdash; if you really cherished what we built together, you would make an effort. Even the smallest thing!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I did make an effort,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;We spent the entire end of last week together!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That was about an hour. And it was before you insisted on meeting your friends at the bar!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I asked for you to come. And just like the celebration all those weeks ago, you refused to even try meeting other people in the Guard.&quot; He looks around to make sure no one else is around. &quot;Look. I didn&apos;t want to bring this up, but I get it if you&apos;re humiliated about what happened. The other guards have been talking, but I&apos;ve been standing up for you,&quot; he says. &quot;Every chance I get. And it&apos;s exhausting.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What I wanted was for you to stand with me. How can we stay close if all you ever do is support me from a distance? I needed you that night. Why didn&apos;t you even come check on me? Why did you choose your friends over me again?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because . . . it&apos;s just a lot, you know. You have this brilliant energy about you. The reason I love you. But ever since we came to Gaffesend, it feels like you&apos;ve changed. So much fuller of these plagues of anxiety and panic, and&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Are you coming or not, Jullian?&quot; one of his friends says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just a minute,&quot; he shouts, before turning to me again. &quot;And I&apos;m trying to calm down. To get us to calm down, because we&apos;ve made it here, and we have no reason to be so afraid.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What does that have anything to do with being there for me?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because I&apos;m tired, Katiya. And&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody makes a motion with the zipper on his trousers and cuts across the brush behind Jullian, giving him a start. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;God abo&mdash; I mean, Gods above, I&apos;m glad we stopped for a minute,&quot; he says, stretching his legs a couple times as my boyfriend turns to confront my housemate. Even though Jullian might be taller and fully Essenced, he looks like a beanpole compared to Cody. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Who the res are you?&quot; Jullian asks. Then the strangest sense of recognition overtakes him. &quot;Oh. You&apos;re that strange scientist from the Royal Academy! With the glowing square.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yep,&quot; Cody says. &quot;No idea what this disagreement is about. But your friend was getting upset about all the missed runs, and needed a running partner. So I filled in.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s my girlfriend,&quot; he says. A certain calculus plays in his head, shrivelling his face in a sneer as his mind re-runs the social arithmetic. &quot;And you live close by?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. We&apos;re next door-neighbors. The Royal Academy put me here in the military district. Since the houses are already sanctioned for the fighting types, and it&apos;s not always a full class that rolls through every time, they had a couple units left over.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Jullian&apos;s eyes flash between the two of us, and to his friends slowly vanishing down the path. I watch a certain confidence change inside of him.</p><p>&emsp;Cody laughs. &quot;She&apos;s really your girlfriend? I swear, I never see you over there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because I&apos;ve been busy,&quot; he insists.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, don&apos;t get too busy, then,&quot; Cody says. Your girl is beautiful. And if you don&apos;t spend enough time with her, she might just run away.&quot; Cody&apos;s eyes narrow with a humored smile. &quot;With someone else.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Jullian! Come on. It&apos;s gonna be dark before we get back,&quot; his friends shout.</p><p>&emsp;Cody says, &quot;You&apos;re already in the clothes for it. Wanna finish this run with us and ditch your friends? I have some . . . designing stuff . . . to do after this, so I can&apos;t stick around.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Jullian hesitates. His eyes meet mine as he squirms between choices, but after a while, it seems the guilt isn&apos;t strong enough. &quot;I already have plans. But let&apos;s go tomorrow. How about I stay over tonight?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And stay?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. And we&apos;ll go tomorrow,&quot; Jullian says, starting to run in the opposite direction to catch up with the other cadets.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You sure?&quot; Cody asks, but Jullian&apos;s already running away. He turns to me, squinting his eyes with a smug grin. &quot;I can see why you like him so much.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And why&apos;s that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He runs even more than you do,&quot; Cody says. &quot;You found the only man whose mental gymnastics can outpace your neurotic level of fitness.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, shut up,&quot; I tell him. But instead of finding a vacant space inside my chest, I find it filled with something else. </p><p>&emsp;A sense of reassurance.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What a loser,&quot; Cody says. &quot;So many guys I&apos;ve met in my life like him: especially back in college. Do you really have no other options? In my world, you&apos;d never pay for a drink in your life!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I think of all my female friends from the capital that settled in with children at a young age. Their softness and tenderness. And the way the other men we went out with would look at me: no more than a friend; as almost another guy; unsightly with all the scars from my past. &quot;Not ever in this world,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then this world sucks,&quot; Cody says. &quot;You&apos;re hot.&quot; Then adds, &quot;But it&apos;s too bad I don&apos;t fall for people that stab me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But this world is all I have,&quot; I tell him. &quot;And your world is all you have. And Jullian really loves me. We got each other through training, watched each other&apos;s sibllings, supported each other enough to make it here, we did everything together!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But people can change. And now he&apos;s a small fish in a much bigger lake.&quot; He stretches his legs as he digs his heels into the dirt, preparing to make it back without a break.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But he&apos;s all I have,&quot; I say, and I mean it. The volume of all those cherished memories is too heavy to ever tip the scales.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;If you say so,&quot; Cody says.</p><p>&emsp;We begin jogging back. I run at practically a walk so Cody has enough breath to speak in fuller sentences.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But thank you,&quot; I interject. &quot;Really, though. For standing up for me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He just needs to realize. How much you&apos;re worth, Katiya,&quot; Cody says. &quot;If you really insist, on this guy, then . . . you&apos;ve gotta, shake him out of it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he huffs. &quot;So. Are there . . . any other friends . . . I can meet?&quot;</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re the science fella,&quot; Paxton says, taking a deep swig from the mug in our favorite spot in front of the window. &quot;So you&apos;re here for a while, huh?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The Royal Academy sent me here for a while,&quot; Cody lies, reciting the story we rehearsed on the tail end of the run. He crushes the ale almost as fast as Ryder and Pax do, because he was in some alcohol training program in college &mdash; at least from how he explained it to me.</p><p>&emsp;I managed to gather all of us at the front of the bar: Aldrin wasn&apos;t lying when he said drinking is all you really had to do when the week ends. Cae wets her tongue with a glass of water on the end, too nervous to talk. Bertram, Ryder, and Pax crowd around the middle seat where Cody tries to remember all the important details.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The device you showed us that night was really interesting,&quot; Ryder says. &quot;How did you make it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Some new non-Essenced technology that runs on electricity,&quot; Cody says. &quot;Who says you&apos;re always going to have access to Essence?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So it&apos;s for the people, then? Guards are always brimming with Essence,&quot; Bertram says. &quot;But I can see how that would be useful for the civilians.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody swirls the mug around, probably wondering why I stick to water like the Ahkvasan. &quot;Yeah.&quot; He turns to Cae. &quot;So. You&apos;re actually part cat?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My other friends are taken aback by his sudden outburst.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Where the Res are you from?&quot; Bertram asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You can&apos;t just say that,&quot; Pax insists, as Cody disappears behind his mug. &quot;Even to half-bloods.&quot; He turns to me. &quot;Where did you say he was from again?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh . . .&quot; I try to think of the most remote place I can think of. &quot;From Blackwater?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m from Blackwater!&quot; Ryder exclaims.</p><p>&emsp;Fuck.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What part of the city did you live in?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh . . . north?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No way,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s where I was from. How did you make it out?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody glares at me for help, but not even I know anything about Blackwater. He defaults to the basics. &quot;With my, uh, technology.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Did you develop for the Academy? How the Res did you survive the frosthards? Not even this snowdrifter kid I knew growing up, er . . . my brother&apos;s friend . . . could stay out there for more than a couple days.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t think he really wants to talk about it,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;Cody looks relieved as he finishes the last swig.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I get it,&quot; Ryder says. &quot;I gave up a lot getting away from that frostbitten prison.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Our group fills the silence with a few sips. But Cae surprises us when she speaks up.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, not a lot of Humans up here have seen the Ahkvasa,&quot; she says. &quot;Only fire-blooded people survive up here. Our race lives in the jungles. Far from the cold.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So what can you do?&quot; Cody asks.</p><p>&emsp;She raises the water glass that&apos;s empty besides a few drips, turning it over in the air, allowing the last drip of water to exit the rim of the glass. </p><p>&emsp;Then she focuses. </p><p>&emsp;The drip decelerates to a slow crawl as it floats through the air. and the harder she squints her jade eyes, the slower it travels, until it almost reaches a halt.</p><p>&emsp;Cody&apos;s jaw drops as she relinquishes her control, allowing the drop to splatter against the table. &quot;You can float things?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Float?&quot; Cae laughs: a rare sight, probably thinking he&apos;s even more ignorant than Pax. But it&apos;s refreshing to re-experience the most mundane aspects of the world through a new set of eyes. &quot;Time dilation.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Time travel?&quot; Cody asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; Cae says. &quot;You can&apos;t go back, only slow things down. This world doesn&apos;t have time travel. Unless, maybe, if you&apos;re a Mask or something.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh. In my world&mdash;&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I slap my hand against his chest. </p><p>&emsp;He coughs. &quot;Excuse me. In my town, we called them furries. But they&apos;d wear these suits. Pretty impressive.&quot; He then realizes Ryder is present, glaring at him quizzically, and adds, &quot;but only in a small area, after this one incident where this guy, uh . . . nevermind.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You sure you&apos;re from Blackwater?&quot; Ryder asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe he&apos;s one of those weird rich types, dressed like that,&quot; Pax says.</p><p>&emsp;Cody digs himself further. &quot;Had to escape my family. They were crazy.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No kidding, damn Merlot. How they can lie to a whole people and keep their composure like that,&quot; Ryder says. He claps Cody on the back. &quot;Makes me respect you if you wisened up when you had it all like that. I like you, Cody. That must have been hard: harder than anything I&apos;ve ever been through.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody hangs his head. &quot;Thanks, bro.&quot; He takes a swig. &quot;So anyways, how do you all know Katiya?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody continues to interrogate each of my friends, and despite the odd force that transforms his language into mine, he speaks with such a charisma that they don&apos;t even realize all the questions he&apos;s asking.</p><p>&emsp;He manages to get their opinions of Jullian. He learns of my connection to Bertram, and how he saved me on the night of the fire. He even manages to develop a few in-jokes with them, calling Bertram &quot;Barry&quot; and coaxing Pax to do his frozen shotglass trick.</p><p>&emsp;By the time it&apos;s over, it&apos;s like he&apos;s &quot;one of the boys.&quot; And when the sun crosses the top of the window, casting its rays to signify midday has passed, we bid goodbye to them, asking again where Cody lives, to which he responds with a generic answer.</p><p>&emsp;We walk back in silence in our running clothes. I notice the absence of a pain that used to dig into my shoulders.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m exhausted,&quot; Cody says when we cross the entry door. &quot;I&apos;m good at acting like I&apos;m social, but my battery runs out fast.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You did well today,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You think they liked me?&quot; He asks, showing the last sliver of energy he&apos;s stored for our goodbye. &quot;Not that I care what they think. I&apos;ll probably never see them again.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;They liked you a lot,&quot; I say. &quot;Maybe they didn&apos;t buy every lie, but you gave them a good time.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He scratches the back of his head. &quot;Say. I know we made that rule to not get too invested in each other&apos;s lives, but how about we help each other out?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you have Jullian, and that childhood friend that likes you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Bertram?&quot; I ask. &quot;Not a chance. We&apos;re like siblings with how we grew up.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How cliche,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nothing. But if I help you with Jullian and your denial of feelings for the other guy, how about you help me with mine?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask for a second time.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I got this girl I&apos;ve liked for a while,&quot; Cody says. &quot;The one we talked about at Costco. And you&apos;re a girl. Maybe we could help each other out.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It would keep us in our worlds,&quot; I say. &quot;Not longing to cross this door and live on the other side forever.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Exactly. Because we sure as hell aren&apos;t getting together,&quot; Cody says. &quot;I&apos;ll keep Jullian on his toes. And you help me with Kei. Because if we&apos;re forced to share the same space, we might as well help each other.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I think that will work just fine,&quot; I say.</p>"

        "<p id=\"2.17.1.11\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Because you&apos;re just a weak little peasant, huh,&quot; she mocks, flashing her golden eyes at me with a smug grin. &quot;Relying on your big machines, because you let your bodies become so weak.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Because we&apos;re trying to live longer than forty-five,&quot; I say. &quot;But &mdash; well, I guess you have a point with running.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Our people can live past a hundred and fifty if they have enough Essence. The Mask of the old Northaven royalty is pushing a hundred and sixty, I think &mdash; Ullrich, and he looks no older than my mother,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Good for you, then. Let&apos;s just get this over with,&quot; I tell her, lacing up the trainers I&apos;ve kept loose for years so that I can slide my feet into them.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;It&apos;s only when I see Katiya in her last-century running gear that I notice the fabric she wrapped her bra straps in around her shoulders, and the deep lines of crimson dug in from every single run.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;So you haven&apos;t invented that yet, huh?&quot; I mutter.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Apparently we haven&apos;t invented a lot of things,&quot; she says, scratching the deep line worn into her shoulders. &quot;What is it now?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Hold on,&quot; I tell her, returning to my world: stabilizing myself as my mind catches up with the temporal shift, sprinting up the stairs to tear through my dresser for the gym drawer. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Are you skipping out on me, you pushover?&quot; She asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;First drawer? No . . . second drawer? Nope . . . and third? I find the tight surf shirt I bought freshman year when I thought I&apos;d have time to ever enjoy the beach: tearing the tag off as I race back down the stairs.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Where did you go?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Something that might help you,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.23\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I have enough hand-me-down boy clothes from the Guard. What makes you think&mdash;&quot; but then her fingers touch the fabric. &quot;Oh,&quot; she says. &quot;Oh. That&apos;s really nice. I see what . . . can you leave for a minute?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I race back across the threshold. She finagles with the unfamiliar shirt material for about a minute before she says I can come in.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Well?&quot; She asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I crack a smile when I see her wearing the bra over the white surf shirt. I start laughing at her.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;What?&quot; She asks. &quot;Do I look too much like I&apos;m from your world?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I have to interject between laughs when she wears the upper-body equivalent of socks with sandals. &quot;You look like you belong nowhere! Bra over the shirt? The shirt is the whole point, you fool,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She fumes as she removes the bra, holding her other shirt in her right hand. &quot;There. Better now, huh?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Should be better for you,&quot; I say, wiping a tear from my eyes as I catch a glimpse of the BILLABONG logo stretched out where my chest might loosely brush against it. And two bumps from the cool mountain air flowing through the back window.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She traces the path of my eyes before I can remove them, and when she realizes what&apos;s got me flustered, she flips the bottom of the shirt up to double-pad her breast, exposing the toned definition in her abs.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You degenerate! Tricking a woman into exposing herself like that?&quot; She reaches for the knife block on the counter again.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No, please, I insist! It&apos;s common fashion in my world.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.17.1.35\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She grabs the knife that almost pinned me to the wall, taking aim as I cower beneath the kitchen table, considering whether to flip it again. And then I realize her world hasn&apos;t had flappers or half the women&apos;s progress I&apos;ve taken for granted.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.36\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I say, &quot;I swear. Look: I considered taking you shopping for some clothes before I realized how weird that might be.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.17.1.39\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;And you&apos;re not helping with our last rule,&quot; she insists. &quot;You remember?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.40\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re right,&quot; I say: my resentment outpacing that stupid part of my mind that will surely hold on to that image.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.41\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She puts her mid-sleeve shirt on over the makeshift sports bra. &quot;Well, let&apos;s just get moving.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.1.42\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; I tell her, pushing down the feeling as the fear of her outside world overtakes me.</p>"

        "<p id=\"2.17.2.1\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He never overtakes me, now that I feel so efficient. Without the weight of my chest digging deeper trenches in the flesh of my shoulders, I feel so much lighter: my mind freed enough to take in the sights instead of staving off the thought of suffering.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.2\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;It&apos;s morning just like it is in Cody&apos;s world, but the air feels fresher: not saturated with the smell of gas and engines like the capital. Sometimes I wonder if Cody&apos;s world traded the splendor of nature for every other sensation that overstimulates the senses: the taste of meaty crunch shells; the smell tag that hangs from the front mirror of his automobile; the can of meadow-scented musk he sprays around the room when he thinks I&apos;m not looking, to mask the odor of his messes. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.3\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;And in that absence, I think he&apos;s begun to enjoy this world, even though it first terrified him. He huffs behind me in desperate gasps of breath, pleading every quarter-pass around the bottom of Lake Gaffesend to take a break, pretending it&apos;s because he wants to take in the view.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.4\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s incredible,&quot; he says, drenched in sweat that saturates an oversized shirt of mine in an upside-down triangle. &quot;This whole area looks like a natural park. Takes three hours of driving to get anywhere like this in Colorado. I&apos;d dream of living here for leisure!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.5\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The words sound so ignorant and pathetic when we&apos;re halfway between Gaffesend and the place my life changed forever. &quot;Leisure,&quot; I repeat.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.6\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah. My world would have houses all along the shores, with docks and boathouses.&quot; He gestures along the distant northern edge where bodies washed ashore last week. &quot;Families floating in the middle of the lake on pontoon boats. With a meal or something, listening to Jack Johnson and&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.7\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Every description he tacks on makes my skin crawl. I feel an anger build that I can only remove with pain, with more running. Maybe it was a mistake bringing out an innocent, yellow-bellied civilian that hasn&apos;t seen the slightest sliver of war and what it causes. Like my pathetic father that was so damn soft his bones crunched beneath that scalding beam that&mdash;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.8\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Katiya? Hey, what&apos;s wrong?&quot; Cody asks. My nails bite the flesh of my palms and I can feel my face running hot with my muscles tensed. &quot;Did I upset you? Or did I take too long a break?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.9\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Your whole life is a fucking break, I want to say, and I feel my jealousy ride on the threshold of that first rule we wrote together.

        "<p id=\"2.17.2.10\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I untension my expression. &quot;It&apos;s just that . . . our world has no room for talk like that. We don&apos;t talk in wishes. We only talk about what&apos;s real, and what might be coming.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.11\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He purses his lips, tracing an arc of dirt with his toe as he hesitates to look up at me. Seems as if he debates whether to speak his mind on that. &quot;I think that&mdash;&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.17.2.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Jullian walks with Oriya and several of his friends. He tries to bury some sense of shame that threatens to take over, so he hides it with another string of words. &quot;What are you doing out here? Communing with the bushes?&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.17.2.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But we didn&apos;t even go this week,&quot; I tell him, and noticing how the heat rises, his friends walk ahead. &quot;I thought you said you wanted to spend more time together.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I was going to tell you,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;But you never go on patrol, staying in the town. So it feels like you hardly want to spend time with me, and I&apos;m trying to do the quests that feel like they actually prepare me.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My eyes dart between the trail and the underbrush where Cody hides. While Jullian makes his case for ignorance, Cody&apos;s expression cycles between disbelief and anger on my behalf, but I shake my head at him, insisting we keep our worlds separate.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.17.2.21\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I just . . . don&apos;t buy it,&quot; I say. &quot;If you really cared about us, about all those years we spent together fighting for a chance at this side of the warfront &mdash; if you really cherished what we built together, you would make an effort. Even the smallest thing!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.22\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I did make an effort,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;We spent the entire end of last week together!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.23\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;That was about an hour. And it was before you insisted on meeting your friends at the bar!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I asked for you to come. And just like the celebration all those weeks ago, you refused to even try meeting other people in the Guard.&quot; He looks around to make sure no one else is around. &quot;Look. I didn&apos;t want to bring this up, but I get it if you&apos;re humiliated about what happened. The other guards have been talking, but I&apos;ve been standing up for you,&quot; he says. &quot;Every chance I get. And it&apos;s exhausting.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What I wanted was for you to stand with me. How can we stay close if all you ever do is support me from a distance? I needed you that night.

        "<p id=\"2.17.2.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Because . . . it&apos;s just a lot, you know. You have this brilliant energy about you. The reason I love you.

        "<p id=\"2.17.2.29\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What does that have anything to do with being there for me?&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.17.2.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Cody makes a motion with the zipper on his trousers and cuts across the brush behind Jullian, giving him a start. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.32\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;God abo&mdash; I mean, Gods above, I&apos;m glad we stopped for a minute,&quot; he says, stretching his legs a couple times as my boyfriend turns to confront my housemate. Even though Jullian might be taller and fully Essenced, he looks like a beanpole compared to Cody. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.33\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Who the res are you?&quot; Jullian asks. Then the strangest sense of recognition overtakes him. &quot;Oh. You&apos;re that strange scientist from the Royal Academy! With the glowing square.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.34\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Yep,&quot; Cody says. &quot;No idea what this disagreement is about. But your friend was getting upset about all the missed runs, and needed a running partner. So I filled in.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.35\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s my girlfriend,&quot; he says. A certain calculus plays in his head, shrivelling his face in a sneer as his mind re-runs the social arithmetic. &quot;And you live close by?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.36\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah. We&apos;re next door-neighbors. The Royal Academy put me here in the military district. Since the houses are already sanctioned for the fighting types, and it&apos;s not always a full class that rolls through every time, they had a couple units left over.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.37\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Jullian&apos;s eyes flash between the two of us, and to his friends slowly vanishing down the path. I watch a certain confidence change inside of him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.38\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Cody laughs. &quot;She&apos;s really your girlfriend? I swear, I never see you over there.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.39\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Because I&apos;ve been busy,&quot; he insists.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.40\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Well, don&apos;t get too busy, then,&quot; Cody says. Your girl is beautiful. And if you don&apos;t spend enough time with her, she might just run away.&quot; Cody&apos;s eyes narrow with a humored smile. &quot;With someone else.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.41\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Jullian! Come on. It&apos;s gonna be dark before we get back,&quot; his friends shout.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.42\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Cody says, &quot;You&apos;re already in the clothes for it. Wanna finish this run with us and ditch your friends? I have some . . . designing stuff . . . to do after this, so I can&apos;t stick around.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.43\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Jullian hesitates. His eyes meet mine as he squirms between choices, but after a while, it seems the guilt isn&apos;t strong enough. &quot;I already have plans. But let&apos;s go tomorrow. How about I stay over tonight?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.44\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And stay?&quot; I ask.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.17.2.46\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You sure?&quot; Cody asks, but Jullian&apos;s already running away. He turns to me, squinting his eyes with a smug grin. &quot;I can see why you like him so much.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.47\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And why&apos;s that?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.48\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;He runs even more than you do,&quot; Cody says. &quot;You found the only man whose mental gymnastics can outpace your neurotic level of fitness.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.2.49\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Oh, shut up,&quot; I tell him. But instead of finding a vacant space inside my chest, I find it filled with something else. </p>",

        "<p id=\"2.17.2.52\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I think of all my female friends from the capital that settled in with children at a young age. Their softness and tenderness.

        "<p id=\"2.17.3.11\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Uh . . .&quot; I try to think of the most remote place I can think of. &quot;From Blackwater?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.12\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m from Blackwater!&quot; Ryder exclaims.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.13\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Fuck.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What part of the city did you live in?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Uh . . . north?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;No way,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s where I was from. How did you make it out?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Cody glares at me for help, but not even I know anything about Blackwater. He defaults to the basics. &quot;With my, uh, technology.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Did you develop for the Academy? How the Res did you survive the frosthards? Not even this snowdrifter kid I knew growing up, er . . . my brother&apos;s friend . . . could stay out there for more than a couple days.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t think he really wants to talk about it,&quot; I say. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Cody looks relieved as he finishes the last swig.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.21\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I get it,&quot; Ryder says. &quot;I gave up a lot getting away from that frostbitten prison.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.22\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Our group fills the silence with a few sips. But Cae surprises us when she speaks up.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.23\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Well, not a lot of Humans up here have seen the Ahkvasa,&quot; she says. &quot;Only fire-blooded people survive up here. Our race lives in the jungles. Far from the cold.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;So what can you do?&quot; Cody asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;She raises the water glass that&apos;s empty besides a few drips, turning it over in the air, allowing the last drip of water to exit the rim of the glass. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Then she focuses. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.27\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The drip decelerates to a slow crawl as it floats through the air. and the harder she squints her jade eyes, the slower it travels, until it almost reaches a halt.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.28\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Cody&apos;s jaw drops as she relinquishes her control, allowing the drop to splatter against the table. &quot;You can float things?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.29\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Float?&quot; Cae laughs: a rare sight, probably thinking he&apos;s even more ignorant than Pax. But it&apos;s refreshing to re-experience the most mundane aspects of the world through a new set of eyes. &quot;Time dilation.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.30\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Time travel?&quot; Cody asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; Cae says. &quot;You can&apos;t go back, only slow things down. This world doesn&apos;t have time travel. Unless, maybe, if you&apos;re a Mask or something.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.32\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Huh. In my world&mdash;&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.33\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I slap my hand against his chest. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.34\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He coughs. &quot;Excuse me. In my town, we called them furries. But they&apos;d wear these suits. Pretty impressive.&quot; He then realizes Ryder is present, glaring at him quizzically, and adds, &quot;but only in a small area, after this one incident where this guy, uh . . . nevermind.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.35\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You sure you&apos;re from Blackwater?&quot; Ryder asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.36\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Maybe he&apos;s one of those weird rich types, dressed like that,&quot; Pax says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.37\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Cody digs himself further. &quot;Had to escape my family. They were crazy.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.38\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;No kidding, damn Merlot. How they can lie to a whole people and keep their composure like that,&quot; Ryder says. He claps Cody on the back. &quot;Makes me respect you if you wisened up when you had it all like that. I like you, Cody. That must have been hard: harder than anything I&apos;ve ever been through.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.39\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Cody hangs his head. &quot;Thanks, bro.&quot; He takes a swig. &quot;So anyways, how do you all know Katiya?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.40\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Cody continues to interrogate each of my friends, and despite the odd force that transforms his language into mine, he speaks with such a charisma that they don&apos;t even realize all the questions he&apos;s asking.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.41\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He manages to get their opinions of Jullian. He learns of my connection to Bertram, and how he saved me on the night of the fire. He even manages to develop a few in-jokes with them, calling Bertram &quot;Barry&quot; and coaxing Pax to do his frozen shotglass trick.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.42\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;By the time it&apos;s over, it&apos;s like he&apos;s &quot;one of the boys.&quot; And when the sun crosses the top of the window, casting its rays to signify midday has passed, we bid goodbye to them, asking again where Cody lives, to which he responds with a generic answer.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.43\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We walk back in silence in our running clothes. I notice the absence of a pain that used to dig into my shoulders.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.44\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m exhausted,&quot; Cody says when we cross the entry door. &quot;I&apos;m good at acting like I&apos;m social, but my battery runs out fast.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.45\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You did well today,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.46\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You think they liked me?&quot; He asks, showing the last sliver of energy he&apos;s stored for our goodbye. &quot;Not that I care what they think. I&apos;ll probably never see them again.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.47\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;They liked you a lot,&quot; I say. &quot;Maybe they didn&apos;t buy every lie, but you gave them a good time.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.48\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He scratches the back of his head. &quot;Say. I know we made that rule to not get too invested in each other&apos;s lives, but how about we help each other out?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.49\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.50\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Well, you have Jullian, and that childhood friend that likes you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.51\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Bertram?&quot; I ask. &quot;Not a chance. We&apos;re like siblings with how we grew up.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.52\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;How cliche,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.53\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.54\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Nothing. But if I help you with Jullian and your denial of feelings for the other guy, how about you help me with mine?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.55\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask for a second time.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.56\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I got this girl I&apos;ve liked for a while,&quot; Cody says. &quot;The one we talked about at Costco. And you&apos;re a girl. Maybe we could help each other out.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.57\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;It would keep us in our worlds,&quot; I say. &quot;Not longing to cross this door and live on the other side forever.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.58\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Exactly. Because we sure as hell aren&apos;t getting together,&quot; Cody says. &quot;I&apos;ll keep Jullian on his toes. And you help me with Kei. Because if we&apos;re forced to share the same space, we might as well help each other.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.17.3.59\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I think that will work just fine,&quot; I say.</p>"

      "<p>&emsp;&quot;I think that will work just fine,&quot; Reed says. &quot;What do you think?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;But he&apos;s not talking to me. He&apos;s approached almost every engineer in the office to ask their opinion about his design choices, and now he&apos;s back there with Wilbur, preventing him from dozing back off into his &quot;wake apnea&quot;.</p><p>&emsp;I scratch away at the yellow engineering pad, sketching my own ideas instead of relying on others all the damn time. It&apos;s easy to draw in 3D when it&apos;s just a plate with a few holes in it: far different from the radical ideas my adversary is coming up with.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s up with all the rounds?&quot; Wilbur asks. &quot;It costs a lot of money to ask the machinist to clean up every edge like that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh. I never thought about that,&quot; Reed says.</p><p>&emsp;Because he&apos;s never been in a machine shop, I think to myself.</p><p>&emsp;Wilbur rambles for another thirty minutes about the history of drafting. Reed eagerly nods his head, and I think it&apos;s beyond the level where he&apos;s just listening until he can escape. All the while, I consider the different ways I can design the enclosure, sketching several different designs between scrolls through social media to keep up on the people I used to know.</p><p>&emsp;He pops up like a jump-scare when I have my head down, trying to skip an ad about a freemium game. &quot;What have you come up with so far?&quot; Reed asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not much, really.&quot; He should probably learn on his own that designing for aesthetics gets you shot down harder than a Russian jet over American airspace. &quot;Mostly just figuring out how to enclose the thing.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; he says. He turns his new computer over to me, showing his model of parts that aren&apos;t put together yet. &quot;I&apos;m not very good at assembling things yet with this new software.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Too familiar with SolidWorks?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How did you know?&quot; He asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Who isn&apos;t,&quot; I say. &quot;I hate this software. But I&apos;ve been forced to use it for so long I&apos;ve used it ten times as much as all the SolidWorks in undergrad.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re smart for a relatively new guy,&quot; Reed says, laying the compliments on thick like he does with damn near everyone. &quot;We&apos;ll be fast friends,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;Sure, I think.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; I say, amicably.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So what did you do over the weekend?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I talk like the other middle-aged men, minus the stuff about the yard I don&apos;t have. &quot;Not much, just went to Costco and went on a run.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We missed you at the work social,&quot; Reed says. &quot;Is it true you&apos;ve never been to one of them?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just get tired easy.&quot; And then I whisper, &quot;I get enough home improvement and little-league talk in the stand-up meetings.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Even Kei made it,&quot; Reed says. &quot;She said she tried to call you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I just wasn&apos;t feeling too great.&quot; I start sketching on the yellow pad to try to look busy enough to get him to leave.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well I hope I&apos;ll see you next time,&quot; Reed says. He exits to the floor, off to bother some underpaid union technicians with even more stuff they&apos;ll have to assemble. I continue sketching on the notepad, returning the headphones to my ears I bought after I lost Jackson&apos;s iPod Classic.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Quite the eager fella,&quot; Wilbur says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say. &quot;I guess it hasn&apos;t gotten to him yet.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I see him peek his head from the divider into the narrow alley: a balding Asian man with glasses and light wrinkles. &quot;Has it gotten to you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I say. The rusted wall fan makes enough noise that only Wilbur can hear my words, so I feel like I&apos;m able to speak openly. &quot;I think I just had a different idea of what engineering was. I liked designing things. But it was when something happened to me &mdash; or to someone in my family, I guess &mdash; that really made me chase it.&quot; I look at the 3D-printed mini model on my desk that I made to show my brother all those years ago. He was amazed by it: so similar to the tech he got to use in the military.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So I&apos;m guessing it wasn&apos;t batteries,&quot; he says, narrowing his eyes in a sagacious smile.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;More so flying things. But smaller. And not for people,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Drones,&quot; he says. And when he answers right, I hand him the little geometric prototype. &quot;This is really cool! When did you make this? And did you make a full-size one?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say. &quot;For Senior Design: after the incident, they let me pretty much be my own sponsor if I could fork the cash.&quot; I feel a rare sense of passion flood my body, and for a moment, I feel almost like Reed. &quot;I led the team to develop it: they let me take on some junior engineers at the school. And you see those gears?&quot; I point at a small pattern in the lines of PLA plastic.</p><p>&emsp; &quot;Yeah. Heck &mdash; if this is like 1:10 scale, those must have been really small,&quot; Wilbur says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Took us damn near a month to find a solution for that. Bevel gears? And that small, with a D-shaft that didn&apos;t fit any existing gears we could order?&quot; My chest runs with the excitement of those days as my tongue spouts off with jargon. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t believe what we had to do to make it work. Last month of a senior project we had a whole year for, and that was the last thing we had to resolve.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Gearbox design is fun,&quot; he muses. &quot;So how did you do it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Get this: one of the teammates&apos; moms knew another mom that ran a jewelry company. They did lost wax castings&mdash; you know, where they pour in the molten metal to take the shape of the wax?&quot; I pause, realizing I&apos;m talking to a lifer. &quot;No, I&apos;m stupid. Of course you know that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Wilbur laughs, egging me on.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Anyways, we got this jewelry company to make our gears. Arrived the last week: only a single shot to get them right. And they were perfect: each wrapped in an individually-wrapped vellum bag as if we&apos;d put them on stings and wear them around our neck,&quot; I say, out of breath with excitement, and when I realize the fan has been off for a while, I find Nav and Kei standing at the other end of the cube.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s really awesome, Cody,&quot; Naveen says. &quot;Why did you never tell us about that before?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And you didn&apos;t even tell the best part,&quot; Kei says.</p><p>&emsp;My face flushes with humiliation, always uncomfortable when I&apos;m the center of attention. &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I mutter, &quot;which part?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He won best in show for his year,&quot; Kei said.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, please,&quot; I beg. &quot;I had an uplifting story. And they have a reputation to uphold&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;And the president of the university took him on a little tour to speak on campus. The press got involved. And he got his story in the Los Angeles Times, can you believe that?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She points to the article that hangs on the wall of my cubicle:</p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>BROTHER OF FALLEN SOLDIER DESIGNS THE FUTURE</span></p><p>&emsp;Beneath the big font on the front page are two pictures: one of Jackson and I when we were kids, and a photo of me directing my team in a suit &mdash; that last hour of the project when we were rushing in full suits and dresses, wearing smocks over our formal clothes, spray-painting the prototype black.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. It was fun. And that&apos;s why I&apos;m here,&quot; I say. But the high from that memory leaves when reality returns: I freeze my face in the genuine smile I had a minute ago not to lose it, to insist redlines for battery enclosures shouldn&apos;t be any different.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I sure was proud of my boy,&quot; a voice says.</p><p>&emsp;I realize it&apos;s lunchtime. </p><p>&emsp;My father Alan, a technician, steps between Kei and Nav.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right. You told us a little about Cody before the interview,&quot; Nav says.</p><p>&emsp;Dad scratches his salt-and-pepper beard. &quot;Yeah. He used to build things with me in the garage. Now he just designs things on that computer, thinking that&apos;s the real world and all!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Alright, that&apos;s enough, Dad,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You didn&apos;t even finish my redline. The one with your name on the drawing? Those two damn 5/16-18 hex screws that are so close they can&apos;t fit a ratchet on them? I put a toolbox together for you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Alright,&quot; I repeat, grabbing my keys.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;Not that Harbor Freight shit. I&apos;m talking Snap-On, Gear Wrench, and you must not even touch that stuff if you&apos;re that blind to it!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The three engineers laugh as I rush to push my greasy father out the door.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;We&apos;re snaking down the switchbacks of Shaleborough Canyon when he decides to take another dig at me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen your car this clean.&quot; He drags one of his dirty fingers across the dashboard.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;ll only get dirtier if you get your greasy paws all over it,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Did a girl finally make it into your life? Sweet Jesus, I thought you&apos;d be stuck in that game room of yours playing the Nintendo forever,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe I did,&quot; I say. &quot;Or maybe some girl in my complex wanted to use me for my Costco card.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He sniffs and does a dad cough before offering some fatherly wisdom. &quot;You see, son, women are like raccoons. They&apos;ll tear through all the trash you have to offer until you give them something shiny that keeps their interest.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So Mom is a raccoon,&quot; I say, expecting him to relent.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, your mother had the deepest bags under her eyes when she was teaching in the Los Angeles school district. If a woman can handle a gaggle of rats that try to kill her every day, then you know she&apos;s tough enough to handle someone like me,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;He rambles on about living life at my age in the poor part of Los Angeles, and after a couple more turns, we pull into the only lot that gives us enough time to get him back on union time. He says some choice words about the people around him. Then the gossip from the floor, saying how the men he works with whine more than &quot;any of those housewife shows the stay-at-home moms watch.&quot; And by the time we walk in the door of the Wendy&apos;s, he&apos;s silent enough for us to order and sit in one of the plastic booths, wetting his hands with a bottle of Purell before wiping the sullied table with his dirtier work shirt.</p><p>&emsp;I glance at the play structure from the nineties that I used to play in, when my father drove down the canyon to meet the rest of our family, spending no longer than the time we have now to check in with us. He worked two shifts for the overtime, to give my brother and I enough to flourish with a full childhood, and when he catches me lost in that memory, he gestures to one of the structure&apos;s cross-bars zip-tied to a pool noodle.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You almost broke your nose on that damn thing,&quot; my father says. &quot;You remember?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, I remember,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Chasing Jackson down the slide. He ducked and I didn&apos;t see it, then I spouted so much damn blood&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like a fountain. And your mother was so panicked,&quot; he laughs, &quot;tearing a whole stack of napkins one-by-one out of the dispenser, while I was smart enough to ask the front for a whole roll of paper towels!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I chuckle. &quot;Those were times.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Good times?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Good enough to remember,&quot; I tell him, just as the tray arrives with our dollar-menu burgers.</p><p>&emsp;He picks the pickles out of one of his, then takes a deep bite before rubbing his mouth with a napkin. I bite into mine just as he opens his mouth to speak, halfway through a mouthful. &quot;You know I meant what I said back there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;About the redlines.&quot; I dip my fries in ketchup.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, doofus,&quot; he says, staring at me with piercing eyes like mine. &quot;About the project.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The drone,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot; He takes another bite, and hunger blocks his next thought for another thirty seconds or so. &quot;You made me so proud that day. I hope you still have that project.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I do,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Have you worked any further on it since you moved out? You have the tools now,&quot; he says. &quot;And now you know enough to really finish it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not sure it would even fly anymore,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;He shakes a fry at me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s a shame.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just had a lot of energy I had to put somewhere in a really short period of time. After the service at Fort Dietz. After I read that last letter, I had burning purpose, you know? If I didn&apos;t stop, I think that truth would break me entirely.&quot; I sink my teeth into the burger again, distracting myself enough with something savory to prevent the habit of those feelings from coming back.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We each had our own ways of dealing with it,&quot; my father says. &quot;You either channel that empty feeling or it snags you. Catching up in every little moment of those habits he shaped in us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;We closed his bedroom door for months, petrified the exact way he left it. And we were too afraid to open it, just saving that last experience of throwing open the door like the last voicemails on our phones.</p><p>&emsp;Because once the door was opened, he&apos;d remain nothing more than a memory, forever.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You reminded me a little of him today,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh yeah?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you&apos;re the age he was now. Your voices sound alike. And when I was done with that soyboy man-bun kid, ragging me over with questions about some stupid enclosure design&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I laugh. &quot;You mean Reed?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, whatever. But anyways, when I came up the metal stairs to the room with all the office pukes, I almost thought I heard your brother.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just never hear you passionate like that, son,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Redlines are shit.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you&apos;re not like any of them. Maybe besides that legacy hire friend of yours.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You really think?&quot; I pull down my eyelid after wiping the salt from my fingers, rolling my right eye into the back of my skull. &quot;Can you see it? Is there a soul still in there?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody, I mean it,&quot; he insists. &quot;I&apos;ve been working here for a long time, and I&apos;ve come to understand there&apos;s two types of engineers.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s the ones that do it for the money. The lifers: satisfied with slow work that never changes, with such tribal knowledge that they&apos;d take the whole company down with them if they died.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That sounds like me without the experience,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you&apos;re not,&quot; Dad says, shaking another fry at me. &quot;You have passion! You&apos;re going to design rockets one day. You&apos;re the dreaming type that wants more.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;All I dream of is not fucking up,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Type two in theory, type one in practice. And I feel like I&apos;m barely surviving the cuts.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cuts or not, I just don&apos;t want you to lose that part of you that makes you special,&quot; he says. &quot;My sons both have . . . had the same spark that I had. The knack. And I want you to live by it the rest of your life.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m working on it. With the job you have, you should know nothing&apos;s ideal more than anyone,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;We grab the trays, tilting them into the trash as we sip from a second refill. Having exhausted two weeks&apos; worth of real conversation at a man level, he rambles further about floor gossip all the way back, telling me to &quot;finish his damn redlines&quot; as he opens the shop door for me to get back to work.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;The rest of the day passes slowly when everybody else is gone: everybody besides Kei and I. The lifers leave early: forced to come in when it&apos;s still dark out so they can take care of their teenagers &mdash; or if they don&apos;t have kids, maybe drink at the bar or something. The young type-A engineers leave a little after so they can make the most of summer&apos;s long evenings, whether it&apos;s running or biking  out on the trails in the open fields between the housing developments, or finding the motivation somewhere to run a load of laundry.</p><p>&emsp;Then Nav leaves, and Reed and Kei say goodbye to him. Then Reed tries to talk to Kei, the only one left in the section, who responds with short yes-and-no answers unless he throws a free-response question at her. Then Reed drags a bunch of virtual cards around his computer, playing Solitaire for almost an hour until he can clock out half an hour longer than eight hours. Then he says goodbye to Kei, then it&apos;s absolutely silent for an hour beyond Kei&apos;s mouse clicks, and when 5:00 rolls around, I shoulder my bag and wave goodbye to the workaholic girl I have a crush on, reminding her that there&apos;s still a world out there.</p><p>&emsp;But this time, it felt different. And it&apos;s consistently felt a little different. Maybe Dad is right that I&apos;ve changed, because instead of leaving the long dragging hours of boredom to find respite in inaction, there&apos;s a part of me that wonders what&apos;s happening on the other side of the door.</p><p>&emsp;But it isn&apos;t much, and ever since I photocopied the rule sheet that Katiya and I wrote up, the first and last rule catch my eye every time I reach to open the door. Maybe it&apos;s just the prospect of that mystical threshold that fills me with excitement. Maybe it&apos;s the images and feelings she&apos;s left me with that I still fight like hell to resist. Or maybe it&apos;s fear of what could happen, overriding the boredom of modern life that comes when you get on the other side of adolescence.</p><p>&emsp;The house is silent when I pull in: the garage door groans as its panels screech back in place. Sometimes I imagine finding her sitting there with a bag of my chips in her combat armor, watching Netflix, but she&apos;s been so busy the last week or so, and even though I haven&apos;t found a reason to unlock my side of the door since we last went for that run, I feel the urge to let in a chance for something to happen.</p>"

        "<p id=\"2.18.1.4\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s up with all the rounds?&quot; Wilbur asks. &quot;It costs a lot of money to ask the machinist to clean up every edge like that.&quot;</p>",

Reed eagerly nods his head, and I think it&apos;s beyond the level where he&apos;s just listening until he can escape. All the while, I consider the different ways I can design the enclosure, sketching several different designs between scrolls through social media to keep up on the people I used to know.</p>",

The rusted wall fan makes enough noise that only Wilbur can hear my words, so I feel like I&apos;m able to speak openly. &quot;I think I just had a different idea of what engineering was. I liked designing things. But it was when something happened to me &mdash; or to someone in my family, I guess &mdash; that really made me chase it.&quot; I look at the 3D-printed mini model on my desk that I made to show my brother all those years ago.

        "<p id=\"2.18.1.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say. &quot;For Senior Design: after the incident, they let me pretty much be my own sponsor if I could fork the cash.&quot; I feel a rare sense of passion flood my body, and for a moment, I feel almost like Reed. &quot;I led the team to develop it: they let me take on some junior engineers at the school. And you see those gears?&quot; I point at a small pattern in the lines of PLA plastic.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.18.1.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp; &quot;Yeah. Heck &mdash; if this is like 1:10 scale, those must have been really small,&quot; Wilbur says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.18.1.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Took us damn near a month to find a solution for that. Bevel gears? And that small, with a D-shaft that didn&apos;t fit any existing gears we could order?&quot; My chest runs with the excitement of those days as my tongue spouts off with jargon. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t believe what we had to do to make it work. Last month of a senior project we had a whole year for, and that was the last thing we had to resolve.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.18.2.43\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.18.2.44\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s the ones that do it for the money. The lifers: satisfied with slow work that never changes, with such tribal knowledge that they&apos;d take the whole company down with them if they died.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.18.2.45\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;That sounds like me without the experience,&quot; I say. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.18.2.46\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But you&apos;re not,&quot; Dad says, shaking another fry at me. &quot;You have passion! You&apos;re going to design rockets one day. You&apos;re the dreaming type that wants more.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.18.2.47\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;All I dream of is not fucking up,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Type two in theory, type one in practice. And I feel like I&apos;m barely surviving the cuts.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.18.2.48\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Cuts or not, I just don&apos;t want you to lose that part of you that makes you special,&quot; he says. &quot;My sons both have . . . had the same spark that I had. The knack. And I want you to live by it the rest of your life.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.18.2.49\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m working on it. With the job you have, you should know nothing&apos;s ideal more than anyone,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.18.2.50\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;We grab the trays, tilting them into the trash as we sip from a second refill. Having exhausted two weeks&apos; worth of real conversation at a man level, he rambles further about floor gossip all the way back, telling me to &quot;finish his damn redlines&quot; as he opens the shop door for me to get back to work.</p>"
      ],
      [
        "<p id=\"2.18.3.1\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The rest of the day passes slowly when everybody else is gone: everybody besides Kei and I. The lifers leave early: forced to come in when it&apos;s still dark out so they can take care of their teenagers &mdash; or if they don&apos;t have kids, maybe drink at the bar or something. The young type-A engineers leave a little after so they can make the most of summer&apos;s long evenings, whether it&apos;s running or biking  out on the trails in the open fields between the housing developments, or finding the motivation somewhere to run a load of laundry.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.18.3.2\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Then Nav leaves, and Reed and Kei say goodbye to him. Then Reed tries to talk to Kei, the only one left in the section, who responds with short yes-and-no answers unless he throws a free-response question at her. Then Reed drags a bunch of virtual cards around his computer, playing Solitaire for almost an hour until he can clock out half an hour longer than eight hours. Then he says goodbye to Kei, then it&apos;s absolutely silent for an hour beyond Kei&apos;s mouse clicks, and when 5:00 rolls around, I shoulder my bag and wave goodbye to the workaholic girl I have a crush on, reminding her that there&apos;s still a world out there.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.18.3.3\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But this time, it felt different. And it&apos;s consistently felt a little different. Maybe Dad is right that I&apos;ve changed, because instead of leaving the long dragging hours of boredom to find respite in inaction, there&apos;s a part of me that wonders what&apos;s happening on the other side of the door.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.18.3.4\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But it isn&apos;t much, and ever since I photocopied the rule sheet that Katiya and I wrote up, the first and last rule catch my eye every time I reach to open the door. Maybe it&apos;s just the prospect of that mystical threshold that fills me with excitement. Maybe it&apos;s the images and feelings she&apos;s left me with that I still fight like hell to resist. Or maybe it&apos;s fear of what could happen, overriding the boredom of modern life that comes when you get on the other side of adolescence.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.18.3.5\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The house is silent when I pull in: the garage door groans as its panels screech back in place. Sometimes I imagine finding her sitting there with a bag of my chips in her combat armor, watching Netflix, but she&apos;s been so busy the last week or so, and even though I haven&apos;t found a reason to unlock my side of the door since we last went for that run, I feel the urge to let in a chance for something to happen.</p>"

      "<p>&emsp;I stumble through the dark since the window shades block twilight, leaving only three faint rectangles from the textured glass in the front door. The mounted television blinks blue, probably wise on me with all the automation tech &mdash; predicting that I&apos;ll waste another two hours scrolling through mediocre streaming selections before giving up to scroll on my phone.</p><p>&emsp;I check my messages. Two from Reed, averaging five a week: half about design work and half setting up a half-baked punchline. A text from my mother if I want anything from Costco. A picture from my college friends in California that got together, saying that they love me and miss me. And a text from Kei, saying she ran into our old Student Government advisor from high school.</p><p>&emsp;I break the cycle and decide to try making something for once, with the pots and pans that don&apos;t have so much as a burn mark worn into them. Instead of staving off Door Dash with another frozen meal, I decide to make spaghetti, finding the ingredients from months before when my mother hoarded all these goods to get me started.</p><p>&emsp;But I find myself walking to the door first: on a pathetic strand of hope, still caught up in the image of that improbable future. My stupid hand twists the lock in the door, fielding an array of excuses for why I&apos;d bother wedging myself back into the life of a girl with a fantasy boyfriend. The gusts from your world are better, and it seemed cooler over there, I think. I thought I heard an actual intruder this time. Or maybe I&apos;m bored. But no. That would be cringe.</p><p>&emsp;I settle on door unlocked, and feeling a little brave, I open the door a little: just so I can blame it on the wind if the door cracks. Cracking from being open, of course, because I was checking if the gateway was still there, but then something happened and I totally forgot to close it. </p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m not interested in her: only for that deal we made to help each other out a little (maybe), and maybe to go on another run or something. Stirring the pot of noodles, I think of the shape of her body when that skin-tight wetsuit was against her, wondering what else is under there, and then I shake my head, considering just going to bed so I can sleep in extra late and maybe get in to work, like, fifteen minutes early.</p><p>&emsp;But the air of my world floats into hers from the difference in pressure. It&apos;s warmer in my world. And when a gust flutters in, crashing the window shades against the wall, the aroma of simple spaghetti pushes enough to slam the door. </p><p>&emsp;But something catches it.</p><p>&emsp;Someone catches it?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hello?&quot; I try, stirring faster.</p><p>&emsp;The door hinges back just a little.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey there,&quot; she says, for the first time in a week or so. &quot;I wasn&apos;t leaning against the door or anything.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Leaning against the door?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, I was in my kitchen,&quot; she clarifies, peeking her head through the door. &quot;On the other side of my house.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; I say, not sure how it&apos;s relevant.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But I smell you&apos;re cooking something. Smells great,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. Just some saucy noodles,&quot; I say, since spaghetti isn&apos;t a cognate. &quot;I always make extra for leftovers, you know.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Leftovers?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Like extra food.&quot; She still peeks her head in. &quot;You can come in, you know,&quot; I say. &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;re enemies anymore.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m just never sure whether it&apos;s alright to come over, since I don&apos;t want to intrude or anything.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t go over because I hate getting attacked,&quot; I say, expecting a sly comeback. But she just looks tired. </p><p>&emsp;She shrugs. Her steel boots clatter on the linoleum as she advances to the marble counter, taking a seat at the table.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sorry. I meant that as a joke,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know,&quot; she says. &quot;Things have just been really slow. Concerningly slow.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And you&apos;re not afraid?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The front line&apos;s been pushed east almost as far as it&apos;s ever been.&quot; She twirls the sharp point of her dagger against the counter, brushing her hair to the side.</p><p>&emsp;I turn the heat off. &quot;And how&apos;s your distant, brooding boyfriend? Still both of those things?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It got better for a little while, after that run you set up for us,&quot; Katiya says. &quot;Oh, and how about you and that old flame of yours? Kei?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No fire here. Besides work talk and sending funny pictures to each other,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I thought your people were too advanced to speak in pictures,&quot; she says. A smile shows she&apos;s warming up just a little bit.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The Internet has ruined a lot of things for us,&quot; I tell her. I retrieve two bowls from the cabinet. &quot;Here. Want to try something else from my world? I promise it&apos;s not too intense on flavor.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We salt just about everything so it keeps, so I don&apos;t think it will ever be too much. None of us can afford those fancy new ice boxes,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;I hand her a serving. She&apos;s about to take a bite before she asks something else.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Say,&quot; she starts. &quot;I know &apos;boring&apos; in my world is intense for you, but it&apos;s boring. So . . . what do you do when you&apos;re bored?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Jerk off, I almost say.</p><p>&emsp;But I stop myself. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Play games. And, uh, stalk other people&apos;s lives online. And watch movies and shows,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Or read a book, if the power is out.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I was wondering if you could show me one of the films,&quot; she says. She takes a slurp of spaghetti. A look of sudden pleasure arrests her, and then she ravenously takes another bite.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; I ask, feeling a little excited. I toss my backpack on the small chair so only the couch is open, before I realize what I&apos;m doing.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How do you get these pictures? Do you have to go somewhere in the car to get a reel?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nope,&quot; I say, settling in on the right side of the futon as I gesture to the space next to me. &quot;The nineties is over. They&apos;re all inside the box right there.&quot; I lift the remote and press the power button. The screen lights up with several selections: the criteria a little different now that one of us hasn&apos;t seen a single one of them.</p><p>&emsp;She sets the plate on the kitchen counter, removing the light armor from her body with a gasp of relief. I find her wearing the surf shirt underneath: still stretched in the logo, and I hope she&apos;s washed it since last time.</p><p>&emsp;She plops down next to me, taking more of the pasta into her mouth with another slurp. &quot;So those are all the choices?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s called a menu,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Like in a restaurant.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; she says. &quot;But there are so many choices!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I laugh. &quot;That&apos;s the problem with my world. So how about this: what kind of story do you want to watch?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She looks puzzled. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like an action movie? A funny movie? Fantasy? Futuristic? Or a&mdash;&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about that one?&quot; She points to the top left corner. &quot;Two people meeting each other sounds like a simple start. Not too crazy, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s, uh . . . probably a little too intense for you, I think.&quot; My face flushes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please,&quot; she says, flexing an arm: &quot;I&apos;m more adventurous than you&apos;ll ever be. Whatever this missus Sally and mister Harry are doing can&apos;t be that bad!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That movie is a romance story,&quot; I say. &quot;A romantic comedy. And your world hasn&apos;t even invented two-piece swimsuits yet. I think you&apos;d faint before the title card!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Her face reddens. &quot;A romantic story? But isn&apos;t that so shameless?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;And then the preview loads, after I left the cursor on it for too long. </p><p>&emsp;Sally gets a little too flustered in the restaurant, moaning loudly with erotic pleasure. Katiya flinches, slapping the remote out of my hand and blasting it across the room with two of its batteries. I scramble to pick up the pieces in the darkness as the scene plays out: Katiya&apos;s face flushing further into a rose color as she laughs uncomfortably.</p><p>&emsp;I manage to slide the double-A batteries in and take control, switching over to something else: that Gerard Butler flick where he has a talk show about romance.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So indecent,&quot; she says, covering her mouth and her eyes as she giggles: too innocent for such adulterous media, though I doubt she&apos;s a stranger to the concept.</p><p>&emsp;I return to my spot on the couch. &quot;Wait a second . . . You&apos;ve never been that pleasured over a meal?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; she says. &quot;Do your people do that? No &mdash; your people don&apos;t do that. No. No . . . do they?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course!&quot; I say. &quot;I expected you to be weak in the knees after this bitchin&apos; bowl of spaghetti.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re lying.&quot; She rubs her cheeks, but they don&apos;t get any paler. And when she finds my smug grin from between her fingers, she punches me in the arm. &quot;You&apos;re lying!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Alright, fine. But it&apos;s getting late. Can we pick something, already?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about that one?&quot; She points to the picture of a small rabbit standing in front of a train.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just watched that one the other week,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;I scan around a little longer. And since Lord Of The Rings is too long, I settle on The Hunger Games.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why this one?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The main character reminds me of you,&quot; I tell her. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please, just tell me it&apos;s not a romance,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s mostly action. Strong female lead and a boy that&apos;s a baker,&quot; I tell her. &quot;But every story has to have a little bit of romance.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She turns to me with disgust.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t mean it like that. I swear,&quot; I tell her. </p><p>&emsp;She ducks her head so her bangs cover her eyes. &quot;Well . . . there&apos;s nothing wrong with a little bit, you know,&quot; she says, twirling a strand of hair.</p><p>&emsp;I shift my eyes from the screen.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like, in a picture,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;And then Katiya watches the first movie she&apos;s ever seen.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I awake at 4:30 to find her breathing softly next to me: a line of drool sliding down my chin, and her hands tensioned on my arm as she buries her face into my shoulder, flinching sporadically.</p><p>&emsp;The autoplay ran so long that it stopped on the third one before asking if we were STILL WATCHING. And when I reach to grab the remote, I find she grips me with such immovable force that I have no reach.</p><p>&emsp;I fiddle with my foot until I feel the power button on my toe through the sock, and turn off the TV.</p><p>&emsp;I shake her gently. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya. Katiya?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She moves a little, tightening her grasp.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya, we have work tomorrow,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;She mumbles.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh?&quot; I get closer, drawing a breath of her exhale.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Stay,&quot; she mutters.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But work tomorrow. We have to...&quot; </p><p>&emsp;No response.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s still dark enough that if I shut my eyes, I might be able to convince myself it&apos;s late instead of early. So I set the standard alarm on my phone, check her for weapons so she won&apos;t ambush me when it goes off, and find a comfortable place for my head when my arm is stuck to her.</p><p>&emsp;I rest my head on hers: the place it was before, and the only place I find it can go. The odd warmth of her body quickly sets me to sleep, and I sleep better in those three hours than I think I have in months.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;The charred cabin calls me back in my dreams. Maybe it knows I&apos;m going to visit today. And though I&apos;ve slept night after night feeling the warmth of my Essenced flesh scald with the memory of the fire, I find a chill course through my body. A lone figure that shoulders the weight of the beam with a wry smile, and though their silhouette is irreconcilable through the smoke, I feel safe for just long enough.</p><p>&emsp;He&apos;s speaking my name, over and over, saying I have to work, but I&apos;m just a child. He looks like he&apos;s going to leave me again, to strand me in the smoke and soot, and so I plead him to stay. And when I think I&apos;ll end up all alone again, he never leaves, and a coolness rests against my head, setting me off to dream of the forest, exploring the lands of Hillfar when the town of a thousand felled trees still stood tall.</p><p>&emsp;I feel a sense of safety, of security, and a feeling I haven&apos;t had the space for in a long time begins to stir within me: one that makes me want to squeeze with all my might and transfer all of this sense of fullness. To dissolve. I feel an emptiness I was blind to for so long: a deepening void that longs to be filled with something whole a thousand times over, and when I finally feel the coldness of the form that compliments my heat, I pull it in, only to wake when it crunches under my strength.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s a pillow.</p><p>&emsp;I hear a staccato of beeps from the kitchenette. A nobleman &mdash; no, Cody &mdash; is cooking something savory in the hot box.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Morning, sleepyhead,&quot; Cody says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I . . . Gods damn it, I fell asleep here again! I was so tired, and after such an awful day...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey. It&apos;s alright,&quot; Cody says: dressed in his fancy noble clothes with neatly-creased pants and a shave.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What time is it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He checks the glowing numbers on the stove. &quot;Uh, almost seven. I got up a little early in case you had to get up even earlier,&quot; he says. &quot;What does your world run on?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Did you hear a loud knock?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, not yet, I don&apos;t think. Is that&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;And then the sound raps across the portal: I must already be conditioned enough to not even need it.  A friendly voice calls my name.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;ll have to get ready right away. I&apos;ll need bread from the other world again, from Derry and his wife, without time to cook something thoughtful.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I made you a breakfast burrito,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;From the same people that brought you the taco. Hard chewy meat shell, I think you called it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, really?&quot; I ask. He chows into his own wrapped meat pouch: yellowed with eggs and something else inside. &quot;It must have taken you ages to get all those ingredients ready!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Costco, frozen section. Don&apos;t you remember?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course I don&apos;t,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;He hands the plate to me as I rush for the door, making a gesture with his hand.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;May the odds be ever in your favor,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;I grimace. &quot;Are you making fun of the way I talk?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; he says, &quot;the movie? When did you fall asleep?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I have to go,&quot; I say, rushing to the door before Bertram will come knocking.</p><p>&emsp;I slam it shut behind me, reaching to lock it &mdash; but then I hesitate, opening the door just a crack like I did last night, then peeking through the threshold again.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And thanks, Cody.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Stay awake next time,&quot; he says, waving goodbye as he slings his rucksack over his shoulder.</p>"

        "<p id=\"2.19.1.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Leftovers?&quot; She asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Like extra food.&quot; She still peeks her head in. &quot;You can come in, you know,&quot; I say. &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;re enemies anymore.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m just never sure whether it&apos;s alright to come over, since I don&apos;t want to intrude or anything.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t go over because I hate getting attacked,&quot; I say, expecting a sly comeback. But she just looks tired. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She shrugs. Her steel boots clatter on the linoleum as she advances to the marble counter, taking a seat at the table.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.23\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Sorry. I meant that as a joke,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I know,&quot; she says. &quot;Things have just been really slow. Concerningly slow.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;And you&apos;re not afraid?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;The front line&apos;s been pushed east almost as far as it&apos;s ever been.&quot; She twirls the sharp point of her dagger against the counter, brushing her hair to the side.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I turn the heat off. &quot;And how&apos;s your distant, brooding boyfriend? Still both of those things?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;It got better for a little while, after that run you set up for us,&quot; Katiya says. &quot;Oh, and how about you and that old flame of yours? Kei?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No fire here. Besides work talk and sending funny pictures to each other,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I thought your people were too advanced to speak in pictures,&quot; she says. A smile shows she&apos;s warming up just a little bit.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;The Internet has ruined a lot of things for us,&quot; I tell her. I retrieve two bowls from the cabinet. &quot;Here. Want to try something else from my world? I promise it&apos;s not too intense on flavor.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;We salt just about everything so it keeps, so I don&apos;t think it will ever be too much. None of us can afford those fancy new ice boxes,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I hand her a serving. She&apos;s about to take a bite before she asks something else.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.34\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Say,&quot; she starts. &quot;I know &apos;boring&apos; in my world is intense for you, but it&apos;s boring. So . . . what do you do when you&apos;re bored?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.35\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Jerk off, I almost say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.36\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But I stop myself. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.37\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Play games. And, uh, stalk other people&apos;s lives online. And watch movies and shows,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Or read a book, if the power is out.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.38\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I was wondering if you could show me one of the films,&quot; she says. She takes a slurp of spaghetti. A look of sudden pleasure arrests her, and then she ravenously takes another bite.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.39\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; I ask, feeling a little excited. I toss my backpack on the small chair so only the couch is open, before I realize what I&apos;m doing.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.40\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;How do you get these pictures? Do you have to go somewhere in the car to get a reel?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.41\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Nope,&quot; I say, settling in on the right side of the futon as I gesture to the space next to me. &quot;The nineties is over. They&apos;re all inside the box right there.&quot; I lift the remote and press the power button. The screen lights up with several selections: the criteria a little different now that one of us hasn&apos;t seen a single one of them.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.42\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She sets the plate on the kitchen counter, removing the light armor from her body with a gasp of relief. I find her wearing the surf shirt underneath: still stretched in the logo, and I hope she&apos;s washed it since last time.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.43\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She plops down next to me, taking more of the pasta into her mouth with another slurp. &quot;So those are all the choices?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.44\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s called a menu,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Like in a restaurant.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.45\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; she says. &quot;But there are so many choices!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.46\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I laugh. &quot;That&apos;s the problem with my world. So how about this: what kind of story do you want to watch?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.47\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She looks puzzled. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.48\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Like an action movie? A funny movie? Fantasy? Futuristic? Or a&mdash;&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.49\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;How about that one?&quot; She points to the top left corner. &quot;Two people meeting each other sounds like a simple start. Not too crazy, right?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.50\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s, uh . . . probably a little too intense for you, I think.&quot; My face flushes.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.51\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Please,&quot; she says, flexing an arm: &quot;I&apos;m more adventurous than you&apos;ll ever be. Whatever this missus Sally and mister Harry are doing can&apos;t be that bad!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.52\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;That movie is a romance story,&quot; I say. &quot;A romantic comedy. And your world hasn&apos;t even invented two-piece swimsuits yet. I think you&apos;d faint before the title card!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.53\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Her face reddens. &quot;A romantic story? But isn&apos;t that so shameless?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.54\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;And then the preview loads, after I left the cursor on it for too long. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.55\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Sally gets a little too flustered in the restaurant, moaning loudly with erotic pleasure. Katiya flinches, slapping the remote out of my hand and blasting it across the room with two of its batteries. I scramble to pick up the pieces in the darkness as the scene plays out: Katiya&apos;s face flushing further into a rose color as she laughs uncomfortably.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.56\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I manage to slide the double-A batteries in and take control, switching over to something else: that Gerard Butler flick where he has a talk show about romance.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.57\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;So indecent,&quot; she says, covering her mouth and her eyes as she giggles: too innocent for such adulterous media, though I doubt she&apos;s a stranger to the concept.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.58\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I return to my spot on the couch. &quot;Wait a second . . . You&apos;ve never been that pleasured over a meal?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.59\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; she says. &quot;Do your people do that? No &mdash; your people don&apos;t do that. No. No . . . do they?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.60\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Of course!&quot; I say. &quot;I expected you to be weak in the knees after this bitchin&apos; bowl of spaghetti.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.61\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re lying.&quot; She rubs her cheeks, but they don&apos;t get any paler. And when she finds my smug grin from between her fingers, she punches me in the arm. &quot;You&apos;re lying!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.62\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Alright, fine. But it&apos;s getting late. Can we pick something, already?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.63\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;How about that one?&quot; She points to the picture of a small rabbit standing in front of a train.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.64\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I just watched that one the other week,&quot; I say. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.65\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I scan around a little longer. And since Lord Of The Rings is too long, I settle on The Hunger Games.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.66\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Why this one?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.67\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;The main character reminds me of you,&quot; I tell her. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.68\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Please, just tell me it&apos;s not a romance,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.69\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s mostly action. Strong female lead and a boy that&apos;s a baker,&quot; I tell her. &quot;But every story has to have a little bit of romance.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.70\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She turns to me with disgust.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.71\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t mean it like that. I swear,&quot; I tell her. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.72\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She ducks her head so her bangs cover her eyes. &quot;Well . . . there&apos;s nothing wrong with a little bit, you know,&quot; she says, twirling a strand of hair.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.1.73\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I shift my eyes from the screen.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.19.2.2\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The autoplay ran so long that it stopped on the third one before asking if we were STILL WATCHING. And when I reach to grab the remote, I find she grips me with such immovable force that I have no reach.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.19.2.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I rest my head on hers: the place it was before, and the only place I find it can go. The odd warmth of her body quickly sets me to sleep, and I sleep better in those three hours than I think I have in months.</p>"

And though I&apos;ve slept night after night feeling the warmth of my Essenced flesh scald with the memory of the fire, I find a chill course through my body. A lone figure that shoulders the weight of the beam with a wry smile, and though their silhouette is irreconcilable through the smoke, I feel safe for just long enough.</p>",

And when I think I&apos;ll end up all alone again, he never leaves, and a coolness rests against my head, setting me off to dream of the forest, exploring the lands of Hillfar when the town of a thousand felled trees still stood tall.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.19.3.3\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I feel a sense of safety, of security, and a feeling I haven&apos;t had the space for in a long time begins to stir within me: one that makes me want to squeeze with all my might and transfer all of this sense of fullness. To dissolve. I feel an emptiness I was blind to for so long: a deepening void that longs to be filled with something whole a thousand times over, and when I finally feel the coldness of the form that compliments my heat, I pull it in, only to wake when it crunches under my strength.</p>",

      "<p>&emsp; I refuse to let in a chance for anything to happen, and that&apos;s why I rise early. Earlier than the knocker that comes to wake me. Earlier than the sun: early enough that the morning hours mask my presence while I wear the hood of my uniform, tucking my golden locks of braided hair beneath the fabric.</p><p>&emsp;There&apos;s still the early risers that do their training in the mornings, and with the approach of our first competencies that all city guards are required to take, the training fields and the alleys between the barracks bustle with far more sweaty servicemen.</p><p>&emsp;So it&apos;s no surprise when the cover of dusk no longer hides me. I hear their whispers when I pass &mdash; or maybe half the time I think I hear them &mdash; calling me &quot;choke&quot; and making a gagging motion, or asking again why I even bothered, some even saying I&apos;d be better suited &quot;for the shady brothels where I could at least be paid to choke on something.&quot; Gossip is easy. Giving up is easy, too: but when I feel the weight of the house key in my pocket, trying to estimate how much heavier it was before the first cadet failed their trials, I remember the other choice is death, and it&apos;s a much stronger wind in my sails than whatever storm these troglodytes can throw at me.</p><p>&emsp;My shoulder scrapes the left wall as I take every narrow alley I can. It&apos;s the first day I&apos;ve decided to visit him, because for the last two weeks, I&apos;ve rued the thought of leaving the infirmary to face their ridicule in broad daylight, though none of them have ever faced anything close to what I&apos;ve fought.</p><p>&emsp;His messages told me that he&apos;d crack the back door of his room in the single-story medical building, and when I find some old, thick tome called FEAR THE CHYMAERA wedged in one of the doors, I cautiously creak it open.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So you finally came to check on me,&quot; Bertram says. Despite his graze with death, he&apos;s the clearest example of why the Royal Guard juice their soldiers on heavy Essence. &quot;You saved me just in time. The medic said my organs would start shutting down, one by one, if you arrived any later.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He gets up from the bed in his white hospital gown labeled HARLOWE-B, stretching with a few twists before he approaches. Despite the pallidness of his skin, and the darkened marks on his extremities from where the Chymaeran Curse seized his body, he seems no less capable than any day I&apos;ve seen him before.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So why are you still here?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The damage is inside, and it will take a while to heal,&quot; Bertram says. &quot;My outside is as handsome as ever, but that assassin did a number on my insides. Said I can&apos;t start training again for another two weeks or so.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh,&quot; I say. I sit at the chair next to the window. Between the gravel lot outside and the brutal concrete walls, it feels more like a prison infirmary than anything else. &quot;I think I&apos;d get sicker just by staying in this room,&quot; I say. &quot;Do you get to walk around outside, at least?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not really,&quot; he says. &quot;But thinking of the effort you guys put into saving me, it makes me feel full.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I smile. &quot;You&apos;re worth it. Plus, I kind of owed you for a while.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I wish I could have a cool scar like you,&quot; he says, tracing a finger across his face from brow to cheek. &quot;You must be celebrated out there for all that. Have you paid for a single drink at the bar since then?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My smile fades. &quot;It&apos;s easier to talk poorly about people than to praise them. And I choked a little too much.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But a noble is alive because of you!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But the wife won&apos;t forgive me. She made a whole show of it at the town hall before they left. Blamed it all on me, though I didn&apos;t pull the trigger.&quot; I sigh. &quot;But at least Aldrin knows the worth of my efforts.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He rummages under his bed. &quot;Well, it might have been a while ago, but I think I can be the first,&quot; he says. I hear the clatter of glass as he tears through his meager possessions that they let him hold on to. A drawing of the two of us floats across the floor, and I recognize the artistry from my father.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;When was this?&quot; I ask. &quot;And why was it here?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He blushes: the first sign of life I&apos;ve seen on his pallid face as he holds two bottles. &quot;Just remembering the ones that got me through it,&quot; he says, and then he hands me one. &quot;Ryder and Pax and Cae came by last week. They smuggled in a six-pack, so we had four of them. But I saved two for the day you came back.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I laugh, looking around cautiously as I grasp the neck of the bottle. The Essenced heat of my hands heats the metal cap enough for it to expand, popping off with a light thunk, and we cheers over half-a-success and half-a-failure. </p><p>&emsp;But I can tell something is still on his mind. And after he wets his mouth a couple times with the ale, quickly chugging so we can hide the evidence, he finally speaks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You know, I thought about some stuff when I was on the edge,&quot; he says, sitting on the left side of the hospital bed in his white gown. &quot;I thought about all the things I hadn&apos;t done yet. That I regretted putting off.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I understand that fear completely,&quot; I say, as I sit beside him. &quot;The world is so random and chaotic, sometimes it makes you wonder if the Gods stopped watching a long time ago. But you&apos;ve been blessed with more time.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;More time to express my feelings,&quot; he says: a look of hesitation on his face. &quot;In the week I was on the brink of death, I wrote letters in case I didn&apos;t make it. But then I survived. I started healing quickly, and with a second shot, I decided I should go back to the place it all began.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My stomach twists at the thought. &quot;You&apos;ve lived don&apos;t mean&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And not alone,&quot; he says. &quot;I want to go back to the place our lives changed forever. I want to go to Hillfar with you, and I want to tell you something. And that&apos;s why,&quot; he reaches behind his back to retrieve two familiar forms, &quot;I insisted that the guildscribes make it official.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Going back there. I mean&mdash;&quot; I stammer.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;If you&apos;re not ready yet, I get it. But I think it would be good for us, and I just wanted you to be aware, so you can prepare yourself.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I look at the quest form: neatly written in the script of the guildscribes. A high-value, four-star quest, with the purpose written in Bertram&apos;s block script that reads FACING A FORMIDABLE PAST.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Those days in Hillfar cross my thoughts every day,&quot; I say. &quot;I thought time would dull them, but I still feel like I&apos;m there right now.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; he says, looking down at his own sheet.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The quest involves going there. And I feel like I have to fully convince myself I&apos;ve left before I go back.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then I&apos;ll be patiently waiting,&quot; he assures me. He reaches to grab my hand. &quot;You&apos;re the strongest person I know.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I tension his hand in mine on a spark of courage. &quot;But I swear to Khiras that I&apos;ll find it in me before this ends. By the end of this season,&quot; I tell him, &quot;I promise you and I will return.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Bertram&apos;s smile creases with the dimples he&apos;s had since he was a child, taking my quest form to return it to the folder. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;And if you can do that, then maybe I can find the courage, too,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;To go there?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;More than that,&quot; he replies. &quot;But it doesn&apos;t matter yet. It seems you&apos;re the one that will have to be brave first.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We leave the challenge at that. Another ten minutes pass before we hear the nurses start to make their morning rounds, so I stuff the two bottles in my rucksack neck-up, along with the thick paper doorstop.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;re going on a local quest with double-L, huh?&quot; Bertram asks, reclining back in his bed as he opens an illustrated book about Blackwater. &quot;He must have had his come-to-Khiras moment about you. Or maybe he feels like he&apos;s in trouble.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No&mdash;he just has the first group of friends he&apos;s ever had,&quot; I say. &quot;I want him to enjoy them. Because I know he&apos;ll come back.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;With an apology, I hope,&quot; Bertram says.</p><p>&emsp;I disappear through the door just as the nurse announces his name. The lock clicks in place as I draw my hood, dissolving back between the alleys as morning turns to day.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;&quot;I want to apologize to you,&quot; Jullian says.</p><p>&emsp;He takes my hand as we swelter inside the guard tent. I thought an open-air bazaar meant a cooling breeze might flow through every once in a while&mdash;or that the tattered tarp above our heads might block the rays&mdash;but the air scalds our lungs like sitting in a kiln.</p><p>&emsp;He parts his chapped lips, and his eyes trace the floor in the same tick of nervousness he&apos;s had since I met him. But there are still signs we&apos;ve grown together. And when he takes another pull off his second fill of the canteen, his eyes meet mine, and he doesn&apos;t hesitate to speak his mind.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry because I feel like I&apos;ve gotten carried away,&quot; he says. &quot;Away from all the burdens of the old days: days we spent taking care of our siblings when our moms were working to put food on the table, and now that I have the chance to make my first group of friends, it&apos;s like taking off ankle weights. And all I want to do is run.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;As long as you don&apos;t run away,&quot; I say. I tension my sweaty fingers in his, and he returns my strength. &quot;You should have fun during this please. We should both enjoy it: we gave so much of our lives to be here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He nods.</p><p>&emsp;I say, &quot;And I want to enjoy it together with you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;And you&apos;ve just been so far away,&quot; I say: careful to distill my emotions through the joy of a love I feel so strongly. &quot;We promised to be candid to each other, and . . . when you leave so early in the morning, before I can even wake to see you or touch you, it just makes me feel so alone.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;m sorry,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why do you have to leave all the time?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He stands up, approaching the edge of the canvas window. &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t know?&quot; I approach, refusing to let him escape again. &quot;How can you not know?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s just . . . I&apos;ve spent my whole life living for others. For my siblings, my family&mdash;almost like a good childhood skipped me&mdash;and I was forced to give it all away to the ones that came after. And now,&quot; he says, &quot;I have this freedom I&apos;ve never had before, and I don&apos;t know what to do with it. And any time I wake up sitting there, just standing still, I feel like I&apos;m spending the last seconds of my youth before I get too old to live it, just full of regret.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you weren&apos;t there,&quot; I tell him. He struggles to look at me, but I can sense the pain of loneliness no different than mine. &quot;Why didn&apos;t you stand up for me, or at least come to visit in the days after the attempt on that noble&apos;s life? Were you . . . ashamed of me?&quot; I remember when he couldn&apos;t even return my gaze when we entered the hall with Bertram. It might have been the first event that precipitated this long spiral.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I had a moment of weakness,&quot; he says. &quot;I should have been there, but every second I wasn&apos;t, this guilt just kept getting greater and greater, until the point that I was afraid of facing you. That you&apos;d think I deserted you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you did,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;ve been terrified of this moment ever since,&quot; he says. He brushes a strand of stray hair over my ear. His gauntlets grasp the side of my head, tracing his thumb on my cheek. &quot;I&apos;ve always hated this weakness I&apos;ve felt my entire life. This cowardice, of a boy that never made friends, made fun of, and was so scared and unchallenged that he never tried to fly.&quot; He tears up a little. &quot;And I guess I&apos;ve taken for granted the one thing I&apos;ve thought I would always have, supporting me through it all. You,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;The anger and sorrow mix at just a level that I feel them rest at a stalemate. &quot;I want to be there for you, Jullian. But I need you to try, just try, to be there for me. And to stay,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;I tension my arms around his waist, ducking my head beneath his neck as he buries his head into my hair. I mumble something into his chestplate that he doesn&apos;t hear.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I said, this isn&apos;t very comfortable,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;We share a laugh, glancing out across the bustling market: a mosaic of merchants and shoppers browsing and bartering beneath the thin linen.</p><p>&emsp;His mouth curls in a grin after he finds the space to relax again. &quot;You know I love you, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know that,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just thought about what that guy you were with the other day said, you know.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The &apos;science guy?&apos;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I bet he&apos;s just jealous,&quot; he says. A familiar glare of envy glazes in his eyes. &quot;I think when this is over, we should ditch the armor and&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;A sudden commotion stirs beneath one of the tents when we hear shouts far louder than usual.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;I mean, we should ditch the armor and&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Where is that coming from?&quot; I look at today&apos;s vendor map, counting three rows over as an assailant wrangles something from beneath a table. My finger traces the map as my other hand finds the marching tent. It&apos;s one of the high-end Essence technology-dealing tables.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We need to get over there,&quot; I say. The cable lines are in place, spanning across the market from the top of the tower. And my hand can take the heat of the friction.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not your job, Katiya,&quot; he says. &quot;We just wire it in to Command, and they dispatch the experienced guards!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I feel something twist inside me. &quot;But it will be too late. And we have the height to&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just don&apos;t want you to get hurt again,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;The thief is already running across the market. And I see the span of cable that can take me to intercept. </p><p>&emsp;He adds, &quot;Just stop trying to be a hero and stay close to me!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t get it,&quot; I say, leaping out the window before he can grab the back of my cloak, before my mind can catch up on what I&apos;m doing, as I withdraw the channeled metal hand-hold and put my full weight on the wire from two stories up.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m lucky my panic catches when I&apos;m two stories off the ground: gravity doesn&apos;t hinder my hesitation, but only aids it. The panic makes me hold fast to the metal contact: siphoning the friction of the Essence into my circuits in a rejuvenating reversal.</p><p>&emsp;The energy cycles through my body from my arms to my legs, and though my blood freezes with the initial surge of panic, my circuits are scalding with power. The vibrations in the tether rattle the bones in my arms, casting sparks of hot iron, and when I&apos;m close enough to drop and run, I use the force of the fall to dig the toe of my boots between cobblestones. And with all the energy I&apos;ve stored from letting the blood pool in my legs for four hours&mdash;sitting in tight, padded pants&mdash;all I want to do is run.</p><p>&emsp;The stones shift their alignment when my boots break the ground. The assailant runs west, crossing back through the market, and though they&apos;re a few rows over, shrouded in a tattered crimson hood with an Essence Tool beneath their arm, I&apos;m still the closest to catching them.</p><p>&emsp;We weave between crowds at different speeds. While I waste momentum weaving around civilians, they cut straight through them&mdash;but still, they&apos;re uncommonly quick for a human, and it&apos;s when the wind sheds their disguise that I see the cat ears. Long locks of black hair trail behind them, and in the absence of short fur, it means they&apos;re a half-blood, dipping into their gift of Ahkvan Essence to accelerate time around them.</p><p>&emsp;I vault over the table of a turquoise tent where Kine changes hands. Now the thief is right ahead of me, and instead of shouting, I save my breath to run faster. Time dilates ever-so-slightly around them, casting their shaded features in blue, but I wager that their abilities are nothing compared to my compass.</p><p>&emsp;But all my running has prepared me for this. As they break the edge of the market, approaching the thin line of houses separating the industrial district and old Gaffesend Castle, it seems they&apos;re familiar with Gaffesend&apos;s best abandoned places to hide.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian shouts something behind me, straining his voice trying to get me to stop, as several other guards give chase. But as we weave between narrow alleys of the tenement homes, I&apos;m the only one that can see the half-blood thief.</p><p>&emsp;The edge of the district is coming near, where a long wooden fence partitions the district from all the abandoned spaces. The assailant takes their time to amble over the edge with the Essenced artifact, and by the time their feet land on the other side, I charge my Essence enough to directly blast myself straight through the wood, casting charred chips of timber toward the abandoned buildings, knowing I&apos;ll be paying for it later with another domestic quest.</p><p>&emsp;I can see them clearer now that we&apos;re neck-and-neck, and I recognize the tattered cloak looks familiar as it billows behind her. Three steps behind, we approach the old castle shed, separated from the grounds of the Estate. To a layman, it would be a dead end&mdash;but for someone with knowledge of the Royal Guards&mdash;it&apos;s an ancient egress point, and when she enters the small storeroom lined with aged tools from centuries ago, she knows to slip beneath the busted trapdoor to drop down into the ancient tunnels.</p><p>&emsp;If only I had this much adrenaline during the parade, maybe the outcome would be different, because from all the energy coursing through my circuits and veins, I don&apos;t think twice about dropping down into the old escape tunnels. Her boots splash in the murky water, crunching the bones of forgotten skeletons that fought the front lines  five hundred years ago. When I land in the calf-high sludge, I cast a plume of fire that bounces between the walls, lighting the lines of the long earthen tomb until it sizzles in the water, just long enough to see her silhouette shrink down the straightaway.</p><p>&emsp;But I&apos;m not letting her go.</p><p>&emsp;A persistent flame materializes above my head, flickering with the musty air as I trudge-run through the roughly-hewn tunnel. The splashing gets louder as I gain on her, turning right, then left, then left again, as I try to remember the maps from the briefing all those months ago.</p><p>&emsp;My race&apos;s skill with healing means I&apos;m sensitive to others&mdash;and when I attenuate her vitals, I can feel her exhaustion, fighting for breath as we approach what looks like a dead end, only to burst through a door to a stairwell that takes us up into the castle courtyard.</p><p>&emsp;I find the energy to yell. &quot;You&apos;re not getting away from me,&quot; I shout, and when we break the threshold of the courtyard, we find drifters and vagrants making camp with tattered sheets, stoking fires with their meager Essence. She scales the stairs of the main edifice, and I wonder why she gains height when it only means she&apos;s getting further from the ground.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m close enough now that I can feel the wind she displaces. She grabs for a steaming pot and launches it at me, casting a spray of boiling soup, but I duck out of the way, regathering my footing as she tries throwing down debris to trip me.</p><p>&emsp;But she wasted too much on the offense. I grab her cloak as we crest the stairs of the old hall, so crumbled from war and the elements that sunlight streams through the ceiling and walls.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Enough,&quot; I shout.</p><p>&emsp;But she tears out a shortsword with her other hand, slicing through the fabric as I stumble. With the Essence Tool still cradled in her arm, she draws her weapon to face me. I drop the scrap of fabric, realizing from touch that it&apos;s a guard cloak.</p><p>&emsp;Her sharp blue eyes catch the trainee insignia on my armor, along with my identifying number. &quot;A replacement,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;We circle around a table. &quot;You stole that cloak from a guard,&quot; I say, as I draw my sword. &quot;Reinforcements are right behind me. You have nowhere to go!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re as disposable as I was,&quot; she says. &quot;Your number. Starting with eighty-four means they have you in the house with the lake view.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How could you know that?&quot; I ask, but I don&apos;t let her mind games shake me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because your name is coming off that damn key just like mine was, and you&apos;ll have nothing,&quot; she shouts, ripping the table aside as she takes her first swing at me.</p><p>&emsp;We trade blows, fighting in a hall that the old Knights once trained in, clashing our swords with echoes of an ancient past. I remember Derry, the baker, and a name that crests my lips as I try to remember.</p><p>&emsp;Our circling runs me into the edge of a table, and unable to evade, she drives at me with a powerful blow, buffeting me with the Essence Tool. I stumble, nearly dropping my sword as she slices across my breastplate, catching metal instead of flesh.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Aleena,&quot; I say. &quot;Why do you do this?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She pauses for a moment, as if she&apos;d really give an answer. But then she runs for the spiral staircase to the upper floors, and I give chase, just as I hear the other lagging guards approach the hall.</p><p>&emsp;I take two steps at a time, casting sparks as my steel pauldtons scrape the side of the stairwell. I can hear her footfalls directly above me as we get higher and higher and higher, until we reach the very top. </p><p>&emsp;She&apos;s running out of avenues to escape. All that&apos;s left are the buildings of the old industrial district that border the castle, and when we&apos;re four stories up, running across ramparts that look out to a stark cliffside bordering the forest, I doubt she has anywhere to go.</p><p>&emsp;But then she jumps onto a roof of a wooden building in the servants&apos; quarter. She yelps when her foot crashes through the ceiling, withdrawing as I decide to approach from the other side, aiming for the central beam id the frame instead of the eaves.</p><p>&emsp;We&apos;re neck-and-neck as she lumbers with the stolen tool and I struggle with my armor, not quite in grabbing distance when the fall is too much of a consequence. She&apos;s heading for the other side of the castle rampart bordering the industrial warehouses, and when I think I&apos;m about to grab her, she channels all her Essence into accelerating for one final sprint.</p><p>&emsp;My breath tastes like poison when it leaves my lungs. Falling further behind, I watch as she runs directly for the edge of the castle wall, as if to jump to her death. But without hesitation, she clambers onto a straightaway of stone slabs, managing seven strides before she launches herself over the edge.</p><p>&emsp;She vanishes from sight. And I wager she&apos;s planned this all from the start: planning to live and steal another day, so before the hesitation seizes my muscles, I take the same seven steps and launch myself over the edge.</p><p>&emsp;I can feel the turbulence of wind as gravity comes to collect on my four-story climb. Behind me, I hear Jullian cry my name, and beneath me, a yawning gap spans a thousand years of progress between the old castle and the tall industrial building.</p><p>&emsp;We float in the air at the same time, flying like the Auvryan angels of their floating lands. Her Ahkvan reflexes give her just shy of nine lives to land. I hinge my legs in anticipation of crashing into the gravel roof, and after she rolls off her fall, I thrust myself with a plume of flames to break my speed enough to twist myself into a barrel roll.</p><p>&emsp;The roof is small, high, and flat, surrounded by the stark eaves of industrial buildings that are unnavigable. Out of breath, she rushes for the roof access door, only to find it locked, desperately jimmying the round handle as she groans in exasperation.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Drop it,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;She complies, placing the artifact on the ground. &quot;As soon as I failed that test, I was always destined to die. So do whatever you have to do with me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I quickly glance to the edge of the castle wall, so much higher than I remember. All the guards descended the stairs, running around to reconvene inside the warehouse. And I make a decision. </p><p>&emsp;I reach past her, tensioning my fingers against the knob as it glows with scalding heat.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What are you doing? But aren&apos;t you going to take me in? I&apos;m a part of the Den Of Thieves now!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You and I aren&apos;t that different. Just separated by time, I fear.&quot; I gesture for the door. &quot;She got away. But she dropped the high-value tool she might have used to aid the enemy.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;A look of shameful relief flushes her face. Sweat mixes with tears she refuses to allow to break the threshold of her eyes. &quot;I never wanted it to end up this way,&quot; she says. &quot;Aren&apos;t you afraid they&apos;ll send you to die? And then what will you do?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I tell her. &quot;But you can choose something else.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She makes for the stairway as I hear a dozen footfalls reach the gravel lot below. Then she hesitates. &quot;There&apos;s something brewing from the East, I hear,&quot; she says. &quot;Melenia&apos;s had a dangerous change in its royalty. And I&apos;ve heard things.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Heard what?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just . . . stay aware,&quot; she says. &quot;Watch the East.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Ans then she disappears past the threshold. My hands clasp the Easence Tool as I give three seconds before I chase her again, but without wares to weigh her down, I find she&apos;s already gone.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;&quot;That wasn&apos;t our job! That was stupid and senseless,&quot; Jullian says. He looks at the bare flesh of my arm, scratched enough from rolling on roof stones that it bleeds in a staccato of open cuts. </p><p>&emsp;I can feel his power mend my flesh as we walk back across the abandoned fields, warming the skin and coaxing it to join again.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I thought you&apos;d react differently,&quot; I say, cradling the artifact in my good arm.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I think that was reckless, and you could have gotten yourself killed.&quot; He looks at the ground with the same expression he wore when Cody called him out. &quot;You&apos;re not supposed to do all that hero stuff. You were supposed wait for the real guards.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The real guards? We are real guards,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But not yet.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I ball my fists in my gauntlets. &quot;But how can you say that, after I succeeded at that?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But she got away,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But I recovered the stolen item,&quot; I argue.</p><p>&emsp;He sighs. &quot;Yeah. You did. And no, I guess I&apos;m wrong &mdash; you did something well this time.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This time?&quot; I ask. The cereal grasses crunch beneath our boots for the last span of nature until we reach the scalding hole in the fence.</p><p>&emsp;He tries to take my hand, and I let him, but there&apos;s little energy behind it. He gestures to the huge hole in the wall. &quot;At least your father worked with wood. I hope he taught you enough to fix this mess.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I usher a laugh.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But hey, it&apos;s cool that you got your moment. I wish more people saw it, though &mdash; and not just the homeless that live out there in the ruins.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t do it for the recognition,&quot; I say. &quot;But I hope it helps my case.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sure it will,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;We walk through the same twist of alleyways before returning the item to the shopkeeper at the tent. They add an addendum to my quest form with a page-long note about my efforts, and I enthusiastically fold the pages together, burying them in the pocket of my padded pants.</p><p>&emsp;When we re-emerge in the part of town that hasn&apos;t heard of my recent exploits, Jullian tries to flirt with me, but I feel distant. I look down at my battered hands. I think of the fear inside the eyes of that girl, Aleena, just a year older than I was, so consumed by the thought of life after failure that I feel nothing when Jullian kisses me goodbye at the door, refusing again to stay the night.</p><p>&emsp;A sweet smell greets me when I return. I find a small dessert sitting on a polished plate that&apos;s obviously not from my world.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s a cookie.</p><p>&emsp;And scrawled in neat letters that aren&apos;t from my world either, I find a small note written on a yellow sticky square in dark black ink:</p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>FOR THE BRAVE KNIGHT NEXT DOOR: </span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>I MADE EXTRA. </span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>YOUR TENTATIVE FRIEND.

Giving up is easy, too: but when I feel the weight of the house key in my pocket, trying to estimate how much heavier it was before the first cadet failed their trials, I remember the other choice is death, and it&apos;s a much stronger wind in my sails than whatever storm these troglodytes can throw at me.</p>",

Despite his graze with death, he&apos;s the clearest example of why the Royal Guard juice their soldiers on heavy Essence. &quot;You saved me just in time. The medic said my organs would start shutting down, one by one, if you arrived any later.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.7\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He gets up from the bed in his white hospital gown labeled HARLOWE-B, stretching with a few twists before he approaches. Despite the pallidness of his skin, and the darkened marks on his extremities from where the Chymaeran Curse seized his body, he seems no less capable than any day I&apos;ve seen him before.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.8\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;So why are you still here?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.9\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;The damage is inside, and it will take a while to heal,&quot; Bertram says. &quot;My outside is as handsome as ever, but that assassin did a number on my insides. Said I can&apos;t start training again for another two weeks or so.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.10\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Oh,&quot; I say. I sit at the chair next to the window. Between the gravel lot outside and the brutal concrete walls, it feels more like a prison infirmary than anything else. &quot;I think I&apos;d get sicker just by staying in this room,&quot; I say. &quot;Do you get to walk around outside, at least?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.11\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Not really,&quot; he says. &quot;But thinking of the effort you guys put into saving me, it makes me feel full.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.12\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I smile. &quot;You&apos;re worth it. Plus, I kind of owed you for a while.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.13\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I wish I could have a cool scar like you,&quot; he says, tracing a finger across his face from brow to cheek. &quot;You must be celebrated out there for all that. Have you paid for a single drink at the bar since then?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My smile fades. &quot;It&apos;s easier to talk poorly about people than to praise them. And I choked a little too much.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But a noble is alive because of you!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But the wife won&apos;t forgive me. She made a whole show of it at the town hall before they left. Blamed it all on me, though I didn&apos;t pull the trigger.&quot; I sigh. &quot;But at least Aldrin knows the worth of my efforts.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He rummages under his bed. &quot;Well, it might have been a while ago, but I think I can be the first,&quot; he says. I hear the clatter of glass as he tears through his meager possessions that they let him hold on to. A drawing of the two of us floats across the floor, and I recognize the artistry from my father.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;When was this?&quot; I ask. &quot;And why was it here?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He blushes: the first sign of life I&apos;ve seen on his pallid face as he holds two bottles. &quot;Just remembering the ones that got me through it,&quot; he says, and then he hands me one. &quot;Ryder and Pax and Cae came by last week. They smuggled in a six-pack, so we had four of them. But I saved two for the day you came back.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I laugh, looking around cautiously as I grasp the neck of the bottle. The Essenced heat of my hands heats the metal cap enough for it to expand, popping off with a light thunk, and we cheers over half-a-success and half-a-failure. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.21\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But I can tell something is still on his mind. And after he wets his mouth a couple times with the ale, quickly chugging so we can hide the evidence, he finally speaks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.22\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You know, I thought about some stuff when I was on the edge,&quot; he says, sitting on the left side of the hospital bed in his white gown. &quot;I thought about all the things I hadn&apos;t done yet. That I regretted putting off.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.23\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I understand that fear completely,&quot; I say, as I sit beside him. &quot;The world is so random and chaotic, sometimes it makes you wonder if the Gods stopped watching a long time ago. But you&apos;ve been blessed with more time.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;More time to express my feelings,&quot; he says: a look of hesitation on his face. &quot;In the week I was on the brink of death, I wrote letters in case I didn&apos;t make it. But then I survived. I started healing quickly, and with a second shot, I decided I should go back to the place it all began.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My stomach twists at the thought. &quot;You&apos;ve lived don&apos;t mean&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And not alone,&quot; he says. &quot;I want to go back to the place our lives changed forever. I want to go to Hillfar with you, and I want to tell you something. And that&apos;s why,&quot; he reaches behind his back to retrieve two familiar forms, &quot;I insisted that the guildscribes make it official.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.27\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Going back there. I mean&mdash;&quot; I stammer.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.28\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;If you&apos;re not ready yet, I get it. But I think it would be good for us, and I just wanted you to be aware, so you can prepare yourself.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.29\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I look at the quest form: neatly written in the script of the guildscribes. A high-value, four-star quest, with the purpose written in Bertram&apos;s block script that reads FACING A FORMIDABLE PAST.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.30\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Those days in Hillfar cross my thoughts every day,&quot; I say. &quot;I thought time would dull them, but I still feel like I&apos;m there right now.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; he says, looking down at his own sheet.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.32\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;The quest involves going there. And I feel like I have to fully convince myself I&apos;ve left before I go back.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.33\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Then I&apos;ll be patiently waiting,&quot; he assures me. He reaches to grab my hand. &quot;You&apos;re the strongest person I know.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.34\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I tension his hand in mine on a spark of courage. &quot;But I swear to Khiras that I&apos;ll find it in me before this ends. By the end of this season,&quot; I tell him, &quot;I promise you and I will return.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.35\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Bertram&apos;s smile creases with the dimples he&apos;s had since he was a child, taking my quest form to return it to the folder. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.36\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And if you can do that, then maybe I can find the courage, too,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.37\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;To go there?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.38\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;More than that,&quot; he replies. &quot;But it doesn&apos;t matter yet. It seems you&apos;re the one that will have to be brave first.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.39\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We leave the challenge at that. Another ten minutes pass before we hear the nurses start to make their morning rounds, so I stuff the two bottles in my rucksack neck-up, along with the thick paper doorstop.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.40\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;re going on a local quest with double-L, huh?&quot; Bertram asks, reclining back in his bed as he opens an illustrated book about Blackwater. &quot;He must have had his come-to-Khiras moment about you. Or maybe he feels like he&apos;s in trouble.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.41\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;No&mdash;he just has the first group of friends he&apos;s ever had,&quot; I say. &quot;I want him to enjoy them. Because I know he&apos;ll come back.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.42\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;With an apology, I hope,&quot; Bertram says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.1.43\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I disappear through the door just as the nurse announces his name. The lock clicks in place as I draw my hood, dissolving back between the alleys as morning turns to day.</p>"

        "<p id=\"2.20.2.2\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He takes my hand as we swelter inside the guard tent. I thought an open-air bazaar meant a cooling breeze might flow through every once in a while&mdash;or that the tattered tarp above our heads might block the rays&mdash;but the air scalds our lungs like sitting in a kiln.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.2.3\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He parts his chapped lips, and his eyes trace the floor in the same tick of nervousness he&apos;s had since I met him. But there are still signs we&apos;ve grown together. And when he takes another pull off his second fill of the canteen, his eyes meet mine, and he doesn&apos;t hesitate to speak his mind.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.2.4\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry because I feel like I&apos;ve gotten carried away,&quot; he says. &quot;Away from all the burdens of the old days: days we spent taking care of our siblings when our moms were working to put food on the table, and now that I have the chance to make my first group of friends, it&apos;s like taking off ankle weights. And all I want to do is run.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.2.5\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;As long as you don&apos;t run away,&quot; I say. I tension my sweaty fingers in his, and he returns my strength. &quot;You should have fun during this please. We should both enjoy it: we gave so much of our lives to be here.&quot;</p>",

For my siblings, my family&mdash;almost like a good childhood skipped me&mdash;and I was forced to give it all away to the ones that came after. And now,&quot; he says, &quot;I have this freedom I&apos;ve never had before, and I don&apos;t know what to do with it. And any time I wake up sitting there, just standing still, I feel like I&apos;m spending the last seconds of my youth before I get too old to live it, just full of regret.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.2.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But you weren&apos;t there,&quot; I tell him. He struggles to look at me, but I can sense the pain of loneliness no different than mine. &quot;Why didn&apos;t you stand up for me, or at least come to visit in the days after the attempt on that noble&apos;s life? Were you . . . ashamed of me?&quot; I remember when he couldn&apos;t even return my gaze when we entered the hall with Bertram. It might have been the first event that precipitated this long spiral.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.2.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I had a moment of weakness,&quot; he says. &quot;I should have been there, but every second I wasn&apos;t, this guilt just kept getting greater and greater, until the point that I was afraid of facing you. That you&apos;d think I deserted you.&quot;</p>",

His gauntlets grasp the side of my head, tracing his thumb on my cheek. &quot;I&apos;ve always hated this weakness I&apos;ve felt my entire life. This cowardice, of a boy that never made friends, made fun of, and was so scared and unchallenged that he never tried to fly.&quot; He tears up a little. &quot;And I guess I&apos;ve taken for granted the one thing I&apos;ve thought I would always have, supporting me through it all. You,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.2.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The anger and sorrow mix at just a level that I feel them rest at a stalemate. &quot;I want to be there for you, Jullian. But I need you to try, just try, to be there for me. And to stay,&quot; I tell him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.2.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I tension my arms around his waist, ducking my head beneath his neck as he buries his head into my hair. I mumble something into his chestplate that he doesn&apos;t hear.</p>",

The panic makes me hold fast to the metal contact: siphoning the friction of the Essence into my circuits in a rejuvenating reversal.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.2\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The energy cycles through my body from my arms to my legs, and though my blood freezes with the initial surge of panic, my circuits are scalding with power. The vibrations in the tether rattle the bones in my arms, casting sparks of hot iron, and when I&apos;m close enough to drop and run, I use the force of the fall to dig the toe of my boots between cobblestones. And with all the energy I&apos;ve stored from letting the blood pool in my legs for four hours&mdash;sitting in tight, padded pants&mdash;all I want to do is run.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.3\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The stones shift their alignment when my boots break the ground.

While I waste momentum weaving around civilians, they cut straight through them&mdash;but still, they&apos;re uncommonly quick for a human, and it&apos;s when the wind sheds their disguise that I see the cat ears. Long locks of black hair trail behind them, and in the absence of short fur, it means they&apos;re a half-blood, dipping into their gift of Ahkvan Essence to accelerate time around them.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.5\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I vault over the table of a turquoise tent where Kine changes hands. Now the thief is right ahead of me, and instead of shouting, I save my breath to run faster. Time dilates ever-so-slightly around them, casting their shaded features in blue, but I wager that their abilities are nothing compared to my compass.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.20.3.8\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The edge of the district is coming near, where a long wooden fence partitions the district from all the abandoned spaces. The assailant takes their time to amble over the edge with the Essenced artifact, and by the time their feet land on the other side, I charge my Essence enough to directly blast myself straight through the wood, casting charred chips of timber toward the abandoned buildings, knowing I&apos;ll be paying for it later with another domestic quest.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.9\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I can see them clearer now that we&apos;re neck-and-neck, and I recognize the tattered cloak looks familiar as it billows behind her. Three steps behind, we approach the old castle shed, separated from the grounds of the Estate. To a layman, it would be a dead end&mdash;but for someone with knowledge of the Royal Guards&mdash;it&apos;s an ancient egress point, and when she enters the small storeroom lined with aged tools from centuries ago, she knows to slip beneath the busted trapdoor to drop down into the ancient tunnels.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.10\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;If only I had this much adrenaline during the parade, maybe the outcome would be different, because from all the energy coursing through my circuits and veins, I don&apos;t think twice about dropping down into the old escape tunnels. Her boots splash in the murky water, crunching the bones of forgotten skeletons that fought the front lines  five hundred years ago. When I land in the calf-high sludge, I cast a plume of fire that bounces between the walls, lighting the lines of the long earthen tomb until it sizzles in the water, just long enough to see her silhouette shrink down the straightaway.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.20.3.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I find the energy to yell. &quot;You&apos;re not getting away from me,&quot; I shout, and when we break the threshold of the courtyard, we find drifters and vagrants making camp with tattered sheets, stoking fires with their meager Essence. She scales the stairs of the main edifice, and I wonder why she gains height when it only means she&apos;s getting further from the ground.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I&apos;m close enough now that I can feel the wind she displaces. She grabs for a steaming pot and launches it at me, casting a spray of boiling soup, but I duck out of the way, regathering my footing as she tries throwing down debris to trip me.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But she wasted too much on the offense. I grab her cloak as we crest the stairs of the old hall, so crumbled from war and the elements that sunlight streams through the ceiling and walls.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Enough,&quot; I shout.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But she tears out a shortsword with her other hand, slicing through the fabric as I stumble. With the Essence Tool still cradled in her arm, she draws her weapon to face me. I drop the scrap of fabric, realizing from touch that it&apos;s a guard cloak.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Her sharp blue eyes catch the trainee insignia on my armor, along with my identifying number. &quot;A replacement,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We circle around a table. &quot;You stole that cloak from a guard,&quot; I say, as I draw my sword. &quot;Reinforcements are right behind me. You have nowhere to go!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.21\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re as disposable as I was,&quot; she says. &quot;Your number. Starting with eighty-four means they have you in the house with the lake view.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.22\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;How could you know that?&quot; I ask, but I don&apos;t let her mind games shake me.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.23\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Because your name is coming off that damn key just like mine was, and you&apos;ll have nothing,&quot; she shouts, ripping the table aside as she takes her first swing at me.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We trade blows, fighting in a hall that the old Knights once trained in, clashing our swords with echoes of an ancient past. I remember Derry, the baker, and a name that crests my lips as I try to remember.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Our circling runs me into the edge of a table, and unable to evade, she drives at me with a powerful blow, buffeting me with the Essence Tool. I stumble, nearly dropping my sword as she slices across my breastplate, catching metal instead of flesh.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Aleena,&quot; I say. &quot;Why do you do this?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.27\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;She pauses for a moment, as if she&apos;d really give an answer. But then she runs for the spiral staircase to the upper floors, and I give chase, just as I hear the other lagging guards approach the hall.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.28\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I take two steps at a time, casting sparks as my steel pauldtons scrape the side of the stairwell. I can hear her footfalls directly above me as we get higher and higher and higher, until we reach the very top. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.29\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;She&apos;s running out of avenues to escape. All that&apos;s left are the buildings of the old industrial district that border the castle, and when we&apos;re four stories up, running across ramparts that look out to a stark cliffside bordering the forest, I doubt she has anywhere to go.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.30\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But then she jumps onto a roof of a wooden building in the servants&apos; quarter. She yelps when her foot crashes through the ceiling, withdrawing as I decide to approach from the other side, aiming for the central beam id the frame instead of the eaves.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We&apos;re neck-and-neck as she lumbers with the stolen tool and I struggle with my armor, not quite in grabbing distance when the fall is too much of a consequence. She&apos;s heading for the other side of the castle rampart bordering the industrial warehouses, and when I think I&apos;m about to grab her, she channels all her Essence into accelerating for one final sprint.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.32\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My breath tastes like poison when it leaves my lungs. Falling further behind, I watch as she runs directly for the edge of the castle wall, as if to jump to her death. But without hesitation, she clambers onto a straightaway of stone slabs, managing seven strides before she launches herself over the edge.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.33\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;She vanishes from sight. And I wager she&apos;s planned this all from the start: planning to live and steal another day, so before the hesitation seizes my muscles, I take the same seven steps and launch myself over the edge.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.34\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I can feel the turbulence of wind as gravity comes to collect on my four-story climb. Behind me, I hear Jullian cry my name, and beneath me, a yawning gap spans a thousand years of progress between the old castle and the tall industrial building.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.35\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We float in the air at the same time, flying like the Auvryan angels of their floating lands. Her Ahkvan reflexes give her just shy of nine lives to land. I hinge my legs in anticipation of crashing into the gravel roof, and after she rolls off her fall, I thrust myself with a plume of flames to break my speed enough to twist myself into a barrel roll.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.36\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The roof is small, high, and flat, surrounded by the stark eaves of industrial buildings that are unnavigable. Out of breath, she rushes for the roof access door, only to find it locked, desperately jimmying the round handle as she groans in exasperation.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.37\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Drop it,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.38\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;She complies, placing the artifact on the ground. &quot;As soon as I failed that test, I was always destined to die. So do whatever you have to do with me.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.39\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I quickly glance to the edge of the castle wall, so much higher than I remember. All the guards descended the stairs, running around to reconvene inside the warehouse. And I make a decision. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.40\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I reach past her, tensioning my fingers against the knob as it glows with scalding heat.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.41\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What are you doing? But aren&apos;t you going to take me in? I&apos;m a part of the Den Of Thieves now!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.42\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You and I aren&apos;t that different. Just separated by time, I fear.&quot; I gesture for the door. &quot;She got away. But she dropped the high-value tool she might have used to aid the enemy.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.43\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;A look of shameful relief flushes her face. Sweat mixes with tears she refuses to allow to break the threshold of her eyes. &quot;I never wanted it to end up this way,&quot; she says. &quot;Aren&apos;t you afraid they&apos;ll send you to die? And then what will you do?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.44\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I tell her. &quot;But you can choose something else.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.45\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;She makes for the stairway as I hear a dozen footfalls reach the gravel lot below. Then she hesitates. &quot;There&apos;s something brewing from the East, I hear,&quot; she says. &quot;Melenia&apos;s had a dangerous change in its royalty. And I&apos;ve heard things.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.46\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Heard what?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.47\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Just . . . stay aware,&quot; she says. &quot;Watch the East.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.3.48\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Ans then she disappears past the threshold. My hands clasp the Easence Tool as I give three seconds before I chase her again, but without wares to weigh her down, I find she&apos;s already gone.</p>"

      [
        "<p id=\"2.20.4.1\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;That wasn&apos;t our job! That was stupid and senseless,&quot; Jullian says. He looks at the bare flesh of my arm, scratched enough from rolling on roof stones that it bleeds in a staccato of open cuts. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.4.2\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I can feel his power mend my flesh as we walk back across the abandoned fields, warming the skin and coaxing it to join again.</p>",

You were supposed wait for the real guards.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.20.4.11\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;This time?&quot; I ask. The cereal grasses crunch beneath our boots for the last span of nature until we reach the scalding hole in the fence.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.4.12\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He tries to take my hand, and I let him, but there&apos;s little energy behind it. He gestures to the huge hole in the wall. &quot;At least your father worked with wood. I hope he taught you enough to fix this mess.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.4.13\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I usher a laugh.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.4.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But hey, it&apos;s cool that you got your moment. I wish more people saw it, though &mdash; and not just the homeless that live out there in the ruins.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.4.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t do it for the recognition,&quot; I say. &quot;But I hope it helps my case.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.20.4.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We walk through the same twist of alleyways before returning the item to the shopkeeper at the tent. They add an addendum to my quest form with a page-long note about my efforts, and I enthusiastically fold the pages together, burying them in the pocket of my padded pants.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.4.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;When we re-emerge in the part of town that hasn&apos;t heard of my recent exploits, Jullian tries to flirt with me, but I feel distant. I look down at my battered hands. I think of the fear inside the eyes of that girl, Aleena, just a year older than I was, so consumed by the thought of life after failure that I feel nothing when Jullian kisses me goodbye at the door, refusing again to stay the night.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.20.4.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;A sweet smell greets me when I return. I find a small dessert sitting on a polished plate that&apos;s obviously not from my world.</p>",

      "<p>&emsp;It came scrawled in messy letters that weren&apos;t from my world, written on a piece of vellum fresh with ink. It was only four words that would send a chill down any man&apos;s spine: especially if they came smaller on the screen of a smartphone.</p><p><span class=KatiyaHand msgnote>Cody:</span></p><p><span class=KatiyaHand msgnote>We need to talk.</span></p><p><span class=KatiyaHand msgnote>- Katiya</span></p><p>&emsp;But it came with a plate that wasn&apos;t from my world, like some kind of antique I&apos;d find at my grandmother&apos;s house, with a hot-cross bun that tasted fresher than anything I&apos;d find at the Sunday farmer&apos;s market.</p><p>&emsp;But she wasn&apos;t mad at least, I thought. And I was right. She was asking me a favor, because she volunteered me for something I never asked to do, because she considered me weak enough to fill the role.</p><p>&emsp;And after I strolled around her town to size me for clothes that wouldn&apos;t make me stand out too much, I find myself now standing in an open lot with loads of other townsfolk, arranged in a laughable formation, feeling like I&apos;m at a little-league lacrosse practice if all the dads were swapped out for the kids.</p><p>&emsp;The Royal Guards line the dirt-and-grass lot with sheathed swords. We all face the most important guy, standing at the front as he tries not to laugh at the sorry arrangement of rejects that are only here for the free beer after the event. But at least it&apos;s for a good cause. And she volun-told me in advance early enough that I could take paid time off.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Gentlemen, I&apos;m honored to gather you all here today,&quot; Katiya&apos;s commander says. &quot;Though our guards are powerful and skilled enough to defend all of Gaffesend, this a chance for you to develop the tools to defend yourselves. To feel comfortable and safe.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The only time I remember doing anything like this was at some other kid&apos;s karate party when I was in first grade. And the instructor had to break the balsa wood plank with his own hands, because I was afraid of hurting myself. I look down at the wooden training sword, hoping it&apos;s just an odd prop for one of those weird stretching exercises.</p><p>&emsp;I feel a hand on my shoulder. A stocky man whispers in my ear. &quot;So Katiya roped you into this too, huh? To get her two?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess so,&quot; I say. &quot;My hands are soft: I design stuff all day.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;m a baker. Name&apos;s Derry,&quot; he says, and I shake his large, calloused hand without turning around&mdash;too afraid of getting yelled at, though the three rows of husky townies hide me well. &quot;What part of town are you in?&quot; I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen you around.</p><p>&emsp;My nervousness impedes my filter. &quot;I live with Katiya,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;With her?&quot; He asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. No . . . I mean, close to her. Next to her,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. So what do you do for the military then?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My mind races back on Katiya&apos;s collection of rehearsed lies. &quot;I&apos;m one of the Royal Scientists&apos; prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, so they wedged me in with the others, doing some research in Gaffesend.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well I don&apos;t blame you for being close to Katiya. If I was thirty years younger, with a body like that, I&apos;d fight a damn war for a woman like her,&quot; he says, reminding me of most of the technicians at my work. But the commander&apos;s voice cuts us off, before Derry can objectify her any further.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Most of you are too, uh . . . &apos;heavy-set&apos; for running, so today will focus on basic, self-defense sword fighting and feats of strength.&quot; I flex and feel for the strength in my arms, hoping my two-a-week workouts give me enough muscle to overpower an Essenced tavern-brawler. He continues: &quot;While our brave, senior soldiers guard the borders of Gaffesend, this is a chance for our trainees to pass on their knowledge.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I look to Katiya, flushed with that same sense of anxiety that seems like her factory setting. She musters a smile when we meet eyes, standing next to her beanpole boyfriend with their swords drawn, and as Aldrin rambles on about the value of self-defense like a first-amendment technician at my work, I twirl the wooden training sword in the dirt.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So we&apos;ll start with basic technique. I&apos;m sure most of you have at least been trained a little &mdash; maybe by a family member or something.&quot; I remember playing defense in Lacrosse, jabbing breastplates with the basket end of my stick, and that&apos;s about it: besides shooting clays with my godfather in the FBI &mdash; but that&apos;s at least a hundred years away for these people.</p><p>&emsp;He shows us a basic downward swing before instructing us to stand further apart. I try a couple swings like all the others, without a single idea of what I&apos;m doing, and when the other cadets start to approach, I catch Katiya laughing at me.</p><p>&emsp;I flip her the bird, hoping sign language crosses our understandings: catching a glare from Jullian as he approaches to help his own two volunteers.</p><p>&emsp;Katiya says, &quot;The point is to swing through something. Don&apos;t stop short!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But there&apos;s nothing to swing at,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then swing at me,&quot; she says. I recall my father&apos;s words about hitting a girl. And then she adds: &quot;You&apos;ve already done it once before, haven&apos;t you? So what&apos;s the difference?&quot; Her lips peel into a mischievous smile, ready to hurl as many insults as it takes for me to go all out.</p><p>&emsp;Derry hands Katiya his wooden sword to add some fuel. &quot;She&apos;s one of the tough ones. I bet you won&apos;t last a minute.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;And with enough pressure, I chance a light swing at her. She slashes with half her power, nearly knocking the training sword out of my hands.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve seen toddlers with less hesitation,&quot; she says. She swings the sword a couple times to draw the attention of other townies, adding pressure for me to defend my manhood. They turn their heads. &quot;Come on: do your worst, Cody of Denver!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I white-knuckle the hilt of the sword like a baseball bat, taking a hard swing from the side. Katiya hardly twists her sword, and my blade glides up the polished flat surface.</p><p>&emsp;My momentum shifts entirely upright as I continue to spin, so committed to the strike that the training blade launches out of my hands. It travels point-first as it spins in the air like a surface-to-air missile with guards for fins, launching towards the commander as he recognizes all the turning faces.</p><p>&emsp;My muscles crumple faster than my soul as I watch Katiya&apos;s face change from humor to horror. Aldrin raises his arm in an instant, catching the smooth edge with a single hand. The edgeless blade slides for its full length before stopping at the hilt, the dull point halted inches from his face.</p><p>&emsp;He looks around at all the startled townsfolk, astounded at how quickly this training session descended into disarray. Once he traces the trajectory, the scarred commander stares daggers at me as he approaches from the center of the field. Dealing with my varsity coach was hard enough when I whipped that hard rubber lacrosse ball past his head: I&apos;ve never pissed off a warrior like him.</p><p>&emsp;He doesn&apos;t even have to open his mouth before I&apos;m off in apologetics. He draws the sword so it points directly at my chest.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I, uh, do numbers and stuff. I&apos;m not any kind of warrior,&quot; I insist.</p><p>&emsp;But Katiya cuts in. &quot;It was my fault, Chief. I egged him on by insulting him a little. I wanted to see him angry.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I think he&apos;s going to skewer me and roast my flesh over a spit, but he flips the blade around in his hands so that the hilt faces me. &quot;What&apos;s your name, son?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The townsfolk look on with secondhand shame. Aldrin turns to around to shoo their focus away, and by the time I answer, they&apos;ve all returned to practicing techniques.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody. Well, you have the passion,&quot; he says. &quot;And a strong arm. But you need to channel that into technique.&quot; He gestures to Katiya for her wooden sword. &quot;Is it alright if I borrow your volunteer?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Katiya nods.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The most important thing in sword fighting is balance, Mister Cody,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;You put all your power into a single swing &mdash; but what were you planning to do after?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I stammer as the weight of the sword in my hands becomes awkward. &quot;I . . . I&apos;m not sure,&quot; I say, &quot;sir.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t be ashamed, son. You&apos;ve done the Gods&apos; work coming out today as a volunteer, and I&apos;m grateful you&apos;re here. But Miss Katiya, here, is a true professional.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;And it feels like a lion training a chihuahua.</p><p>&emsp;Aldrin turns to Katiya. &quot;Why don&apos;t you show Mr. Cody a standard forward strike?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We stand aside. Katiya balances her feet so that her non-dominant foot is in front, with her hips facing forward. The steel sword slides out of her sheath with an iconic ring.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And, see, her goal is to close the gap between herself and the enemy with the blade,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;But notice there, how she steps away slightly?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say, transfixed at her training. She slashes forward with a perfect overhead swing, but steps slightly to the side with her dominant foot.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And why don&apos;t you explain how this ties into balance, Katiya?&quot; Aldrin asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The line of action goes directly at the enemy. But I step aside, in case there&apos;s a counterattack. It lets you keep your balance,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;Aldrin claps me on the back, handing me the training sword. &quot;Why don&apos;t you give it a shot?&quot; He asks.</p><p>&emsp;I draw my left foot forward, as if I&apos;m beaming a lacrosse ball across the field for a breakaway. But I get confused with my footing.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why don&apos;t you practice with him, Katiya? Hold the sword with him.&quot; But then her face flushes. &quot;Don&apos;t be embarrassed. Mister Dunsmore needs to learn,&quot; he says, smiling as he withdraws.</p><p>&emsp;Katiya hesitantly approaches from behind me. I feel the cold steel of her breastplate press against my back as she reaches her gauntlets to grasp my hands, and I refuse to even try looking at Jullian. Her steel boots align with my feet as I stand off-foot-forward, and as I slice down with the wooden sword, her hips press into mine, guiding my legs to swing in rhythm with the sword, and I end up to the side of that perfect line of action.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t get used to it,&quot; she whispers in my ear, and I swear I can feel the heat radiate off her face.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Very good,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;Now give me a hundred of those: now!&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I tense in tonal panic, locked with the sword in its last position. </p><p>&emsp;Aldrin laughs. &quot;Sorry. Force of habit. Do, uh . . . twenty or something, yeah?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sir, yes sir,&quot; I say, as if I&apos;m a pledge in the fraternity again.</p><p>&emsp;I take a couple practice swings, mirroring Katiya&apos;s technique as best as I can. And as Derry steps to the side&mdash;relieved he doesn&apos;t have to leverage his husky frame for sword practice, ever closer to the free ale on the other side of the session, Katiya takes at least ten minutes before she can turn and face me again.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp; &quot;If you&apos;re on the line right now, you don&apos;t mind the chance of getting hurt,&quot; Aldrin says. His eyes scan the thirsty townies standing behind the line of rope. &quot;Just because you don&apos;t get to drink first if you don&apos;t do the course does NOT mean you won&apos;t drink at all.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But all the fucking ale will be gone!&quot; One of the beer-gutted strongmen says. Even the hesitant men now join the line, shouting in agreement.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, it&apos;s not a race: it&apos;s a course,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;And you need to help each other.&quot; He gestures around the standard training course used by the Royal Guards, bent in a U-shape that ends with kegs and kegs of booze. Some men look like they&apos;re about to cut the whole damn course, but the senior guards are back &mdash; and Aldrin set them up so no one can cut the others. I can&apos;t see the course behind the backs of the tall and muscular farmers and their field hands. I&apos;ll have to play it entirely by ear.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Your trainees are depending on you to win, because they don&apos;t drink until your whole team does. So they&apos;ll be cheering you on, all along the way,&quot; Aldrin says.</p><p>&emsp;I can feel the adrenaline coarse through my veins, but mostly from the fear of getting crushed or stepped on. </p><p>&emsp;Derry&apos;s hand rests on my shoulder. &quot;You&apos;re a young fella, and fast, I bet. You&apos;ll be able to shoot right through there!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;If they let me,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll make them,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;Aldrin counts down. Even for a fun run, I can feel the pressure mount on me as Katiya watches&mdash;and every time we meet eyes, I feel the urge build to impress her.</p><p>&emsp;He holds an archaic gun into the air. I hold my breath, waiting for the blast like it&apos;s winter track season all over again. I stagger my feet and let my fingers soak into the cold, wet soil, and just as I&apos;m about to anticipate the blast, I feel Derry&apos;s hands grasp my back.</p><p>&emsp;The gun blast echoes between the mountains. Derry pushes me with all his strength, and suddenly I stagger into first: sliding a quarter-distance of the mud pit beneath the barbed wire.</p><p>&emsp;I was a three-sport athlete, and I immediately think back to football season in the fall, when snow still saturated the frozen ground, and I&apos;m lighter than I was then when I wore pads and a helmet. Lighter than the ones before me, my elbows thrash the ground as mud splashes in my face, peerless in the moment, absorbed in the cheers that crescendo with my name.</p><p>&emsp;My old-world shirt is soaked in heavy mud, and I&apos;m drenched down to the Under Armor compression shirt, but I feel that rare window of joy seize my body in its entirety, and I&apos;m thankful my emotional curse doesn&apos;t eclipse my enjoyment of the moment. I hear the sloshing and clambering of men that look like Vikings, grunting and growling with their lust of liquor.</p><p>&emsp;I rise at the end of the mud crawl, glancing back to find my teammate Derry not far behind: his wife cheering him on from the sidelines. I hear Katiya shout my name, and turn to face the next obstacle: a tall climbing wall with several ropes hanging from the top. I&apos;m not as light as I was after a whole four years of shotgunning beers in the fraternity, but it feels as if I have circuits like Katiya, from all the energy that floods my veins.</p><p>&emsp;My hands grasp the ragged weave of rope, tucking it beneath my arm as I take the first steps up the wall. The eyes are all on me now as I compensate for my previous failure. My arms grab hand-over-hand as the mud-soaked townies clamber like zombies, with groans that lust for liquor instead of brains, shaking the rope as they grasp it themselves, destabilizing my footing on the wall.</p><p>&emsp;But I tighten my hands on the rope. Past halfway, I find it stretches less, advantaged by the boost from Derry that left the rope loose for much of my ascent. And as I approach the top, I feel my stomach drop when I look at the other side.</p><p>&emsp;I thought it was another rope down. But instead, I find three logs spanning a two-story-high stretch from one tower to another: the bottom filled with murky, freezing water of an unknown depth. The adrenaline outpaces the panic as the crowd of knights and supporters shifts up to watch as I take my first steps on the log: tempted to hug and hump my way across, but I take a deep breath and take my time.</p><p>&emsp;So far down, Katiya and Jullian stand beside each other, along with Pax and Ryder and the catgirl Cae and a pale-looking Bertram that shakes his fist.</p><p>&emsp;I scrape my muddy feet before I proceed: still a ways ahead of the others, and I take my time stepping across&mdash;like an alcoholic walking a line to show an officer that he can drive.</p><p>&emsp;But I catch an odd footing. Panic seizes my chest when the elevation imposes itself, and I fall to my chest as the crowd groans in anticipation. But I hear their cheers still coming strong: Pax chanting &quot;Science Guy&quot; in their tongue until the others join, and they cheer when I regain my footing, stumbling slowly before I make it to the other side.</p><p>&emsp;Next is a span of sixteen-or-so bars dangling over the same sickening drop. I doubt my adrenaline will last if I don&apos;t keep going: un-Essenced like the others and at a certain disadvantage.</p><p>&emsp;But I continue: taking the first suspended bar in my hands as my feet decide whether they want to leave the safety of the platform, making the mistake of looking down and noticing patches of grass I HOPE are just floating, and not islands that would break my legs.</p><p>&emsp;But the excitement is too great. My exhilarated mind flashes back to the breakaways of all those lacrosse games I miss so damn much with Miguel&mdash;and lost in the emotional rhyme, I realize I&apos;m already halfway across, steadily swinging between rails until I make it to the other side.</p><p>&emsp;I turn back to find Derry waving at the other side, making some gesture I interpret as a &quot;thumbs-up&quot; as he waits to cross, using his meager townie Essence to strengthen his grasp before it&apos;s his turn to cross the bars.</p><p>&emsp;The end of the towers is a series of vertical ropes. And as the others gain on me with their powerful arms, swinging like silverback gorillas, I slide down the rope after saturating my hands in the cool mud caked on my undershirt, regaining my footing as I make it to the bottom.</p><p>&emsp;I reach the end of the &apos;U&apos;-shape to find the joining section as a simple sprint before more low-level towers at ground height, and I take off for the next side, watching as the Essenced knights double my speed to get a spot on the other side.</p><p>&emsp;I feel a presence behind me. One of Jullian&apos;s non-guard buddies I recognize from before uses his advantage to sprint faster, and he&apos;s several breaths behind me as we round the last turn of the U-shape, coming to a near stop as we approach a bunch of logs that protrude from a gravel pit: a series of one-footed jumps that focus on technique over strength.</p><p>&emsp;Half cheer my name. But half cheer for my adversary, named Delvin. We balance the desire for speed over the failure of the fall, wagering the swiftness of every jump. And as we&apos;re neck-and-neck, I decide to dash the rest of the logs, back in first as I make it to the last challenge.</p><p>&emsp;All that&apos;s left is one last straightaway with hurdles. It was my event in track when I was lighter, and had a six-pack on my body instead of in my hand every weekend. But the muscle memory is there, and as I take lane two of six, my rival takes four as we sprint with all we have, letting the fanfare flood our muscles where our exasperated breath falls short.</p><p>&emsp;My steps reach a rhythm like I&apos;m sprinting down the hundred-meter span of hurdles on my high school track: over the long logs in seven steps and a leap, seven steps and a leap, seven steps and a leap.</p><p>&emsp;The goal is getting closer, stacked with kegs. The beautiful town ladies are tensioned with corsets that rise their breasts as a beckoning call to the grizzly men behind us, raising mugs of fresh ale as sirens that call their lascivious warriors to come.</p><p>&emsp;A leap and seven steps. A leap and seven steps. And I see Katiya at the finish, smiling ear-to-ear as her boyfriend stands next to her, cheering on Delvin. And I&apos;m so close now, about to place first, when I hear a pained groan and a loud exhale as Delvin crumples into the second-to-last log hurdle.</p><p>&emsp;And I stop in my tracks, inches from the finish. I look behind me to find Delvin grasping his chest without wind as the horde of others is quickly approaching.</p><p>&emsp;But I decide to turn around as I huff for breath, climbing over the log to approach my rival, offering him a hand so he can rise from the sullen ground.</p><p>&emsp;I take his arm across my shoulders. A few racers sprint past us, transfixed by the boobs and ale ahead of them. And as we stumble over the logs in steps instead of leaps, I feel Delvin&apos;s weight shift when Derry grabs his other arm.</p><p>&emsp;We finish twelfth-or-so. Katiya and all her friends congratulate the three of us when we cross. The air stinks of salty sweat, but the ale is sweet and savory as we chug the carbonated brew like cold water.</p><p>&emsp;We hang around for a while until Aldrin presents an award to first place, and though he recognizes my efforts, he presents it to another lean, younger man that passed us while we carried Delvin. Katiya and a few friends watch my face as I react to this loss, and though Delvin is distraught, I laugh and cheer as the winner holds his makeshift trophy in the air.</p><p>&emsp;I find an emotion in Katiya&apos;s face that I&apos;ve never seen before. She looks away when I return her glance. Her other friends chatter on about how I deserve the title, and even Jullian offers me words of encouragement, thanking me for aiding his friend.</p><p>&emsp;A long day ends with us walking home. I say I left my stuff at Katiya&apos;s so we could all walk together, and when they&apos;re all distracted, I slip inside and disappear through the door&mdash;quick to feel the bliss of a hot shower.</p><p>&emsp;After toweling off, I head downstairs to grab a glass of water in my boxers. I hear Jullian and Katiya heading upstairs on their side of the dimensional wall. Katiya whispers something to Jullian as he continues to climb the stairs, and after she takes off her heavy boots, I hear her footfalls as she approaches my door.</p><p>&emsp;She knocks with a knuckle. I&apos;m quick to answer on the other side, peeking out no more than my head and a shoulder.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey &mdash; thanks for doing this today,&quot; she whispers. &quot;You surely didn&apos;t start off so well, but you ended in a blaze.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; I tell her. &quot;It was worth the PTO.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She turns to close the door, but then hesitates for a moment: something still on her mind that she&apos;s tempted to ask. &quot;But at the end there . . . you were surely going to win,&quot; she says. &quot;Why did you give Delvin a hand before you crossed?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She looks up with anticipation, as if she disbelieves the face I wore when they were handing out awards. But something makes her want to hear me say it: to convince her of something.</p><p>&emsp;And so I tell her the truth.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just didn&apos;t think the ale would taste any different,&quot; I whisper. &quot;You know?&quot;</p>"

        "<p id=\"2.21.1.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My nervousness impedes my filter. &quot;I live with Katiya,&quot; I say.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.21.1.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I look to Katiya, flushed with that same sense of anxiety that seems like her factory setting.

        "<p id=\"2.21.1.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;So we&apos;ll start with basic technique. I&apos;m sure most of you have at least been trained a little &mdash; maybe by a family member or something.&quot; I remember playing defense in Lacrosse, jabbing breastplates with the basket end of my stick, and that&apos;s about it: besides shooting clays with my godfather in the FBI &mdash; but that&apos;s at least a hundred years away for these people.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.21.1.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I flip her the bird, hoping sign language crosses our understandings: catching a glare from Jullian as he approaches to help his own two volunteers.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Katiya says, &quot;The point is to swing through something. Don&apos;t stop short!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But there&apos;s nothing to swing at,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Then swing at me,&quot; she says. I recall my father&apos;s words about hitting a girl. And then she adds: &quot;You&apos;ve already done it once before, haven&apos;t you? So what&apos;s the difference?&quot; Her lips peel into a mischievous smile, ready to hurl as many insults as it takes for me to go all out.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Derry hands Katiya his wooden sword to add some fuel. &quot;She&apos;s one of the tough ones. I bet you won&apos;t last a minute.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;And with enough pressure, I chance a light swing at her. She slashes with half her power, nearly knocking the training sword out of my hands.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve seen toddlers with less hesitation,&quot; she says. She swings the sword a couple times to draw the attention of other townies, adding pressure for me to defend my manhood. They turn their heads. &quot;Come on: do your worst, Cody of Denver!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I white-knuckle the hilt of the sword like a baseball bat, taking a hard swing from the side. Katiya hardly twists her sword, and my blade glides up the polished flat surface.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My momentum shifts entirely upright as I continue to spin, so committed to the strike that the training blade launches out of my hands. It travels point-first as it spins in the air like a surface-to-air missile with guards for fins, launching towards the commander as he recognizes all the turning faces.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My muscles crumple faster than my soul as I watch Katiya&apos;s face change from humor to horror. Aldrin raises his arm in an instant, catching the smooth edge with a single hand. The edgeless blade slides for its full length before stopping at the hilt, the dull point halted inches from his face.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.34\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He looks around at all the startled townsfolk, astounded at how quickly this training session descended into disarray. Once he traces the trajectory, the scarred commander stares daggers at me as he approaches from the center of the field. Dealing with my varsity coach was hard enough when I whipped that hard rubber lacrosse ball past his head: I&apos;ve never pissed off a warrior like him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.35\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He doesn&apos;t even have to open his mouth before I&apos;m off in apologetics. He draws the sword so it points directly at my chest.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.36\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I, uh, do numbers and stuff. I&apos;m not any kind of warrior,&quot; I insist.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.37\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But Katiya cuts in. &quot;It was my fault, Chief. I egged him on by insulting him a little. I wanted to see him angry.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.38\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I think he&apos;s going to skewer me and roast my flesh over a spit, but he flips the blade around in his hands so that the hilt faces me. &quot;What&apos;s your name, son?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.39\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The townsfolk look on with secondhand shame. Aldrin turns to around to shoo their focus away, and by the time I answer, they&apos;ve all returned to practicing techniques.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.40\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Cody. Well, you have the passion,&quot; he says. &quot;And a strong arm. But you need to channel that into technique.&quot; He gestures to Katiya for her wooden sword. &quot;Is it alright if I borrow your volunteer?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.41\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Katiya nods.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.42\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;The most important thing in sword fighting is balance, Mister Cody,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;You put all your power into a single swing &mdash; but what were you planning to do after?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.43\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I stammer as the weight of the sword in my hands becomes awkward. &quot;I . . . I&apos;m not sure,&quot; I say, &quot;sir.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.44\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t be ashamed, son. You&apos;ve done the Gods&apos; work coming out today as a volunteer, and I&apos;m grateful you&apos;re here. But Miss Katiya, here, is a true professional.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.45\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;And it feels like a lion training a chihuahua.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.46\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Aldrin turns to Katiya. &quot;Why don&apos;t you show Mr. Cody a standard forward strike?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.47\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;We stand aside. Katiya balances her feet so that her non-dominant foot is in front, with her hips facing forward. The steel sword slides out of her sheath with an iconic ring.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.48\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;And, see, her goal is to close the gap between herself and the enemy with the blade,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;But notice there, how she steps away slightly?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.49\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say, transfixed at her training. She slashes forward with a perfect overhead swing, but steps slightly to the side with her dominant foot.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.50\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;And why don&apos;t you explain how this ties into balance, Katiya?&quot; Aldrin asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.51\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;The line of action goes directly at the enemy. But I step aside, in case there&apos;s a counterattack. It lets you keep your balance,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.52\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Aldrin claps me on the back, handing me the training sword. &quot;Why don&apos;t you give it a shot?&quot; He asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.53\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I draw my left foot forward, as if I&apos;m beaming a lacrosse ball across the field for a breakaway. But I get confused with my footing.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.54\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Why don&apos;t you practice with him, Katiya? Hold the sword with him.&quot; But then her face flushes. &quot;Don&apos;t be embarrassed. Mister Dunsmore needs to learn,&quot; he says, smiling as he withdraws.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.55\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Katiya hesitantly approaches from behind me. I feel the cold steel of her breastplate press against my back as she reaches her gauntlets to grasp my hands, and I refuse to even try looking at Jullian. Her steel boots align with my feet as I stand off-foot-forward, and as I slice down with the wooden sword, her hips press into mine, guiding my legs to swing in rhythm with the sword, and I end up to the side of that perfect line of action.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.56\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t get used to it,&quot; she whispers in my ear, and I swear I can feel the heat radiate off her face.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.57\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Very good,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;Now give me a hundred of those: now!&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.58\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I tense in tonal panic, locked with the sword in its last position. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.59\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Aldrin laughs. &quot;Sorry. Force of habit. Do, uh . . . twenty or something, yeah?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.60\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Sir, yes sir,&quot; I say, as if I&apos;m a pledge in the fraternity again.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.1.61\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I take a couple practice swings, mirroring Katiya&apos;s technique as best as I can. And as Derry steps to the side&mdash;relieved he doesn&apos;t have to leverage his husky frame for sword practice, ever closer to the free ale on the other side of the session, Katiya takes at least ten minutes before she can turn and face me again.</p>"

Some men look like they&apos;re about to cut the whole damn course, but the senior guards are back &mdash; and Aldrin set them up so no one can cut the others.

        "<p id=\"2.21.2.4\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Your trainees are depending on you to win, because they don&apos;t drink until your whole team does. So they&apos;ll be cheering you on, all along the way,&quot; Aldrin says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.5\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I can feel the adrenaline coarse through my veins, but mostly from the fear of getting crushed or stepped on. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.6\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Derry&apos;s hand rests on my shoulder. &quot;You&apos;re a young fella, and fast, I bet. You&apos;ll be able to shoot right through there!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.7\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;If they let me,&quot; I tell him.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.8\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll make them,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.9\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Aldrin counts down. Even for a fun run, I can feel the pressure mount on me as Katiya watches&mdash;and every time we meet eyes, I feel the urge build to impress her.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.10\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;He holds an archaic gun into the air. I hold my breath, waiting for the blast like it&apos;s winter track season all over again. I stagger my feet and let my fingers soak into the cold, wet soil, and just as I&apos;m about to anticipate the blast, I feel Derry&apos;s hands grasp my back.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.11\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The gun blast echoes between the mountains. Derry pushes me with all his strength, and suddenly I stagger into first: sliding a quarter-distance of the mud pit beneath the barbed wire.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I was a three-sport athlete, and I immediately think back to football season in the fall, when snow still saturated the frozen ground, and I&apos;m lighter than I was then when I wore pads and a helmet. Lighter than the ones before me, my elbows thrash the ground as mud splashes in my face, peerless in the moment, absorbed in the cheers that crescendo with my name.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My old-world shirt is soaked in heavy mud, and I&apos;m drenched down to the Under Armor compression shirt, but I feel that rare window of joy seize my body in its entirety, and I&apos;m thankful my emotional curse doesn&apos;t eclipse my enjoyment of the moment. I hear the sloshing and clambering of men that look like Vikings, grunting and growling with their lust of liquor.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I rise at the end of the mud crawl, glancing back to find my teammate Derry not far behind: his wife cheering him on from the sidelines. I hear Katiya shout my name, and turn to face the next obstacle: a tall climbing wall with several ropes hanging from the top. I&apos;m not as light as I was after a whole four years of shotgunning beers in the fraternity, but it feels as if I have circuits like Katiya, from all the energy that floods my veins.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My hands grasp the ragged weave of rope, tucking it beneath my arm as I take the first steps up the wall. The eyes are all on me now as I compensate for my previous failure. My arms grab hand-over-hand as the mud-soaked townies clamber like zombies, with groans that lust for liquor instead of brains, shaking the rope as they grasp it themselves, destabilizing my footing on the wall.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But I tighten my hands on the rope. Past halfway, I find it stretches less, advantaged by the boost from Derry that left the rope loose for much of my ascent. And as I approach the top, I feel my stomach drop when I look at the other side.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I thought it was another rope down. But instead, I find three logs spanning a two-story-high stretch from one tower to another: the bottom filled with murky, freezing water of an unknown depth. The adrenaline outpaces the panic as the crowd of knights and supporters shifts up to watch as I take my first steps on the log: tempted to hug and hump my way across, but I take a deep breath and take my time.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;So far down, Katiya and Jullian stand beside each other, along with Pax and Ryder and the catgirl Cae and a pale-looking Bertram that shakes his fist.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I scrape my muddy feet before I proceed: still a ways ahead of the others, and I take my time stepping across&mdash;like an alcoholic walking a line to show an officer that he can drive.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But I catch an odd footing. Panic seizes my chest when the elevation imposes itself, and I fall to my chest as the crowd groans in anticipation. But I hear their cheers still coming strong: Pax chanting &quot;Science Guy&quot; in their tongue until the others join, and they cheer when I regain my footing, stumbling slowly before I make it to the other side.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Next is a span of sixteen-or-so bars dangling over the same sickening drop. I doubt my adrenaline will last if I don&apos;t keep going: un-Essenced like the others and at a certain disadvantage.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But I continue: taking the first suspended bar in my hands as my feet decide whether they want to leave the safety of the platform, making the mistake of looking down and noticing patches of grass I HOPE are just floating, and not islands that would break my legs.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.23\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But the excitement is too great. My exhilarated mind flashes back to the breakaways of all those lacrosse games I miss so damn much with Miguel&mdash;and lost in the emotional rhyme, I realize I&apos;m already halfway across, steadily swinging between rails until I make it to the other side.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I turn back to find Derry waving at the other side, making some gesture I interpret as a &quot;thumbs-up&quot; as he waits to cross, using his meager townie Essence to strengthen his grasp before it&apos;s his turn to cross the bars.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The end of the towers is a series of vertical ropes. And as the others gain on me with their powerful arms, swinging like silverback gorillas, I slide down the rope after saturating my hands in the cool mud caked on my undershirt, regaining my footing as I make it to the bottom.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I reach the end of the &apos;U&apos;-shape to find the joining section as a simple sprint before more low-level towers at ground height, and I take off for the next side, watching as the Essenced knights double my speed to get a spot on the other side.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I feel a presence behind me. One of Jullian&apos;s non-guard buddies I recognize from before uses his advantage to sprint faster, and he&apos;s several breaths behind me as we round the last turn of the U-shape, coming to a near stop as we approach a bunch of logs that protrude from a gravel pit: a series of one-footed jumps that focus on technique over strength.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Half cheer my name. But half cheer for my adversary, named Delvin. We balance the desire for speed over the failure of the fall, wagering the swiftness of every jump. And as we&apos;re neck-and-neck, I decide to dash the rest of the logs, back in first as I make it to the last challenge.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;All that&apos;s left is one last straightaway with hurdles. It was my event in track when I was lighter, and had a six-pack on my body instead of in my hand every weekend. But the muscle memory is there, and as I take lane two of six, my rival takes four as we sprint with all we have, letting the fanfare flood our muscles where our exasperated breath falls short.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My steps reach a rhythm like I&apos;m sprinting down the hundred-meter span of hurdles on my high school track: over the long logs in seven steps and a leap, seven steps and a leap, seven steps and a leap.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The goal is getting closer, stacked with kegs. The beautiful town ladies are tensioned with corsets that rise their breasts as a beckoning call to the grizzly men behind us, raising mugs of fresh ale as sirens that call their lascivious warriors to come.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;A leap and seven steps. A leap and seven steps. And I see Katiya at the finish, smiling ear-to-ear as her boyfriend stands next to her, cheering on Delvin. And I&apos;m so close now, about to place first, when I hear a pained groan and a loud exhale as Delvin crumples into the second-to-last log hurdle.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;And I stop in my tracks, inches from the finish. I look behind me to find Delvin grasping his chest without wind as the horde of others is quickly approaching.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.34\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But I decide to turn around as I huff for breath, climbing over the log to approach my rival, offering him a hand so he can rise from the sullen ground.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.35\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I take his arm across my shoulders. A few racers sprint past us, transfixed by the boobs and ale ahead of them. And as we stumble over the logs in steps instead of leaps, I feel Delvin&apos;s weight shift when Derry grabs his other arm.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.36\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;We finish twelfth-or-so. Katiya and all her friends congratulate the three of us when we cross. The air stinks of salty sweat, but the ale is sweet and savory as we chug the carbonated brew like cold water.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.37\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;We hang around for a while until Aldrin presents an award to first place, and though he recognizes my efforts, he presents it to another lean, younger man that passed us while we carried Delvin. Katiya and a few friends watch my face as I react to this loss, and though Delvin is distraught, I laugh and cheer as the winner holds his makeshift trophy in the air.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.38\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I find an emotion in Katiya&apos;s face that I&apos;ve never seen before. She looks away when I return her glance. Her other friends chatter on about how I deserve the title, and even Jullian offers me words of encouragement, thanking me for aiding his friend.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.39\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;A long day ends with us walking home. I say I left my stuff at Katiya&apos;s so we could all walk together, and when they&apos;re all distracted, I slip inside and disappear through the door&mdash;quick to feel the bliss of a hot shower.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.40\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;After toweling off, I head downstairs to grab a glass of water in my boxers. I hear Jullian and Katiya heading upstairs on their side of the dimensional wall. Katiya whispers something to Jullian as he continues to climb the stairs, and after she takes off her heavy boots, I hear her footfalls as she approaches my door.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.41\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She knocks with a knuckle. I&apos;m quick to answer on the other side, peeking out no more than my head and a shoulder.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.42\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Hey &mdash; thanks for doing this today,&quot; she whispers. &quot;You surely didn&apos;t start off so well, but you ended in a blaze.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.43\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; I tell her. &quot;It was worth the PTO.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.44\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She turns to close the door, but then hesitates for a moment: something still on her mind that she&apos;s tempted to ask. &quot;But at the end there . . . you were surely going to win,&quot; she says. &quot;Why did you give Delvin a hand before you crossed?&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.45\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She looks up with anticipation, as if she disbelieves the face I wore when they were handing out awards. But something makes her want to hear me say it: to convince her of something.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.46\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;And so I tell her the truth.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.21.2.47\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I just didn&apos;t think the ale would taste any different,&quot; I whisper. &quot;You know?&quot;</p>"

      "<p>&emsp;And so I sell him a lie.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just don&apos;t see how this shirt looks any different,&quot; I say, &quot;you know?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He glares at me through the door. &quot;Different? You still look like you were ripped out of the high Middle Ages.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I have no idea what he means. &quot;But it&apos;s a shirt with a collar, right?&quot; I ask. &quot;I don&apos;t have the fancy noble clothes from your world. This was woven by hand!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And it looks like you&apos;re off to add your name to the Drclaration Of Independence,&quot; he says. Cody cracks a smile as he slips his feet onto a pair of his work shoes, wearing what he calls a weekend-formal shirt with stretchy fabric and a sharp collar.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Are you really sure you want me to go, then? All you&apos;ve done is insult me since I showed you the only other outfit I have,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;m dressed by the guard. They only let me take a hundred pounds of personal items when I came here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It shows,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;I sneer at him. &quot;Are you done?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He rises to his feet, taking one last glance at the odd texture of my shirt: thin in some areas, and mildly frayed from wearing it beneath my armor.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not yet. Give me a second,&quot; he says, retreating back upstairs to rustle through his cupboard. Half a minute later, he returns with another nice shirt. It&apos;s stitched with the letters NAVIDSON-MONROE: evidently woven by one of the fancy machines of his world.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m going to fill a whole closet from you at this rate,&quot; I say, hesitant to take another garment.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s been like a month since the last time I gave you that shirt,&quot; he says. &quot;And we still haven&apos;t even properly shopped for you yet. I got this in a New Years raffle from my company when they were trying to empty out the old employee storeroom. It&apos;s a women&apos;s medium, and I don&apos;t have the body for it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He extends his hand though the doorway. I crack the door shut to quickly change, trading the bright, uneven stitch-work for a smooth, silken, short-sleeve polo, surprised by how little I feel of the texture &mdash; and in moments like these, it makes me hesitant to indulge any further in even the simplest of his world&apos;s conveniences.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well?&quot; He asks. I crack the door open again as he takes his work passport into his pocket. His eyes glow with a certain sarcastic pride. &quot;You look like a new intern. Just don&apos;t ask the guys for any questions on your projects, or they&apos;ll never leave you alone.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I get the impression it&apos;s some backhanded compliment. &quot;I&apos;ll be quiet unless talked to.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, not this time,&quot; he says. &quot;The whole point is to interact with people! You get to meet my team: it&apos;s an open house. The world left behind keeping women quiet a while ago.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay. And...&quot; I gesture to my boots: the last oddity we haven&apos;t discussed. It&apos;s the casual pair, emblazoned with the faintest trace of metal around the toe and heel. &quot;Are these really okay?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just means you can go on the floor, if you&apos;re wearing steel toes like that.&quot; Cody gestures for me to enter his car port. &quot;You look fine. We should really get moving, or else they&apos;ll eat all the pizza before we can even get there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He cracks the door to the car port, and the solid steel gate slides along the rails. It&apos;s been more than a month since my first and last adventure in his car, and I feel ready to withstand all the twists and turns.</p><p>&emsp;I gently feather the car door open and sit in the seat. My body feels so light and free without the weight of the armor, as if I&apos;m wearing nothing at all, and after he pulls out of the car room into the street, the gate closes behind us.</p><p>&emsp;We take a different route this time, driving straight instead of turning left. It&apos;s been about a month since the self-defense training program, and with all that time passed in forgettable engagements, we share a couple stories from our lives.</p><p>&emsp;I describe how fast the town of Gaffesend transitions from festive joy to dreadful unease. I talk about the letters from my family back home, and how proud they say they are of my brother and I &mdash; though I&apos;m glad they aren&apos;t around to see what the other townsfolk think. I tell him how my mistake still overshadows me, and that I&apos;m glad they&apos;ve forgotten my foolish leap between buildings, and how I&apos;ve returned to prowling the streets.</p><p>&emsp;He tells me about work, but doesn&apos;t say much: just that he&apos;s nervous about being let go, and that he&apos;s developing something &quot;stupid&quot; that might make or break his career. I&apos;m entranced by the unfamiliar foliage that whips past us, pretending we&apos;re driving on the backroads between Gaffesend and the capital, surprised at how open Cody&apos;s world actually is when you get away from all the tall buildings.</p><p>&emsp;I ask him about Kei: he says not much has changed. He asks me about Jullian, and I say not much has changed, either: still middling in our relationship.</p><p>&emsp;His eyes glaze over with an unfamiliar joy when we wind the switchbacks, taking the turns with a certain passion, and though we&apos;re taking his daily passage to work, I doubt it&apos;s related to his employment.</p><p>&emsp;We pull up to the gates an hour after midday to find them open. The armor-less guard waves us through, and we come to a stop in a large dirt lot.</p><p>&emsp;Cody looks at me before we exit, as if to say something, but then his face falls. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Damn it,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He rifles through the center cupboard on his car, pulling out a cheap pair of dark glasses with letters on the side. &quot;Here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;For what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I forgot about your eyes,&quot; he says. &quot;I just got so used to them from looking in them all the time.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My face flushes. &quot;Are you&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No . . . no! Not at all. Calm down,&quot; he says, covering his face with a nicer pair of glasses as he gestures for me to exit. I CAREFULLY open the door, so I don&apos;t hit the vehicle next to me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You keep disguising glasses on you?&quot; I ask. &quot;When would you need them?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;They protect your eyes from the sun, dummy,&quot; he says, overcompensating for his accidental pick-up line. I feel my nerves rise as we approach the massive building, shaded like night as I look through the lenses, my body masked behind Cody as a nervous shadow.</p><p>&emsp;An unfamiliar voice calls to him as we approach his colleagues. &quot;So you finally made it to your first work event,&quot; the lady says. &quot;Even I made it to one before you!&quot; Her face changes when she sees me step out from behind Cody, reminding me a little bit of Jullian. &quot;And who is this you brought?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is Katiya. A neighbor of mine,&quot; Cody says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; I say, speaking seamlessly in Cody&apos;s tongue.</p>&quot;And I&apos;m Kei,&quot; she says, shaking my hand gently. &quot;Kei Sakurashima.&quot;",
      "<p>&emsp;The installation looks like one of those dug-in shelters on the border of the Purgatory Line, and when we enter the quaint area dug into the side of the mountain, facing the set of reflective steel doors, I expect they&apos;ll open to a grand chamber beneath the ground.</p><p>&emsp;But when Cody&apos;s paramour presses the glowing arrow button, the doors slide open with a chime, exposing a tiny room that the three of us enter. The metal doors are just about to close when a fourth guy shows up, sticking his hands directly into the metal jaws to keep them open.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s a young man with the same aesthetic as Cody, except he has beach-blonde hair and a much more energized personality. He stares at me with his hazel eyes. &quot;Ha! Looks like I made it just in time,&quot; he says. &quot;Cody, my man, and Kei. And who are you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;His conversational flow throws me off guard, stammering for words, but he speaks again.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m Reed. Reed Broderick,&quot; he says, extending his hand.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m Katiya,&quot; I manage, giving his hand a gentle-but-firm shake. &quot;Katiya Bre&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;But as soon as the doors close, the room jostles upwards, catching me off guard as I nearly fall, taking both Cody and Reed&apos;s hands.</p><p>&emsp;The two men lift me to my feet.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Bad hangover, huh?&quot; Kei asks. &quot;I hope Cody didn&apos;t challenge you to any drinking games. Ever since he joined that fraternity, he became a fish!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I ask, &quot;A fish? As in...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody cuts the silence with a laugh. &quot;Very funny. We thought we&apos;d pregame this little mixer to make it go faster, you know?&quot; And then he takes me aside, muttering to me under the tone of his breath. &quot;You can take the shades off now.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But my eyes,&quot; I whisper. &quot;Won&apos;t they think I&apos;m weird?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s fine. Remember the lie I gave you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Caused-play,&quot; I say. &quot;But shouldn&apos;t I at least know what caused this?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody creases his brow with his fingers in disappointment as the man called Reed continues.  &quot;Well, hey, quite a coincidence you work at Navidson-Monroe too, huh?&quot; He asks, pointing to my shirt. It says ENGINEERING TEAM beneath it. &quot;So are you, like, a purchaser or something? Or are you on the Aerospace team? I don&apos;t see you in the main office,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;I stammer over a response, watching Cody prevent his face from changing shades of red when he realizes he&apos;s trapped himself again. &quot;It was that shirt I won in the raffle that didn&apos;t fit me,&quot; he says, &quot;and I decided to give it to her.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Kei laughs. &quot;You don&apos;t have to explain,&quot; she says, catching contagion of Cody&apos;s secondhand embarrassment. &quot;Unless you&apos;re dating or something. But even then, you know. You wouldn&apos;t have to...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re not,&quot; Cody insists, turning his eyes down as Reed masterfully switches subjects.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well then I hope it will be a better raffle this year. My dad said they were just emptying out the corporate closet of shirts before the moths could get to them. And all those mugs and pencils and flash drives they were handing out at the job fairs,&quot; Reed says. His piercing eyes meet mine. &quot;Say, Katiya: where do you work if you don&apos;t work here?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. I work in, uh, military.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody elbows me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The military?&quot; Reed smiles. &quot;Nice, Just like my cousin. Well, thank you for your service. What branch? Are you at the Air Force base up north or something?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m in the mountains,&quot; I say, unsure how much further I&apos;m digging myself, wondering if I could ever be ready enough for Cody to bring me anywhere.</p><p>&emsp;Cody interjects, &quot;She&apos;s stationed up near Grand Lake, working on some topographical research, for uh, NOAA.&quot; He glares at me, but in a humored way. &quot;Guess we shouldn&apos;t have pre-gamed so hard, huh? I told you to start clear.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you two seem pretty close,&quot; Kei says. &quot;Reed and I had to cheat, making each other our plus one.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody opens his mouth to speak, but then the doors open, just as he ushers the words: &quot;So you guys...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The carriage lets out to a breathtaking atrium with a curved glass ceiling, surrounded on both sides by stairs and private walled rooms. The chatter is almost deafening from the volume of well-dressed people &mdash; like a royal ball &mdash; and when I look up to the sky, I find a full view of the mountainside through the ceiling glass.</p><p>&emsp;But a lady is poised at the top, standing there with her husband that almost looks like one of our farmers from his brawny arms. As she approaches, exposing a name tag that says KIMBERLY (KIM), I find a reticence suddenly take over Cody, even though it&apos;s too late.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Kei! Oh, hey, so good to see you,&quot; she says, smiling with dimples from ear-to-ear. &quot;And there&apos;s my son. Won&apos;t you say hello?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey, Mom,&quot; Cody says. &quot;And Dad,&quot; as he approaches.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, don&apos;t look so surprised. Both my boys work here,&quot; Cody&apos;s mother says. &quot;I swear. The last time I saw you two cuties dressed up together was Junior Prom. And that&apos;s before you vanished into our basement all night, to&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cost lunges between Kei and Reed. &quot;Whoa, whoa, already too far, Mom,&quot; he says, redder than a tomato.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. I just assumed you were Kei&apos;s plus one, like last time?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not this time, Mrs. C,&quot; Kei says. &quot;Reed here asked me to the dance this time.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh,&quot; Cody&apos;s mother Kim says. &quot;So Cody&apos;s flying solo this time.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody&apos;s dad almost looks disappointed for a second before Kei interjects. &quot;Not this time. He brought a neighbor-friend.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;They turn their faces to me. And after they look me up and down, I almost gleam a sense of pride lighting their faces again.</p><p>&emsp;I extend my hand. &quot;It&apos;s truly an honor to make your acquaintance,&quot; I say. &quot;Your son and I live next door to each other.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well isn&apos;t he a lucky son of a gun?&quot; Alan says, and I feel the urge to drag Cody away before his redness turns to blue. Reed begins to introduce himself to Kim with Kei as Alan gestures for us to keep walking. &quot;Well, don&apos;t let an old chunk of coal like me hold you kids up. It&apos;s nice to meet ya.&quot; He gives me a firm handshake. I tension my hand a little harder than usual.  &quot;And sweet Jesus, she&apos;s got a grip!&quot; He turns to his progeny. Some surly thought skips the queue in his mind. &quot;Son, you know what they say about strong wrists in a woman&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say, &quot;nice to meet you.&quot; I take Cody&apos;s hand to rush him to the water table, pulsing some healing Essence into him so he might not pass out, but he seems fine. I barricade us both with a group of young trainees from a local seminary, led around by their instructor.</p><p>&emsp;He scans the table until he finds something harder, flashing his badge so they give him a painted can. After a crack and several guzzles later, his soul returns. &quot;Thanks for saving me, there,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s kind of my job,&quot; I tell him. Then I grin. &quot;So is that what you brought me here for? A piece of arm candy to get your love interest off that other guy&apos;s arm?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It would make sense,&quot; he says, fisting a second cup of water. &quot;But no.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then why?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll tell you later,&quot; he says. &quot;But how about we look around?&quot;</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I spend the rest of the day in Cody&apos;s shadow, avoiding long conversations with his coworkers and eating as much of the free food as we can. And after watching as many of the children&apos;s science demonstrations as possible &mdash; while Cody eagerly riffed on about all these concepts named after scientists &mdash; we take a break on the east balcony that opposes the view from the elevator, looking out across his world&apos;s well-developed landscape.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s fluids,&quot; I say. &quot;You say you&apos;re studying fluids when you study aeroplanes. But fluid is water, not air.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Air has a lot of the same properties of fluids, so we call it fluids,&quot; he says. Then he mentions several scientists from his world as if name-dropping will support his argument. Bernoulli. Lagrange. Some guy he says is an oiler, which sounds like he deals with fluids, only supporting me further.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s Euler,&quot; he says, beginning to gesture with hands that only hurt his explanation. &quot;So there&apos;s streamlines, like this,&quot; he gestures, &quot;that you look at,&quot; he gestures, &quot;you know,&quot; he gestures again, &quot;and then there&apos;s streaklines. And you can look at it through the LaGrangian form that emphasizes states of a moving frame of reference, but the Euler form is for a control volume FIXED instead of moving, and in Aerospace, which is what I want to get into, I find that . . .&quot;</p><p>&emsp;There&apos;s something entrancing about his passion when he rattles on about concepts I can&apos;t hope to understand. I find such a radiant light when I meet eyes with his, and he thinks he&apos;s explaining it clearly.</p><p>&emsp;I nod my head as I turn to gaze out across the landscape, still bright with early-morning sun, trying to wrap my head around the fact that this whole landmass is safe from ocean to ocean. And with no clear lines partitioning them, the buildings grow like weeds without the culling force of constant conflict.</p><p>&emsp;&quot; . . . So Bernoulli says the pressure difference pushes up on the wing,&quot; he says, spouting more names and using his Navidson-Monroe water bottle now as a prop. I forget to nod. &quot;And now I realize you have no idea what I&apos;m talking about.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I smile. &quot;But your enthusiasm is refreshing. Pray tell: do you know how many people have the emotional resources to be passionate like you where I live?&quot; I say. &quot;Your people focus on designing planes and big machines. All our people have to think about is what&apos;s moving around in the dark.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s why you should come over more,&quot; Cody says. &quot;You might have scared me at first, but I like spending time with you now.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I adjust my sweaty hand on the hot steel railing, unaware I&apos;m sliding closer to his. &quot;You aren&apos;t too bad either,&quot; I say. We touch with a spark, then withdraw our hands. &quot;A good friend. I&apos;m just afraid of getting comfortable with all of this.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Understandable,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;I put on the sun glasses instead of squinting my eyes, and Cody points out landmarks. A cluster of red rocks in the shape of an amphitheatre. His parents&apos; house in Hearthland Ridge. And our house &mdash; I mean, his house, across the lake, muddled in a cluster of homes.</p><p>&emsp;We step inside to tour the last section we haven&apos;t seen yet: the Engineering showroom, with models of all the famous planes like the Flawless Diamond and the SR-71. Cody continues his ramblings, dumbing them down a little further as I look at him with a refreshing sense of admiration. He talks in my language of war: about the big bombs named after a little boy and a heavy man, and the cold war between nations that followed. The planes were made for spy missions, surveying enemy lands at unfathomable speeds.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe one day I can see the view from one of those,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe you will,&quot; he says, turning to face the last presentation wall we haven&apos;t seen yet. It reads FUTURE ENGINEERING TALENT, with a few profiles of new engineers. </p><p>&emsp;He scans through the posted pages like trainees at the Academy after an exam. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What is this?&quot; He asks, trying to mask his words as only those of curious interest, but then mutters, &quot;a fucking email sent to them?&quot; His fingers trace the dates of hire. &quot;Some have been here longer than I have!&quot; And when his hand reaches the profile on the guy in the elevator, his hand balls into a fist.</p><p>&emsp;I approach him. &quot;What&apos;s wrong?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He pulls out his smart telephone, scrolling frantically through it, opening an app with messages that read longer than a simple text. He scrolls the subjects of those correspondences, getting angrier and more dejected as he looks further and further. &quot;So they just don&apos;t consider me, huh? Because my dad doesn&apos;t have a fucking name around here, and I came from nothing, so they&mdash;&quot; He curbs his words when he realizes I&apos;m still here. &quot;Heh. Sorry, Katiya. Just some work stuff,&quot; he says, smiling with an embarrassed laugh.</p><p>&emsp;He hears voices behind us coming around the hall, and he drags me beneath one of the displays. I open my mouth to protest, but he covers it, and I recognize the voices in an instant.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Finally somewhere quiet, huh?&quot; Reed asks. &quot;I might be good at the social stuff, but even I&apos;m pretty tapped out.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And I never get out,&quot; Kei says. She walks towards the display we&apos;re hiding behind. I watch Cody&apos;s mind scroll through possible explanations to diffuse the embarrassment, but just as she&apos;s about to cross our hiding spot&mdash;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Here it is,&quot; Reed says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot; We watch Kei&apos;s heels pivot as she turns.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You never got the email about this?&quot; He asks. &quot;You&apos;re still new enough, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The new talent wall? I think I forgot to respond to the email about it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It was something the Engineering Director was pushing through. Said he wanted to highlight some of the fresh talent.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We hear silence as they scan the wall for something. &quot;There&apos;s mine,&quot; Reed says. But Kei looks further.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I really hope he hasn&apos;t come in here,&quot; Kei says. &quot;Haven&apos;t seen Cody or that neighbor he brought, so I hope they went home.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Another silence.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. He&apos;s not even on the wall,&quot; Reed says. &quot;Did he not fill it out?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He totally would have filled it out. You see the way he looks up at this place? His eyes get more sun dreaming of this place than any of the lifers that sit next to the windows.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe it was an accident. Some kind of mix-up?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know about that,&quot; Reed says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How can you be so sure?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just something I&apos;ve thought about since I came here. Some talk between my dad and his best friend, the Director of Engineering.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, he got you hired here,&quot; Kei says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But there was more,&quot; Reed says. &quot;I was listening to them on the patio out back behind our place. He said he&apos;s clearing the way for me. And that &apos;that other engineer wouldn&apos;t be an obstacle.&apos;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The &apos;other engineer?&apos; You don&apos;t mean...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He said Cody was unexceptional. Just did his time and left, not really ever trying once he reached a certain point. That the life left him. That he never makes an effort to meet anyone, and that he&apos;d be easy to make an excuse for,&quot; Reed says, and I watch Cody bow his head as he balls his fists. &quot;I mean, I like the guy a lot. We&apos;re pretty similar, and I really want to be buddies with him.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Kei takes a long pause. And I almost think she&apos;ll stand up for him. I hope she does, for Cody&apos;s sake, but she says something else. &quot;We used to be pretty close, you know. High school, we dated: just like his mom said, and he was so full of this joy, it was like staring at the sun.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Reed asks, &quot;But what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But the summer I left for school was when he lost his brother.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He lost his brother?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. To some conflict in the war: Jackson was a Navy SEAL. And Cody never opened up about it. And by the time his last year of high school ended, he followed me to college, but I couldn&apos;t even recognize him. He was just a shell. And he still is, though sometimes there&apos;s a glimmer of that guy who had so much joy. That I liked a lot,&quot; Kei says, looking around nervously. &quot;I hope something changes. Because he&apos;s surely next out of all of us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;They turn to leave. And Reed says, &quot;Well, at least I can be that for you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Kei laughs. &quot;I still don&apos;t know if I&apos;m ready for that,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;I feel angry for him. I want to stand up and call them out for speaking so ill of him. In fact, I begin to stand, but Cody weakly grabs my borrowed shirt.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Stand down, soldier,&quot; Cody says. &quot;It&apos;s alright. Nothing they said was wrong.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But this Reed guy is slighting you! His family line is aimed to cut you down because you&apos;re in his way, though you&apos;re the venerable one,&quot; I say, grabbing his shirt while I turn his chin to look in my eyes, finding the crest of his tears ready to break.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe I deserve it,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve become a mess since then. I dragged myself through this stupid degree because it&apos;s what I used to want to do. I&apos;m running on fumes of a past when I was fueled on that thing: the spark, what Kei and anyone else liked about me.&quot; He sniffles, trying to keep his tears to a professional medium. &quot;No passion. No prospect of a girlfriend in years. I don&apos;t know . . . I think I just suck now. Even my parents can sniff it out.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;His words anger me because they insult someone I&apos;ve come to care about, and it&apos;s him, and of all my years of guarding, I feel nothing more than the urge to protect this guy and his precious dream.</p><p>&emsp;I feel the heat rise in my circuits as I grab the collar of his shirt, forcing him to look at me as I pin him against the display. I dissolve his tears with the Essence in my hands. &quot;You listen. Your dreams are far from stupid, Cody Dunsmore, and you are gods-damn precious,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;He looks down. &quot;You&apos;re just&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Shut up,&quot; I command, jostling him against the wall to shock him into a sense of truth. &quot;Can&apos;t you see that you&apos;re already enough as you are? You say the ale doesn&apos;t taste any different. And you&apos;re the only person I&apos;ve ever found who means it. You care,&quot; I say, &quot;so Gods-damn much about anyone.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s just lonely,&quot; he says. He gestures for me to get off him, and I help him to his feet. &quot;I think something broke in me that I can&apos;t fix.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I said I&apos;d tell you why I invited you here. I mean, yeah &mdash; all the engineers and techs and business guys were ogling you, and you&apos;re an amazing piece of arm candy. You even made my family have faith in me again.&quot; He laughs. &quot;But I brought you here because I have no one else to share this with. It feels like everyone&apos;s left me or moved on. And I&apos;m tired now. And it&apos;s getting so late.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I wrap my arms around him, letting the heat of my body speak where my words fall short. He hesitates, but then gently returns my embrace, holding for just a second before he releases. And even in his act of forced vulnerability, I almost feel a piece of myself open, too.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Bastards,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Bastards have probably already eaten their way through the food trucks,&quot; he says. &quot;I totally forgot. Usually it&apos;s like eight bucks for a slice of pizza, but Navidson-Monroe&apos;s footing the bill.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I don&apos;t know what a food truck is. But if it&apos;s designed to move, and it has food in it, I assume it won&apos;t be around for long.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And hey,&quot; Cody says. &quot;You have to be careful saying stuff like that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask, noticing his face flushes lightly now that we&apos;re out of the dark.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You have a boyfriend. And yet you almost made me break our tenth rule.&quot;</p><p>&emsp; &quot;Then you must be weak,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Too weak for me,&quot; I say, though I feel refreshed by his sincerity. &quot;But that doesn&apos;t mean I can&apos;t help you.&quot;</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;She waits until I&apos;m fully seated in the car to tell me the news. And when she does, I feel both relieved and horrified at the same time &mdash; like the wife that tells her husband he&apos;s packing the largest out of all his friends.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You did what?&quot; I ask. &quot;Really? But when?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s when you were busy moping around behind the ration trucks,&quot; Katiya says, with a smug grin. &quot;But I didn&apos;t embarrass you too much.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I start the car, mute the volume, then feel my head lower into my hands. &quot;How bad is the damage? And what the hell did you say?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I said you&apos;re terrible at communicating.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, great. And what else?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That you and I have nothing between us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; I ask. &quot;And what good things did you say?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not much,&quot; Katiya says. &quot;Just that you talk about her a lot.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, great. So I&apos;m a creep and a loser. So it&apos;s a pity date?&quot; I ask, starting to feel worse than I did in the exhibition hall.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. She almost looked relieved when I said we weren&apos;t a thing,&quot; she says, &quot;and when I asked her out for you, she said &apos;yes&apos; right away.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Really?&quot; I say, feeling a glimmer of hopeful excitement I haven&apos;t felt in a while. I put the car in drive. &quot;You&apos;re not just saying that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Katiya laughs. &quot;Of course not. I can tell. Despite all the tomboy stuff, I&apos;m a woman like her, you know,&quot; she says. &quot;She only had one condition, though.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;She wants to be my friend. Says &apos;friends are hard to come by at this age.&apos; And then she asked for my number.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I pass the gate, waving to the guard whose name I should know by this point. &quot;So what did you say?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I said I left it at home. Then she gave me a sticky page from her purse instead.&quot; She holds up a sticky note with flowery girl handwriting on it. &quot;So what do I do now?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We get you a phone,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Take it as a token of my thanks.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But won&apos;t I get addicted to it? Like the children of your world and their cat movies?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You can leave it at my place, or whatever. I don&apos;t care,&quot; I say, adding the phone store as another stop on the way home. &quot;You can even get a basic one, without all the brain-rot stuff. I&apos;ll show you how to use it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;And she agrees. And I&apos;m relieved &mdash; because I have no idea how to shop for clothes with her.</p>"

        "<p id=\"2.22.1.4\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I have no idea what he means. &quot;But it&apos;s a shirt with a collar, right?&quot; I ask. &quot;I don&apos;t have the fancy noble clothes from your world. This was woven by hand!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.5\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And it looks like you&apos;re off to add your name to the Drclaration Of Independence,&quot; he says.

        "<p id=\"2.22.1.6\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Are you really sure you want me to go, then? All you&apos;ve done is insult me since I showed you the only other outfit I have,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;m dressed by the guard. They only let me take a hundred pounds of personal items when I came here.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.7\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;It shows,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.8\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I sneer at him. &quot;Are you done?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.9\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He rises to his feet, taking one last glance at the odd texture of my shirt: thin in some areas, and mildly frayed from wearing it beneath my armor.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.10\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Not yet. Give me a second,&quot; he says, retreating back upstairs to rustle through his cupboard. Half a minute later, he returns with another nice shirt. It&apos;s stitched with the letters NAVIDSON-MONROE: evidently woven by one of the fancy machines of his world.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.11\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m going to fill a whole closet from you at this rate,&quot; I say, hesitant to take another garment.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.12\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s been like a month since the last time I gave you that shirt,&quot; he says. &quot;And we still haven&apos;t even properly shopped for you yet. I got this in a New Years raffle from my company when they were trying to empty out the old employee storeroom. It&apos;s a women&apos;s medium, and I don&apos;t have the body for it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.13\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He extends his hand though the doorway. I crack the door shut to quickly change, trading the bright, uneven stitch-work for a smooth, silken, short-sleeve polo, surprised by how little I feel of the texture &mdash; and in moments like these, it makes me hesitant to indulge any further in even the simplest of his world&apos;s conveniences.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Well?&quot; He asks. I crack the door open again as he takes his work passport into his pocket. His eyes glow with a certain sarcastic pride. &quot;You look like a new intern. Just don&apos;t ask the guys for any questions on your projects, or they&apos;ll never leave you alone.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I get the impression it&apos;s some backhanded compliment. &quot;I&apos;ll be quiet unless talked to.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.22.1.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Okay. And...&quot; I gesture to my boots: the last oddity we haven&apos;t discussed. It&apos;s the casual pair, emblazoned with the faintest trace of metal around the toe and heel. &quot;Are these really okay?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Just means you can go on the floor, if you&apos;re wearing steel toes like that.&quot; Cody gestures for me to enter his car port. &quot;You look fine.

        "<p id=\"2.22.1.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He cracks the door to the car port, and the solid steel gate slides along the rails. It&apos;s been more than a month since my first and last adventure in his car, and I feel ready to withstand all the twists and turns.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I gently feather the car door open and sit in the seat. My body feels so light and free without the weight of the armor, as if I&apos;m wearing nothing at all, and after he pulls out of the car room into the street, the gate closes behind us.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.21\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We take a different route this time, driving straight instead of turning left.

        "<p id=\"2.22.1.22\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I describe how fast the town of Gaffesend transitions from festive joy to dreadful unease. I talk about the letters from my family back home, and how proud they say they are of my brother and I &mdash; though I&apos;m glad they aren&apos;t around to see what the other townsfolk think. I tell him how my mistake still overshadows me, and that I&apos;m glad they&apos;ve forgotten my foolish leap between buildings, and how I&apos;ve returned to prowling the streets.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.23\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He tells me about work, but doesn&apos;t say much: just that he&apos;s nervous about being let go, and that he&apos;s developing something &quot;stupid&quot; that might make or break his career. I&apos;m entranced by the unfamiliar foliage that whips past us, pretending we&apos;re driving on the backroads between Gaffesend and the capital, surprised at how open Cody&apos;s world actually is when you get away from all the tall buildings.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I ask him about Kei: he says not much has changed. He asks me about Jullian, and I say not much has changed, either: still middling in our relationship.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;His eyes glaze over with an unfamiliar joy when we wind the switchbacks, taking the turns with a certain passion, and though we&apos;re taking his daily passage to work, I doubt it&apos;s related to his employment.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We pull up to the gates an hour after midday to find them open. The armor-less guard waves us through, and we come to a stop in a large dirt lot.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.22.1.35\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You keep disguising glasses on you?&quot; I ask. &quot;When would you need them?&quot;</p>",

I feel my nerves rise as we approach the massive building, shaded like night as I look through the lenses, my body masked behind Cody as a nervous shadow.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.37\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;An unfamiliar voice calls to him as we approach his colleagues. &quot;So you finally made it to your first work event,&quot; the lady says. &quot;Even I made it to one before you!&quot; Her face changes when she sees me step out from behind Cody, reminding me a little bit of Jullian. &quot;And who is this you brought?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.1.38\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;This is Katiya. A neighbor of mine,&quot; Cody says.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.22.2.2\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But when Cody&apos;s paramour presses the glowing arrow button, the doors slide open with a chime, exposing a tiny room that the three of us enter. The metal doors are just about to close when a fourth guy shows up, sticking his hands directly into the metal jaws to keep them open.</p>",

It says ENGINEERING TEAM beneath it. &quot;So are you, like, a purchaser or something? Or are you on the Aerospace team? I don&apos;t see you in the main office,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.2.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I stammer over a response, watching Cody prevent his face from changing shades of red when he realizes he&apos;s trapped himself again. &quot;It was that shirt I won in the raffle that didn&apos;t fit me,&quot; he says, &quot;and I decided to give it to her.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.2.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Kei laughs. &quot;You don&apos;t have to explain,&quot; she says, catching contagion of Cody&apos;s secondhand embarrassment. &quot;Unless you&apos;re dating or something. But even then, you know. You wouldn&apos;t have to...&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.22.2.23\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m in the mountains,&quot; I say, unsure how much further I&apos;m digging myself, wondering if I could ever be ready enough for Cody to bring me anywhere.</p>",

I told you to start clear.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.2.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Well, you two seem pretty close,&quot; Kei says. &quot;Reed and I had to cheat, making each other our plus one.&quot;</p>",

It&apos;s nice to meet ya.&quot; He gives me a firm handshake. I tension my hand a little harder than usual.  &quot;And sweet Jesus, she&apos;s got a grip!&quot; He turns to his progeny.

I barricade us both with a group of young trainees from a local seminary, led around by their instructor.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.2.41\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He scans the table until he finds something harder, flashing his badge so they give him a painted can. After a crack and several guzzles later, his soul returns. &quot;Thanks for saving me, there,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.2.42\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s kind of my job,&quot; I tell him. Then I grin. &quot;So is that what you brought me here for? A piece of arm candy to get your love interest off that other guy&apos;s arm?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.2.43\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;It would make sense,&quot; he says, fisting a second cup of water. &quot;But no.&quot;</p>",

And after watching as many of the children&apos;s science demonstrations as possible &mdash; while Cody eagerly riffed on about all these concepts named after scientists &mdash; we take a break on the east balcony that opposes the view from the elevator, looking out across his world&apos;s well-developed landscape.</p>",

And you can look at it through the LaGrangian form that emphasizes states of a moving frame of reference, but the Euler form is for a control volume FIXED instead of moving, and in Aerospace, which is what I want to get into, I find that . . .&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.5\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;There&apos;s something entrancing about his passion when he rattles on about concepts I can&apos;t hope to understand. I find such a radiant light when I meet eyes with his, and he thinks he&apos;s explaining it clearly.</p>",

His parents&apos; house in Hearthland Ridge. And our house &mdash; I mean, his house, across the lake, muddled in a cluster of homes.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.13\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;We step inside to tour the last section we haven&apos;t seen yet: the Engineering showroom, with models of all the famous planes like the Flawless Diamond and the SR-71. Cody continues his ramblings, dumbing them down a little further as I look at him with a refreshing sense of admiration. He talks in my language of war: about the big bombs named after a little boy and a heavy man, and the cold war between nations that followed. The planes were made for spy missions, surveying enemy lands at unfathomable speeds.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.22.3.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He scans through the posted pages like trainees at the Academy after an exam. </p>",

        "<p id=\"2.22.3.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He pulls out his smart telephone, scrolling frantically through it, opening an app with messages that read longer than a simple text. He scrolls the subjects of those correspondences, getting angrier and more dejected as he looks further and further. &quot;So they just don&apos;t consider me, huh? Because my dad doesn&apos;t have a fucking name around here, and I came from nothing, so they&mdash;&quot; He curbs his words when he realizes I&apos;m still here. &quot;Heh. Sorry, Katiya. Just some work stuff,&quot; he says, smiling with an embarrassed laugh.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He hears voices behind us coming around the hall, and he drags me beneath one of the displays. I open my mouth to protest, but he covers it, and I recognize the voices in an instant.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.21\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Finally somewhere quiet, huh?&quot; Reed asks. &quot;I might be good at the social stuff, but even I&apos;m pretty tapped out.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.22\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And I never get out,&quot; Kei says. She walks towards the display we&apos;re hiding behind. I watch Cody&apos;s mind scroll through possible explanations to diffuse the embarrassment, but just as she&apos;s about to cross our hiding spot&mdash;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.23\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Here it is,&quot; Reed says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What?&quot; We watch Kei&apos;s heels pivot as she turns.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You never got the email about this?&quot; He asks. &quot;You&apos;re still new enough, right?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;The new talent wall? I think I forgot to respond to the email about it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.27\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;It was something the Engineering Director was pushing through. Said he wanted to highlight some of the fresh talent.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.22.3.33\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Oh. He&apos;s not even on the wall,&quot; Reed says. &quot;Did he not fill it out?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.34\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;He totally would have filled it out. You see the way he looks up at this place? His eyes get more sun dreaming of this place than any of the lifers that sit next to the windows.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.35\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Huh.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.36\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Maybe it was an accident. Some kind of mix-up?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.37\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know about that,&quot; Reed says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.38\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;How can you be so sure?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.39\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Just something I&apos;ve thought about since I came here. Some talk between my dad and his best friend, the Director of Engineering.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.40\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Well, he got you hired here,&quot; Kei says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.41\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But there was more,&quot; Reed says. &quot;I was listening to them on the patio out back behind our place. He said he&apos;s clearing the way for me. And that &apos;that other engineer wouldn&apos;t be an obstacle.&apos;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.42\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;The &apos;other engineer?&apos; You don&apos;t mean...&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.43\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;He said Cody was unexceptional. Just did his time and left, not really ever trying once he reached a certain point. That the life left him. That he never makes an effort to meet anyone, and that he&apos;d be easy to make an excuse for,&quot; Reed says, and I watch Cody bow his head as he balls his fists. &quot;I mean, I like the guy a lot. We&apos;re pretty similar, and I really want to be buddies with him.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.44\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Kei takes a long pause. And I almost think she&apos;ll stand up for him. I hope she does, for Cody&apos;s sake, but she says something else. &quot;We used to be pretty close, you know. High school, we dated: just like his mom said, and he was so full of this joy, it was like staring at the sun.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.45\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Reed asks, &quot;But what?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.46\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But the summer I left for school was when he lost his brother.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.47\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;He lost his brother?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.48\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah. To some conflict in the war: Jackson was a Navy SEAL. And Cody never opened up about it. And by the time his last year of high school ended, he followed me to college, but I couldn&apos;t even recognize him. He was just a shell. And he still is, though sometimes there&apos;s a glimmer of that guy who had so much joy. That I liked a lot,&quot; Kei says, looking around nervously. &quot;I hope something changes. Because he&apos;s surely next out of all of us.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.49\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;They turn to leave. And Reed says, &quot;Well, at least I can be that for you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.50\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Kei laughs. &quot;I still don&apos;t know if I&apos;m ready for that,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.51\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I feel angry for him. I want to stand up and call them out for speaking so ill of him. In fact, I begin to stand, but Cody weakly grabs my borrowed shirt.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.52\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Stand down, soldier,&quot; Cody says. &quot;It&apos;s alright. Nothing they said was wrong.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.53\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;But this Reed guy is slighting you! His family line is aimed to cut you down because you&apos;re in his way, though you&apos;re the venerable one,&quot; I say, grabbing his shirt while I turn his chin to look in my eyes, finding the crest of his tears ready to break.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.54\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Maybe I deserve it,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve become a mess since then. I dragged myself through this stupid degree because it&apos;s what I used to want to do. I&apos;m running on fumes of a past when I was fueled on that thing: the spark, what Kei and anyone else liked about me.&quot; He sniffles, trying to keep his tears to a professional medium. &quot;No passion. No prospect of a girlfriend in years. I don&apos;t know . . . I think I just suck now. Even my parents can sniff it out.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.55\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;His words anger me because they insult someone I&apos;ve come to care about, and it&apos;s him, and of all my years of guarding, I feel nothing more than the urge to protect this guy and his precious dream.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.56\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I feel the heat rise in my circuits as I grab the collar of his shirt, forcing him to look at me as I pin him against the display. I dissolve his tears with the Essence in my hands. &quot;You listen. Your dreams are far from stupid, Cody Dunsmore, and you are gods-damn precious,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.57\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;He looks down. &quot;You&apos;re just&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.58\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Shut up,&quot; I command, jostling him against the wall to shock him into a sense of truth. &quot;Can&apos;t you see that you&apos;re already enough as you are? You say the ale doesn&apos;t taste any different. And you&apos;re the only person I&apos;ve ever found who means it. You care,&quot; I say, &quot;so Gods-damn much about anyone.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.59\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s just lonely,&quot; he says. He gestures for me to get off him, and I help him to his feet. &quot;I think something broke in me that I can&apos;t fix.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.60\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.61\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I said I&apos;d tell you why I invited you here. I mean, yeah &mdash; all the engineers and techs and business guys were ogling you, and you&apos;re an amazing piece of arm candy. You even made my family have faith in me again.&quot; He laughs. &quot;But I brought you here because I have no one else to share this with. It feels like everyone&apos;s left me or moved on. And I&apos;m tired now. And it&apos;s getting so late.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.62\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I wrap my arms around him, letting the heat of my body speak where my words fall short. He hesitates, but then gently returns my embrace, holding for just a second before he releases. And even in his act of forced vulnerability, I almost feel a piece of myself open, too.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.63\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Bastards,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.64\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Huh?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.65\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Bastards have probably already eaten their way through the food trucks,&quot; he says. &quot;I totally forgot. Usually it&apos;s like eight bucks for a slice of pizza, but Navidson-Monroe&apos;s footing the bill.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.66\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I don&apos;t know what a food truck is. But if it&apos;s designed to move, and it has food in it, I assume it won&apos;t be around for long.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.67\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And hey,&quot; Cody says. &quot;You have to be careful saying stuff like that.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.68\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask, noticing his face flushes lightly now that we&apos;re out of the dark.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.69\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;You have a boyfriend. And yet you almost made me break our tenth rule.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.3.70\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp; &quot;Then you must be weak,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Too weak for me,&quot; I say, though I feel refreshed by his sincerity. &quot;But that doesn&apos;t mean I can&apos;t help you.&quot;</p>"
      ],
      [
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.1\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She waits until I&apos;m fully seated in the car to tell me the news. And when she does, I feel both relieved and horrified at the same time &mdash; like the wife that tells her husband he&apos;s packing the largest out of all his friends.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.2\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You did what?&quot; I ask. &quot;Really? But when?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.3\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s when you were busy moping around behind the ration trucks,&quot; Katiya says, with a smug grin. &quot;But I didn&apos;t embarrass you too much.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.4\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I start the car, mute the volume, then feel my head lower into my hands. &quot;How bad is the damage? And what the hell did you say?&quot; </p>",

        "<p id=\"2.22.4.9\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Not much,&quot; Katiya says. &quot;Just that you talk about her a lot.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.10\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh, great. So I&apos;m a creep and a loser. So it&apos;s a pity date?&quot; I ask, starting to feel worse than I did in the exhibition hall.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.11\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No. She almost looked relieved when I said we weren&apos;t a thing,&quot; she says, &quot;and when I asked her out for you, she said &apos;yes&apos; right away.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Really?&quot; I say, feeling a glimmer of hopeful excitement I haven&apos;t felt in a while. I put the car in drive. &quot;You&apos;re not just saying that?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Katiya laughs. &quot;Of course not. I can tell. Despite all the tomboy stuff, I&apos;m a woman like her, you know,&quot; she says. &quot;She only had one condition, though.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;She wants to be my friend. Says &apos;friends are hard to come by at this age.&apos; And then she asked for my number.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I pass the gate, waving to the guard whose name I should know by this point. &quot;So what did you say?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I said I left it at home. Then she gave me a sticky page from her purse instead.&quot; She holds up a sticky note with flowery girl handwriting on it. &quot;So what do I do now?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;We get you a phone,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Take it as a token of my thanks.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But won&apos;t I get addicted to it? Like the children of your world and their cat movies?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.22.4.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;You can leave it at my place, or whatever. I don&apos;t care,&quot; I say, adding the phone store as another stop on the way home. &quot;You can even get a basic one, without all the brain-rot stuff. I&apos;ll show you how to use it.&quot;</p>",

      "<p>&emsp;Kei laughs, crossing her legs as she sits across from me in the train car. &quot;So you didn&apos;t realize that this is exactly the same date we went on all those years ago?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;So it is a date, I think, rubbing the stubble on my chin that I shaved for the first time in months. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess not,&quot; I say. &quot;I mean, the last one with you was probably the last real date I&apos;ve been on.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Real one, huh?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She leans in closer, showing that same mischievous grin that comes when she&apos;s trying to gaslight me. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;And what makes it real?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, tell me,&quot; she says, leaning even closer, just as a voice chimes over the intercom, declaring we&apos;re at the first stop in Hearthland Ridge on Mineral Street. </p><p>&emsp;The train car lurches to motion, and with her sweaty palms slipping against her bare thighs, her face crashes straight into my chest.</p><p>&emsp;But my mind is quick. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s because we just got here and you&apos;re already throwing yourself at me.&quot; I gently lift Kei up by her shoulders: despite my courageous words, I&apos;m more afraid that she&apos;ll sense the swiftness of my heartbeat, and how badly I&apos;m afraid of fucking this up.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, don&apos;t be so sure,&quot; she says. Her face flushes. &quot;I bought us the tickets, but that&apos;s only because I make big money compared to you!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My mind is fast at this performance. I wonder when I stopped feeling the humor in the words. &quot;And you&apos;ll probably spend every last red cent of it on this date.&quot;  I find a smile. &quot;What is it? Another hundred dollars more than me?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Who said this was a date?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please,&quot; I say. &quot;You said that, like, four sentences ago.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. I guess I did.&quot; She brushes several rebellious strands of her dense, dark hair behind her left ear. </p><p>&emsp;We fix our eyes on the distant mountainscape. It&apos;s the only fixed point when residential houses, rusted refuse, and reckless weeds tear past us at a blistering speed. The only place we&apos;re allowed to look when too much eye contact with anyone on this train might mean a fight, or an impromptu Sunday sermon.</p><p>&emsp;But despite the courage it took to come back here, it feels like no time has passed. It&apos;s not just because she&apos;s wearing the same white-and-blue summer dress she wore all those summers ago. Nor is it because she&apos;s wearing the same perfume. I assume those two things are just because she&apos;s living at home with her parents, not because she&apos;s trying to imply something.</p><p>&emsp;Or is she? </p><p>&emsp;No . . . I refuse to make that same mistake again. But I can feel the excitement of that anticipation as I watch her there, trying not to notice the curvature of her breasts change with each jostle of the cabin, nor the slenderness of her smooth legs lightly damp with sweat from a blistering June day. Not letting that animalistic side that wishes to skip all this overtake what I&apos;m searching for &mdash; the one track of feeling that I&apos;m afraid I lost.</p><p>&emsp;I try to notice if I notice anything that might show I still feel that way about her. Or that I still have it in me to feel about anyone. I try to remember when I almost said that four-letter word to her, right on the same platform where we boarded this train, before fear and diminishing time sealed that path off from me for years. </p><p>&emsp;But that feeling isn&apos;t something you search for. It happens to you. It&apos;s a place you only realize once you&apos;re there, and I swear to God I have the emotional receipts to prove I was there.</p><p>&emsp;Our view of the Rocky Mountains is shaded by one of those big law firm ads that wraps around the train car, like looking through those bug-resistant screens that pixelate everything into a disparate spread of dots. Looking at the mountains makes me wonder how Katiya&apos;s date is going, hoping that she finds all the things she missed inside of Jullian. The silhouette of an image overshadows the entire car through the windows, but I can&apos;t see the full picture. I spend more time looking at how beautiful Kei is, accented with dots like the shading in a comic book, how little she&apos;s changed since the last time we were here, and wonder how much I&apos;ve changed in ways that I don&apos;t even realize.</p><p>&emsp;I do small talk. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;These windows are scratched to hell, huh?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot; She asks, distracted like she is when I approach her with redlines, still mesmerized by the way everything tears past us.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The windows. I thought I remembered the Denver Light Rail being a lot cleaner.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Was it ever clean?&quot; She turns to me with her sapphire eyes. &quot;Cleaning this system up is like sculpting dry sand.&quot; And I realize this small talk is getting me nowhere.</p><p>&emsp;I feel that mindless feeling rise within me, dragging me closer to her. She leaned that far earlier for a reason. She&apos;s wearing this dress and that perfume for a reason. Maybe she meant to fall like that. </p><p>&emsp;Or maybe she didn&apos;t. </p><p>&emsp;And yet all I want is to just make a move.</p><p>&emsp;I look weird now, the way I&apos;m bent over so far.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You drop something?&quot; Kei asks.</p><p>&emsp;My heart seizes, still absorbed in her words from a day before. &quot;No, I just . . .&quot; and then I feel my body move in an act of fear, finding myself right next to her on the two-seater with our legs pressed together.</p><p>&emsp;Her skin is so pleasantly cool. The smell of her is overwhelming, and I feel that same part that led me to all those meaningless hook-ups in college urge me to move a little closer.</p><p>&emsp;But she&apos;s my colleague, I think. Didn&apos;t you learn last time that she doesn&apos;t see things that way?</p><p>&emsp;She&apos;s not moving away, keeping her position either because I made her vastly uncomfortable and she&apos;s stuck with me now, or because she&apos;s interested.</p><p>&emsp;But I don&apos;t want to assume. I don&apos;t want to lean on hope again.</p><p>&emsp;Her voice is warm. &quot;Took you long enough,&quot; she says, &quot;so is it realer now?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; I say. The feeling engulfs me after all these lonely years. I venture my hand on her leg, and she returns by placing her hand on top of mine, leaning close so I can feel even more of her. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess we&apos;re right back where we started now, right? And yet you couldn&apos;t even ask on your own.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, what can I say? You&apos;re a lot of things I like. You still make me hella nervous.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hella nervous? I can tell,&quot; she says, feeling a slight tremble in my hand. &quot;Is it still stressful dating an upperclassmen?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s no grades here anymore,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You could have asked sooner. Like in college, maybe.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But we were both out and around. It seemed like we were chasing a different experience. And neither of us was ready to come down to earth, you know?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;There&apos;s a part of me that yearns to break with all the darkness of those years. Meaningless hook-ups, lonely nights when my sorrow almost set me over the edge, and even though I long to relish the comfort of this exact moment, I&apos;m so afraid of showing it. I&apos;m afraid this feeling isn&apos;t what I want it to be, losing grasp of my ability to judge, falling headlong into that hedonistic sense of longing.</p><p>&emsp;And so I press my lips against hers to try to remember again.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;And so I press my lips against his to try to forget.</p><p>&emsp;The feeling has hunted me since we left Gaffesend in the carriage. It seems to trail every time that Jullian and I get together. It builds with the crescendo of all the unspoken questions: the useless questions that get us nowhere; the useless, pathetic questions that drive a larger wedge between us, preventing us from just enjoying things the way they are.</p><p>&emsp;What more can I want?</p><p>&emsp;The driver of this personal carriage is distracted by the noise of the horses. It&apos;s surely not his business to care, anyways: just to focus on our safe  passage from the Knights&apos; Quarter of Gaffesend to the day spa in the springs. And as the carriage jostles us around on uneven terrain, I grab his shirt to pull him closer, stabilizing the two of us while the rest of the world trembles.</p><p>&emsp;I speak with my lips against his for every question that crosses my mind. The nostalgia of this love brings me back to the better times, when all we had to do was study, and not to serve our sentence on the brink of war. He tastes the same way he did all those years ago. And when I shift seats to sit next to him on the two-seater, with our legs pressed together, I find his skin so pleasantly warm, contrasting the cold of the alpine air.</p><p>&emsp;The smell of his musk is overwhelming: the Jullian smell in all the shirts he left behind. I feel that same part that led me to all those passionate nights in school urge me to move a little closer.</p><p>&emsp;But does he still feel that way? I ask. Why did he set this up for us?</p><p>&emsp;That same fear that keeps me from the scouting quests rhymes with the anxiety I feel now. I wonder if his kisses are just performative, because every time I pull away to collect my breath, it seems as if he wants to stop.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s wrong?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just trying to breathe,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s because we just got in here, and you&apos;re already throwing yourself at me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because you&apos;re my boyfriend?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He glances nervously at the coachman right behind us. &quot;I&apos;m kidding,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because he&apos;s surely paid to care,&quot; I say. &quot;How many Uber drivers&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uber?&quot; He asks. And I realize I&apos;m reciting the most recent thing I learned about Cody&apos;s world.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I mean, how many OTHER drivers care about that? I&apos;ll bet you half the people they chaperone in small carriages like this  are couples. No storage on the top: most certainly unable to move a family. Designed for just a group of friends, or two lovers, on a day trip.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;And, pray tell, which of those describes us? I think, but I shake my head.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I hope a carriage is enough. I was gonna get one of those new touring cars with the motor . . . but I ended up spending most of it on the spa.&quot; Jullian smiles. &quot;You know I want to treat you right.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Now you do, I think. &quot;What made you change?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Change what?&quot; He still smiles.</p><p>&emsp;Shit.</p><p>&emsp;My mind races for something I can actually say. &quot;Well, it just came out of nowhere, you know.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;His face falls, still begging the question I refuse to answer. &quot;Change what, Katiya?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s . . . nothing,&quot; I claim, retreating to the edge of the narrow bench.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s&mdash;&quot; he looks to the coachman again. Then he lowers his voice. &quot;It&apos;s something that bothers you. That matters.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, we&apos;ve already talked about it before,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know. And I paid for this whole trip for you,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You paid for it? So money just makes up for . . .&quot; I clench my fists, hating the entrapment of this state more than how he hurts me, sometimes, so I do the same thing I always do.</p><p>&emsp;I clear my throat, and the cowardice speaks for me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; I tell him. &quot;This will be a great trip. I&apos;m excited. And I&apos;m sorry if I come off as ungrateful,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;He turns my chin up with his fingers to look at him. &quot;I accept your apology. And I&apos;m sorry, too.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;For what?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;For . . . all of it,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;Like what? I think again, making sure not to say it this time. &quot;Let&apos;s just return to that wonderful part where we were enjoying our time off,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;m glad we can do this together.&quot;</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m glad we could do this together,&quot; Kei says. &quot;After all these years.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;And I realize our entire date has passed in a blur.</p><p>&emsp;We sit downtown at some sushi restaurant on 16th Street Mall. I said all the funny things at all the right times. I made sure to drink as much as I could when we went bowling, to loosen up a little, because even if alcohol makes me feel the call of the void the day after, I need to steal that emotional currency from my future self.</p><p>&emsp;Fact is that we walked into most of the stores, finding myself thinking what Katiya might choose. I chose an outfit for Kei, and she chose a funny work shirt for me.</p><p>&emsp;Fact is that we went bowling. Last time she beat me with her perfect technique, and just as she was about to beat me again, I gave up on trying to win, spinning the twelve-pounder with only two of my fingers in the holes. She laughed at my gutter balls, and when we played a round with the guards up, I wondered how Katiya would fair in a bowling match.</p><p>&emsp;The fact is that she kissed me when I paid for the game. She laughed when I said I scraped together my &quot;level-one poverty dollars for this special date,&quot; and badgered me over whether choosing sushi had to do with her ethnicity.</p><p>&emsp;Is this love, then?</p><p>&emsp;Two glasses of Soju in before the volcano rolls, I ask: &quot;So what&apos;s your favorite date we&apos;ve been on?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She mixes wasabi with soy in hungry anticipation. &quot;Honestly? I think the best times have just been talking to you. Whether it was at your parents&apos; house after class. Or any dinner date.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What can I say? My voice is mesmerizing,&quot; I say, then recite a canned one-liner. &quot;People always told me I had a face for radio. Or was it voice? I don&apos;t remember.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d say both, if I liked you enough to date you. And even now, as ragged as you still look.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I retreat to memories of the past. &quot;You remember when your family took me to sushi back in middle school?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She cracks up when the image hits of me skewering the rolls with chopsticks like meats on a kabob. &quot;How the hell did you think that was the right thing to do?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I say. &quot;I honestly think I was just trying to make you laugh.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You always make me laugh,&quot; she says, but her eyes narrow. &quot;But, I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s felt like there&apos;s something different now.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I take another sip of the rice wine. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just . . . well, never mind. I don&apos;t want to get all serious.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I say, still flashing a smile. &quot;It&apos;s alright.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well,&quot; She hesitates, but after another sip, finds it in her to finish. &quot;You know, ever since what happened. I&apos;ve just felt this kind of sadness in you. Even when you laugh sometimes &mdash; and I&apos;m not saying you don&apos;t laugh sincerely.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My face falls. I guess we&apos;re doing this after all. &quot;I mean, it still affects me. But I&apos;m over all that. Life moves on.&quot; I gesture the &apos;moving on&apos; with my hands,  convincingly, nearly knocking over the bottle.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s just a pain there that saddens me.&quot; She sips again on her third glass since we don&apos;t have to drive for a while.</p><p>&emsp;I laugh. &quot;What kind of fortune cookie shit is that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But really,&quot; she says. </p><p>&emsp;And then a little bit, just a little bit &mdash; I scoop into that emptiness just to draw out a little bit. Not too much, or it might break me. Not too little, or it won&apos;t sell.</p><p>&emsp;I start, &quot;There was a time I felt so alive after it all went down. With that project I did in Jackson&apos;s name, you know, back in college. It felt like I was processing it, I was working through it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But then what happened?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know. Then, I guess, the two quarters were up, and so was Senior Design. School was over, along with the drive, and now it collects dust in my garage.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She pauses, having known me long enough to have the courage to ask me further. &quot;But, was it enough?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My insides cramp. &quot;Of course. After the news report. The presentation. I shared his story. Hero for a day, or whatever.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; she says. She looks out the high windows of the sunken, subterranean restaurant where many random footsteps pass outside. I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ve convinced her. And I&apos;m not sure I have it in me to try. </p><p>&emsp;I fight that stupid feeling again that I buried for so damn long: either I had one too many, or scooped out a little too much of myself. But I don&apos;t trust her to catch me, afraid that if I fall, that I&apos;ll fall apart completely. </p><p>&emsp;So I pack it in, smile, and add, &quot;But that past is over.&quot; Because it is. &quot;And my brother Jackie would want me to live on. I have to live enough for the both of us!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;But do I really have that spark left? Is she right? I wove this connection between Katiya and I &mdash; I mean, Kei and I, when I had that passion, but that weaving feels like a forgotten craft. All I have left are just the relics from that time that feel foreign to me: a song I forgot how to play, and all I know now is just how to improvise over it.</p><p>&emsp;I feel so drained of energy now, even dizzy. I anticipate those basic-bitch California rolls to absorb all the alcohol in my empty stomach, and I find I&apos;m thinking of Katiya again, wondering what she&apos;s doing. It breaks my focus, causing my words to trail off as I grit my teeth and continue to recite even more of our past.</p>"

        "<p id=\"2.23.1.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My mind is fast at this performance. I wonder when I stopped feeling the humor in the words. &quot;And you&apos;ll probably spend every last red cent of it on this date.&quot;  I find a smile. &quot;What is it? Another hundred dollars more than me?&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.23.1.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But despite the courage it took to come back here, it feels like no time has passed. It&apos;s not just because she&apos;s wearing the same white-and-blue summer dress she wore all those summers ago. Nor is it because she&apos;s wearing the same perfume. I assume those two things are just because she&apos;s living at home with her parents, not because she&apos;s trying to imply something.</p>",

But I can feel the excitement of that anticipation as I watch her there, trying not to notice the curvature of her breasts change with each jostle of the cabin, nor the slenderness of her smooth legs lightly damp with sweat from a blistering June day. Not letting that animalistic side that wishes to skip all this overtake what I&apos;m searching for &mdash; the one track of feeling that I&apos;m afraid I lost.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.23.1.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But that feeling isn&apos;t something you search for. It happens to you. It&apos;s a place you only realize once you&apos;re there, and I swear to God I have the emotional receipts to prove I was there.</p>",

Looking at the mountains makes me wonder how Katiya&apos;s date is going, hoping that she finds all the things she missed inside of Jullian. The silhouette of an image overshadows the entire car through the windows, but I can&apos;t see the full picture. I spend more time looking at how beautiful Kei is, accented with dots like the shading in a comic book, how little she&apos;s changed since the last time we were here, and wonder how much I&apos;ve changed in ways that I don&apos;t even realize.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.23.1.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I feel that mindless feeling rise within me, dragging me closer to her. She leaned that far earlier for a reason. She&apos;s wearing this dress and that perfume for a reason. Maybe she meant to fall like that. </p>",

        "<p id=\"2.23.1.45\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But we were both out and around. It seemed like we were chasing a different experience. And neither of us was ready to come down to earth, you know?&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.1.46\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;There&apos;s a part of me that yearns to break with all the darkness of those years. Meaningless hook-ups, lonely nights when my sorrow almost set me over the edge, and even though I long to relish the comfort of this exact moment, I&apos;m so afraid of showing it. I&apos;m afraid this feeling isn&apos;t what I want it to be, losing grasp of my ability to judge, falling headlong into that hedonistic sense of longing.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.23.3.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I say, still flashing a smile. &quot;It&apos;s alright.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Well,&quot; She hesitates, but after another sip, finds it in her to finish. &quot;You know, ever since what happened. I&apos;ve just felt this kind of sadness in you. Even when you laugh sometimes &mdash; and I&apos;m not saying you don&apos;t laugh sincerely.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My face falls. I guess we&apos;re doing this after all. &quot;I mean, it still affects me. But I&apos;m over all that. Life moves on.&quot; I gesture the &apos;moving on&apos; with my hands,  convincingly, nearly knocking over the bottle.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s just a pain there that saddens me.&quot; She sips again on her third glass since we don&apos;t have to drive for a while.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I laugh. &quot;What kind of fortune cookie shit is that?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.23\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But really,&quot; she says. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;And then a little bit, just a little bit &mdash; I scoop into that emptiness just to draw out a little bit. Not too much, or it might break me. Not too little, or it won&apos;t sell.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I start, &quot;There was a time I felt so alive after it all went down. With that project I did in Jackson&apos;s name, you know, back in college. It felt like I was processing it, I was working through it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;But then what happened?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know. Then, I guess, the two quarters were up, and so was Senior Design. School was over, along with the drive, and now it collects dust in my garage.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She pauses, having known me long enough to have the courage to ask me further. &quot;But, was it enough?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My insides cramp. &quot;Of course. After the news report. The presentation. I shared his story. Hero for a day, or whatever.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; she says. She looks out the high windows of the sunken, subterranean restaurant where many random footsteps pass outside. I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ve convinced her. And I&apos;m not sure I have it in me to try. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.31\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I fight that stupid feeling again that I buried for so damn long: either I had one too many, or scooped out a little too much of myself. But I don&apos;t trust her to catch me, afraid that if I fall, that I&apos;ll fall apart completely. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.32\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;So I pack it in, smile, and add, &quot;But that past is over.&quot; Because it is. &quot;And my brother Jackie would want me to live on. I have to live enough for the both of us!&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.33\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;But do I really have that spark left? Is she right? I wove this connection between Katiya and I &mdash; I mean, Kei and I, when I had that passion, but that weaving feels like a forgotten craft. All I have left are just the relics from that time that feel foreign to me: a song I forgot how to play, and all I know now is just how to improvise over it.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.23.3.34\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I feel so drained of energy now, even dizzy. I anticipate those basic-bitch California rolls to absorb all the alcohol in my empty stomach, and I find I&apos;m thinking of Katiya again, wondering what she&apos;s doing. It breaks my focus, causing my words to trail off as I grit my teeth and continue to recite even more of our past.</p>"

      "<p>&emsp;I grit my teeth and continue to descend into the cold tub. My body aches, but not yet from the freezing water. It&apos;s from the pain of how heavy-handed those backwater Ahkvasans are &mdash; digging their manicured claws into the thinnest muscles on our backs, extracting pain from our overworked muscles by dealing it. And now I&apos;m tasked to withstand the freezing water for a couple minutes, because it&apos;s supposedly good for me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No Essence,&quot; Jullian says, seemingly humored by my suffering as he recovers in the warm tub. &quot;I didn&apos;t do it with Essence. No cheating!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What, you think I&apos;m a cheater?&quot; I ask. The ache seeps into my bones, as if my marrow is infected with the Chymaeran Curse. </p><p>&emsp;My face twitches. </p><p>&emsp;I ask, &quot;and how long did you say this was for?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Five minutes,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;I tremble as gooseflesh spreads like a rash, feeling parts of my body contract that are beyond my control. &quot;Well, talk to me about something. I talked to you, didn&apos;t I?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Aren&apos;t we kind of out of things to talk about?&quot; He says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about the,&quot; my teeth chatter, &quot;how about how pointless this place is for people like us?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He laughs. &quot;Just because you hate the cold tub&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. Not the Gods-damn cold tub. I mean &mdash; can&apos;t anything be made a warm tub with our abilities? We could get in the bath at home and heat it in seconds.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But what about the nature?&quot; Jullian says, spreading his arms as he gestures to the open-air naked bath. &quot;What about the trip? Getting a little ways out of Gaffesend? The water has special properties. They say it heals you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We can heal ourselves, too, you know.&quot; I tense my jaw shut to stop that Gods-awful sound of bone-on-bone.</p><p>&emsp;He smirks. &quot;Sounds like you don&apos;t like this date.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I do. All that doesn&apos;t mean this isn&apos;t nice. It&apos;s pain, just like every day. But it&apos;s good pain. Pain that&apos;s for you, you know?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;For you?&quot; He asks. &quot;Isn&apos;t all pain for the person in pain?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, but pain that makes you better. Half the pain of our training is just lifting stuff all day, or walking laps around the border. But this is to make you feel better later.&quot; My arms tighten around each other as I shiver. &quot;Or it&apos;s supposed to. Right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sounds to me like your brain is starting to freeze,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe you should get out. And admit you&apos;re weaker than me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Or maybe you should admit you&apos;re bad at distracting me! Make me feel better,&quot; I say. &quot;Relax me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not getting in there with you,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then talk about . . . the future,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What about it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;About us. About what happens after all of this. After the trials, after probation and all.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I expect his face to warm a little. Maybe from the thought of us living together and depending on each other like we planned, and I want to warm my spirit on that while my body freezes. But he hardly seems to give it a thought.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know, haven&apos;t really thought about it,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m more focused on what&apos;s happening right now.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But really, though,&quot; I say. &quot;You haven&apos;t thought about any of it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I think I&apos;m already in the future I wanted,&quot; he says. &quot;And I hope tomorrow is just a continuation of that. Just the prospect of being free is enough: from all those awful years I never had the freedom to do anything. School, then training, then taking care of my brothers. Sleep for a while. Then repeat it all over again,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You met me in those years,&quot; I say, losing the feeling of ice.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. I mean, of course,&quot; he says. &quot;And you saved me from doing that forever. Could you imagine our lives if we weren&apos;t free like this? Boyhood was something I never had. And surely you&apos;d admit that you didn&apos;t have a childhood either.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I had a piece of one,&quot; I say. &quot;But what we have now is control. To steer our lives somewhere better. That after all the hard work and delayed gratification, we can reach something and call it ours. That thing we both wanted, remember?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I remember.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Then I decide to test him. &quot;And what was it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Settling down once we&apos;re on the other side. After our service.&quot; He sounds like a child reciting chores. Then he opens his mouth to modify that statement, but he pauses.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But what?&quot; I ask. &quot;What&apos;s changed?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nothing&apos;s changed. It&apos;s just&mdash;&quot; he starts, then lets out a long sigh. &quot;I remember being the oldest after both my brothers were born. And I remember school as the only time I had to enjoy myself. And my friends: Gavin and Auren, and how they&apos;d keep inviting me to things, again and again, turning them down every time since I had to walk home and pick up my stupid siblings and feed them. While they got girlfriends, and they forgot about me, and got new friends, and . . .&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Jullian clenches his fist and drives it into the water, but it doesn&apos;t launch a plume of hot water. His fist sizzles, sending clouds of water vapor to join the miasmic haze that hovers over the pools. </p><p>&emsp;He says, &quot;you remember the Harvest Festival before we left, I&apos;m sure.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course. The last real fun we had back there,&quot; I say. &quot;Just the two of us, walking between booths.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That was the first festival I&apos;ve ever been to. And it just . . . gave me a taste of something. Like having sugar for the first time at age twenty.&quot; I feel like he wants me to extrapolate the meaning, but I don&apos;t get it. &quot;Like &mdash; is it so wrong?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Is what so wrong?&quot; I ask. &quot;You&apos;re not being specific, Jullian.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So wrong to wish for something.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;To wish for what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;To wish my father never died in the mining accident: to knock up my mother and leave me to care for them. Or to wish they were never born, and I could have enjoyed my life. Or if I can&apos;t go back there, then to change the present.&quot; But then he stops himself in his moment of passion. He recoils, frightened of his true nature for just a moment until his expression glazes over. &quot;Nevermind,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. Finish the thought,&quot; I say, losing sense of the freezing water. &quot;What is it you wish for?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;For nothing,&quot; he insists. I can feel the anger and disappointment of all these months flood through me, but it can&apos;t come out of my mouth. I&apos;m choking on it, like holding back the urge to vomit: the thought of the something that comes after those final words. It&apos;s the thought of oblivion. That with how things are going at training, that I&apos;m headed for death anyways. That I don&apos;t have the time or the temerity or the looks or the emotional energy, and with all that fear, all I can do is keep holding it here.</p><p>&emsp;I bite my tongue until I think it bleeds, shutting my eyes as I fail to recognize what it does to me. He rattles off with some reason he found the time to make up, and as the panic makes me sweat like those sleepless nights in the dream of the cabin, I can feel the fingers closing in on me, surrounding my body with scentless smoke.</p><p>&emsp;But it isn&apos;t smoke. </p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s steam.</p><p>&emsp;And then I breathe it in.</p><p>&emsp;I think of things that rest me, but nothing works. The morning runs. The view from my house in the evenings. The love we had when I was building him up. And only when another man&apos;s face crosses my mind &mdash; that smug face of the outsider when he insults me, but in a friendly way; the expression he wears when he&apos;s deep in focus; the way his forearms fill the space in his shirt when he rolls his sleeves &mdash; the thought of Cody gives me a sense of control, of resistance. </p><p>&emsp;And so I open my eyes to find the water no longer at my shoulders. It boils beneath me as I sit here tucked in a ball, wondering how much longer I have to savor this mediocrity before I&apos;m sent off to die.</p><p>&emsp;I rise from the tub, covering my breasts with my arm as Jullian&apos;s eyes snare on something in the distance, too much of a coward to turn and face me, or even himself. </p><p>&emsp;But maybe that similarity makes us perfect for each other. </p><p>&emsp;I rush to the changing room as Jullian just sits there, without the strength to follow.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I have just enough strength to lead us: after all, I&apos;m the only one whose liver was trained for endurance in the fraternity house.</p><p>&emsp;It feels like I have a knot in my stomach, wondering if all those sushi rolls expanded from the liquor &mdash; like the time Jackson swallowed those &quot;Just Add Water&quot; dinosaur toy pills from the dollar store. The doctor pulled them out of his throat like a rope of colorful ribbons from the mouth of a clown. But I feel like mine will be able to come out all on their own.</p>I clutch my stomach as we stumble along 16th Street, looking no different from all the other late-evening pedestrians. Kei tensions her arm in mine, and deprived of all the energy I borrowed from tomorrow, I find I just want to go home.",
      "<p>&emsp;&quot;I just want to go home,&quot; I tell Jullian, as soon as I exit the locker room.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But we have a whole night here,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m not sure I can get a refund.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;But I&apos;m already headed for the front of the complex, carrying my towel and overnight bag.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya, wait!&quot; He says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And where was all that enthusiasm earlier?&quot; My hand tensions further around the straps of the bag as I turn to face him, something he&apos;s obviously incapable of. &quot;If you&apos;re so damn interested in changing the present, why don&apos;t we do it now?&quot; I yell.</p><p>&emsp;He looks around nervously, watching as other couples begin to turn their heads.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh no, poor Jullian. He longs so much to be the center of attention, but not like this! He wants to have fun. To make up for all those wasted years by deserting the one person who&apos;s supported him through it all, is that right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; he mutters, shambling after me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then you better convince me,&quot; I say. &quot;You want to stay and finish your spa day? Or are you going to follow me, and prove something you&apos;ve failed at since we got here?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re embarrassing me,&quot; he says. I see an anger build inside him: a stupid, pathetic, unfounded anger that has no right to be here.</p><p>&emsp;I turn and approach him. I stand inches from his face though I have to look up at him. &quot;What was that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You embarrass me,&quot; he says. &quot;You continue to embarrass me. You put me down and make me feel like I&apos;m the bad one here, but do you know how much energy it takes to be with you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Excuse me?&quot; I could strike him across the Gods-damn face if this weren&apos;t a public bout. I feel my fear losing its edge on the anger that&apos;s built over the course of months. &quot;And do you know how much energy I waste on hope that you can still be a good person?&quot;</p>&quot;You have enough to try dragging me running every other day. You want me to stick around every morning. To spend all my free time with you. And do you know how much it takes to defend dating a failure?&quot;",
      "<p>&emsp;Something in me twists at that word. Something that I haven&apos;t felt for a long time, and after all the events of the evening, I&apos;m losing control of that edge.</p><p>&emsp;Surely it&apos;s the booze from the way the tears leak from my eyes a little, but the train car back is dark, and when I press my nose to the scratched window glass, feeling the vibrations of the rails, I feel that feeling steady itself just a little more.</p><p>&emsp;But the more it settles, the more distance I feel between the two of us, though she leans right against me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I mean, look at us,&quot; Kei says. &quot;Don&apos;t you see it? Late twenties. Too tired to care about anything. We&apos;re two sides of the same coin.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You really think that&apos;s all we are?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I stay at work because I want time to pass, if I feel like I can&apos;t make any use of it. And you&apos;re what the shop guys call the &apos;eighter-skater.&apos; But, like me, I bet you&apos;re just so unsure of what to do with all that time when you lack the energy to put behind it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;To waste my time as efficiently as possible,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Where&apos;d you get that idiom?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;I think of the long years sitting at the window, watching time go by. The hum of the rusted fan like the screech of this train. The smell of summer somewhere beyond the walls of the office. &quot;Just something I thought of, once.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She sniffles as she leans further against my shoulder. &quot;Heh. I guess I&apos;m just a whore for what I can&apos;t seem to produce on my own.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m a mosquito, or some lame pest. Drawn to blood, to energy. It&apos;s why I was so drawn to you. You have this spark when your eyes light up and you&apos;re really passionate about something: debates in Student Government that got us the win; designing that Senior Project was the last time I saw it,&quot; she says, and she looks up at me with her bright blue eyes, and I&apos;d cry if I wasn&apos;t so good at controlling it.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I&apos;m tapped out now. Maybe you sucked every last ounce out of me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She wipes her eyes. She laughs. &quot;If only you were one grade older. If only my parents gave me that extra year in preschool to stay close in age with other kids. That summer with you would have been great.&quot;</p>&quot;I think of that last month of ours all the time,&quot; I say, and I approach to kiss her, knowing that though our lips touch &mdash; and that this dulled feeling of lust is still there somewhere &mdash; we&apos;ll never truly fit, seeking the exact same shape of that piece we can&apos;t find in each other.",
      "<p>&emsp;And maybe that peace was never there. Maybe he was always longing for something and just used me as a rope to climb out.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We were both losers when we met,&quot; I say. &quot;We lifted each other up!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But I was able to get over my fears. You still cower in them every day,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;Not going on a single patrol quest? Have you even looked at the status board lately? Have you trained combat in any drop-ins? Have you even been inside the base?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, I haven&apos;t,&quot; I say. &quot;But did you think you had it in you to be a Guard? And did I not show you the patience when you were insecure and antisocial? Or am I the only one with patience?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve been patient for months,&quot; Jullian says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And I was patient for years. Maybe I&apos;ve been waiting for too long,&quot; I say. I pick up the bag and head for the exit. Gods above know I don&apos;t care how long it takes to get a damn ride.</p><p>&emsp;He follows, pathetically. &quot;Then what are we, Katiya?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You tell me,&quot; I say. &quot;You brought me here for something. Maybe your friends told you it would fix everything that women are simple and just need a date every so often to shut us up for a while.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, no. And &mdash; and, I&apos;m sorry for what I said.&quot; He reaches for my shoulder as I walk. &quot;You&apos;re not a loser. You&apos;re not damaged, either. You&apos;re just . . . wounded in a different way, and to a different extent than I am.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He thinks I&apos;ll forgive him. That this is just another episode. But it&apos;s not.</p><p>&emsp;And I say the words I fear.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then maybe I should heal alone, if you&apos;re not going to stay without me asking. Maybe I&apos;ll heal faster if I don&apos;t keep getting hurt by your neglect.&quot; I find a carriage waiting, as if divined by the will of the Gods &mdash; or the fact that nobody in their right mind would leave on a half-day at the DAY spa. I reach into my purse for a hefty chunk of Kine.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then give me one last chance,&quot; he says. &quot;To be patient. Because I need to do better.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I sit in the back of the carriage. My hand motions to the driver&apos;s open palm, but Jullian beats me to it, dispensing the fare as he sits across from me.</p><p>&emsp;And for some reason, I don&apos;t say anything at all: nothing for the rest of the ride home. That is, until he follows me into my house though I refused to kiss him goodnight, finding something unexpected in the foyer of my home.</p>",
      "<p>&emsp;I still don&apos;t feel like I ever left Gaffesend. I feel far tenser than when I left, and I don&apos;t think that this time is because of that awful argument.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya?&quot; Kei asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody,&quot; Jullian says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Kei,&quot; I reply.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Jullian,&quot; Cody responds.</p><p>&emsp;Cody pulls his pants up right before Jullian can see his undergarments. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sorry to intrude,&quot; Kei says, stumbling across the floor. &quot;I thought Cody&apos;s house had more to it &mdash; first time I&apos;ve been over, but what the hell is up with this?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s hell?&quot; Jullian asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s up with what?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;With this doorway,&quot; Kei says. &quot;Was this complex of townhomes designed by a Motel-8 or something, with adjoining doors like this?&quot; She adjusts her twisted bra.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What the Res is a model eight?&quot; Jullian asks again.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What the hell is a &apos;Res&apos;?&quot; Kei asks.</p><p>&emsp;My eyes glare at Cody. </p><p>&emsp;How in Khiras&apos; name did you let this happen? </p><p>&emsp;But he looks confused.</p><p>&emsp;She opened the damn door, he seems to imply.</p><p>&emsp;My eyes gesture to the door as we watch oil mix with water: putting out one fire at a time. My mind screams in false telepathy, hoping his science brain can logically piece it together. You&apos;re lucky Kei came over here. It would be too much for Jullian to see your side!</p><p>&emsp;His eyes parse between Jullian and I. Let&apos;s keep him away, he hopefully implies, just as Jullian turns to me. &quot;You never told me that . . . guy . . . lived next door to you,&quot; he says. &quot;And through a connecting door? Not even my house has that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m surprised you guys live so close,&quot; Kei says. &quot;Never seen a builder&apos;s package with a door between townhomes.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The gears turn in Cody&apos;s mind. &quot;Must have been for multi-family situations or something,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;Kei steps a little further in, and the three of us approach her like pawns on a chessboard, afraid she might castle us. &quot;Speaking of builders&apos; packages, isn&apos;t this place new? And how did you get it to look like this?&quot; She says, now noticing the strangeness of their attire.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And what are you two wearing?&quot; Jullian asks. &quot;Are you Royals? Living in this district? I know Master Cody is a scientist.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Scientist,&quot; Kei repeats, chuckling without recognizing the danger she incites. &quot;I guess an engineer is a scientist. We&apos;re both engineers at Navidson-Monroe.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not familiar with that family,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;Hyphenated must mean some drama&apos;s in there. Anyways &mdash; so you&apos;re a couple in the science guild. Katiya is my paramour, and we&apos;re together in the Royal Knights.&quot; It looks like some kind of relief comes to him when he sees Cody as even less of a threat.</p><p>&emsp;Kei uses everything she has to not double over laughing. Probably seeing us as some of those cause-players Cody talked about.

And my friends: Gavin and Auren, and how they&apos;d keep inviting me to things, again and again, turning them down every time since I had to walk home and pick up my stupid siblings and feed them.

        "<p id=\"2.24.1.39\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;That was the first festival I&apos;ve ever been to. And it just . . . gave me a taste of something.

        "<p id=\"2.24.1.40\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Is what so wrong?&quot; I ask. &quot;You&apos;re not being specific, Jullian.&quot;</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.24.1.43\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;To wish my father never died in the mining accident: to knock up my mother and leave me to care for them. Or to wish they were never born, and I could have enjoyed my life. Or if I can&apos;t go back there, then to change the present.&quot; But then he stops himself in his moment of passion. He recoils, frightened of his true nature for just a moment until his expression glazes over. &quot;Nevermind,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.1.44\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;No. Finish the thought,&quot; I say, losing sense of the freezing water. &quot;What is it you wish for?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.1.45\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;For nothing,&quot; he insists. I can feel the anger and disappointment of all these months flood through me, but it can&apos;t come out of my mouth. I&apos;m choking on it, like holding back the urge to vomit: the thought of the something that comes after those final words. It&apos;s the thought of oblivion. That with how things are going at training, that I&apos;m headed for death anyways. That I don&apos;t have the time or the temerity or the looks or the emotional energy, and with all that fear, all I can do is keep holding it here.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.1.46\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I bite my tongue until I think it bleeds, shutting my eyes as I fail to recognize what it does to me. He rattles off with some reason he found the time to make up, and as the panic makes me sweat like those sleepless nights in the dream of the cabin, I can feel the fingers closing in on me, surrounding my body with scentless smoke.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.24.1.50\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;I think of things that rest me, but nothing works. The morning runs. The view from my house in the evenings. The love we had when I was building him up. And only when another man&apos;s face crosses my mind &mdash; that smug face of the outsider when he insults me, but in a friendly way; the expression he wears when he&apos;s deep in focus; the way his forearms fill the space in his shirt when he rolls his sleeves &mdash; the thought of Cody gives me a sense of control, of resistance. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.1.51\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;And so I open my eyes to find the water no longer at my shoulders. It boils beneath me as I sit here tucked in a ball, wondering how much longer I have to savor this mediocrity before I&apos;m sent off to die.</p>",

        "<p id=\"2.24.6.5\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Jullian,&quot; Cody responds.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.6\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Cody pulls his pants up right before Jullian can see his undergarments. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.7\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Sorry to intrude,&quot; Kei says, stumbling across the floor. &quot;I thought Cody&apos;s house had more to it &mdash; first time I&apos;ve been over, but what the hell is up with this?&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.8\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s hell?&quot; Jullian asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.9\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s up with what?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.10\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;With this doorway,&quot; Kei says. &quot;Was this complex of townhomes designed by a Motel-8 or something, with adjoining doors like this?&quot; She adjusts her twisted bra.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.11\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What the Res is a model eight?&quot; Jullian asks again.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.12\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What the hell is a &apos;Res&apos;?&quot; Kei asks.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.13\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My eyes glare at Cody. </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.14\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;How in Khiras&apos; name did you let this happen? </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.15\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;But he looks confused.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.16\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;She opened the damn door, he seems to imply.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.17\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;My eyes gesture to the door as we watch oil mix with water: putting out one fire at a time. My mind screams in false telepathy, hoping his science brain can logically piece it together. You&apos;re lucky Kei came over here. It would be too much for Jullian to see your side!</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.18\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;His eyes parse between Jullian and I. Let&apos;s keep him away, he hopefully implies, just as Jullian turns to me. &quot;You never told me that . . . guy . . . lived next door to you,&quot; he says. &quot;And through a connecting door? Not even my house has that.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.19\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m surprised you guys live so close,&quot; Kei says. &quot;Never seen a builder&apos;s package with a door between townhomes.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.20\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;The gears turn in Cody&apos;s mind. &quot;Must have been for multi-family situations or something,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.21\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Kei steps a little further in, and the three of us approach her like pawns on a chessboard, afraid she might castle us. &quot;Speaking of builders&apos; packages, isn&apos;t this place new? And how did you get it to look like this?&quot; She says, now noticing the strangeness of their attire.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.22\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;And what are you two wearing?&quot; Jullian asks. &quot;Are you Royals? Living in this district? I know Master Cody is a scientist.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.23\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Scientist,&quot; Kei repeats, chuckling without recognizing the danger she incites. &quot;I guess an engineer is a scientist. We&apos;re both engineers at Navidson-Monroe.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.24\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not familiar with that family,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;Hyphenated must mean some drama&apos;s in there. Anyways &mdash; so you&apos;re a couple in the science guild. Katiya is my paramour, and we&apos;re together in the Royal Knights.&quot; It looks like some kind of relief comes to him when he sees Cody as even less of a threat.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.25\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Kei uses everything she has to not double over laughing. Probably seeing us as some of those cause-players Cody talked about. She hides it with a cough. &quot;Well, wow,&quot; she says. &quot;Interesting . . . neat design: it&apos;s very imaginative.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.26\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;Designed by the Guard: we had no say in it,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;And I live just down the way.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.27\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s great,&quot; Kei says. And then a long pause overstays its welcome, still shorter than Kei and Cody&apos;s presence in my world.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.28\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Cody pats his pants. &quot;Well. We&apos;ll leave you to it,&quot; he says, chuckling awkwardly as he shepherds Kei from the room.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.29\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;To that,&quot; I say. &quot;Left to it, we are.&quot; </p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.30\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;Cody shuts the door behind him, and I take my first deep breath since I&apos;ve entered my home.</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.31\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;&quot;What a bunch of deviants,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;That Cody guy is nice &mdash; was kind to my friend and all, but he and his lady dress so strangely.&quot;</p>",
        "<p id=\"2.24.6.32\" class=\"Katiya\">&emsp;His lady, I think. And for some reason, it bothers me.</p>"
