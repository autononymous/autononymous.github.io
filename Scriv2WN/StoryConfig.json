Over the course of the last few months, I've decided to restructure the story's order to make it more compelling out of the gate: with an 'in medias res' opening. <br> I've also made loads of progress on the story: already halfway into the third act of four, with everything planned out. <br> Can't tell you how excited I am to share this story with you. And if you're reading this, and I actually have readers out there, reach out to me on <a href='https://bsky.app/profile/savant-guarde.bsky.social'> BlueSky <a>, or send me a message on Discord @SavantGuarde#8032 :)<br>Thanks again for your support!<br><br>With love,<br>&emsp;<span style='font-family:Brush Script MT, cursive;font-size:1.5em;'>Savant-Guarde :)</span>"

But either way, I want to thank you for being here and supporting my work. <br><br>&emsp;FIREBRAND is the first novel I&apos;ve ever written. I wrote the bulk of this during a rough time of my life, when I was going to college in a different state: starting entirely from zero and not knowing anyone; allowing loneliness and unmedicated depression to lead me into a long spiral. <br><br>&emsp;But I came out the other side and I survived, making it through the long quarters of my engineering program. The concept of a continuous fight without an end in sight provided the fuel for the thesis of this story: <em>&apos;If you had an unlimited number of attempts to rewrite the past, would it break you, or would you find peace&apos;?</em> It also inspired the main character <strong>Titus</strong>: a suffer-it-alone kind of guy that was a lot like me before I learned my lesson, figuring out how to sincerely open up to people. <br><br>&emsp;This is an early release of the story, but the full story is entirely written: just being progressively edited. But, rest assured, if it&apos;s posted here, it&apos;s in polished enough a form that I&apos;m confident to post it.<br><br>&emsp;If you enjoy this work, please let me know on social media and feel free to share it with others.
