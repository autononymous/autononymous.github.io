    CHAPTER ONE
==============================================


In the long, dragging years after college, all I could ever ask is to waste my life as efficiently as possible. 
The atrophy began long before I crossed the stage to grab my diploma. Like falling in love, I'm not even sure where it began or how it came to pass, only that I was in it. Maybe it was the twenty-sixth hour awake at two o'clock in the library, on that Sunday before finals, when a study partner scrolling Facebook reminded me that it was my birthday. Maybe it was turning down Kei when she asked me to go out to celebrate, preferring the cold basement of the fraternity house when I knew everybody else would be away. Maybe it was that I felt more satisfied shelving the senior project I named after my late brother than all the accolades that came after it.
But it's been two-and-a-half years since I returned to my hometown in Colorado with the promise of a dream job at a local aerospace company, and my father got my foot in the door. I reached the summit of my Bachelors' degree with too much exhaustion to take in the view, and in the two-year descent on expired passions that once got me to the top, I can't think of anything exceptional that's happened since.
The thought recurs any time I'm in a state like this. All I hear is the white noise of my best friend snoring in sudden stops and starts on my futon, using one of the broken cardboard moving boxes as a bedsheet, rattling the mess of empty beer cans as he fights a losing battle for comfort.
It takes a moment to lift myself from the flimsy folding chair. I fight the spinning world, stumbling towards the kitchen counter to grab the remote. Freaky Friday autoplays on some free streaming service since I was too lazy to enter the family account. I reach to turn off the floor-bound wall TV, but I hesitate -- finding that I enjoy the faint sound of it over the silence.
It feels nice to have my friend here, I think.
The tears still wet my face, more from the laughter of digging up past memories than the feeling that haunts me in the times I'm alone. I find myself disoriented when I try to walk, so I lift my old lacrosse stick from the ground to use it as a cane, digging my fingers into the mesh of the basket, deciding to fetch a glass of water for my future self. 
But then an odd chill convects the wetness of my skin, and I remember how my parents ranted hours earlier on the importance of keeping heating bills down.
I hobble towards the wall, nearly in-step with Miguel's loud snore, trying to dodge the crumpled cans. The window is open, but the breeze funnels out instead of in. And when I close the window, I feel my ears pop from the rising pressure. I remember my first thermo class: isn't hot supposed to run to cold?
The air is dry, and when I stumble towards the source of the gusting winds -- the small closet beneath the stairs -- a faint, flickering light glows in the space beneath the door.
An empty can crunches when I step on it, and I realize I'm still wearing my steel-toed shoes, along with the rest of my casual work clothes. The lacrosse stick braces me as I stumble forwards--feeling like my uncle does on Ambien when he doesn't fall asleep in time--until my hand touches the freezing handle.
Tumultuous winds scream beneath the door and through the cracks, bashing the fitting against the lock. My mind doesn't work well when it's crossed, but I find myself fixated on how strange the closet door looks. I never noticed the handle, etched with an intricacy so far outside the palate of the builders' package. Surely Mom or Dad would have noticed it on any one of the tours, right?
I turn the knob far enough that the bolt no longer withholds the gale. The wooden door buffets me in the face. Stars flash in my vision, and if it weren't for the lacrosse stick, I would have slammed my head on the granite counter. Instead, I find myself slumped beneath the bartop, barricaded by two metal stools.
I'm speechless until the rooms equalize in pressure, rubbing out the ache in my forehead. I lift my eyes. No longer does the closet greet me, but the light of a whole other townhouse on the opposing side.
Unable to fathom whether this dream is just the imaginings of an inebriated mind, I lift myself from the floor and stumble through the threshold of the archway. The contours of the floor change from that of smooth, buffered wood to sanded planks and stone. On the other side is another thick wooden door with the same handle, thrown all the way open. I wonder if my neighbors are so old that they insist on the technology of the last century. Who would spend the money to furnish their townhome this way, with walls and decor so aged my great-grandmother would feel at home?
It feels so wrong to be here, but I'm a social drunk, and this is a chance to make friends.
"Hello? You forgot to lock your door. Sorry to intrude -- I'm the neighbor from the unit on the other side. My name is Cody, Cody Dunsmore," I say, and so I continue, stammering my words to ensure my presence isn't a surprise, though with cast iron kettles and candles, I doubt these fogies would be agile enough to swing anything at their friendly intruder.
I find a knight's uniform on the table, tailored to a woman's measurements, along with realistic metal boots.
"The old bat must be into costume play. Whatever gets you off," I mutter, but then I see the biggest surprise leaning against the wall. I try to take it in my hands, but it's so damn heavy: nothing like the weapons those mall ninjas buy at conventions.
I drop the lacrosse stick to try to lift it. Surely it's one of those real-looking swords the neckbeards buy, right?
Nope.
"Christ almighty!" I exclaim.
I try to steady it the same way I saw in the movies, but it kills my wrists. I wonder how many exercises these geriatric fantasy fetishists have to do to hold a sword like this, like holding a barbell by its end.
I put it back against the wall, and I decide to try speaking again. 
"Hello? You left your door open." 
The house smells too musty to be a new build, like it's seen generations of families through its halls. Spiderwebs collect in the corners of the cabinets. The crimson curtains are bleached from decades of continuous sunlight. And when I fumble for a light switch on the walls, I find nothing: nor a single cord in this simple home snaked across the surface.
The space is dead silent in the absence of appliances: so silent that I can hear the heartbeat in my ears. Maybe I should return home to try again tomorrow. 
But my plan is cut short when a shadow slides behind the marbled glass. I haven't the time to react when the door blasts open, screeching on rusted hinges. The intruder closes the distance before I even have a chance to react, blasting their glowing palm against my shoulder, casting me over their dining table with a whole handprint burned into my beer-stained work shirt.
The female knight is quick to pin me against the floor, straddling me with her bare thighs. My mind races to explain. I can only consider she's an influencer, or one of those intensely dedicated cosplayers I found LARPing on campus. Her speech is incoherent, but the longer she berates me in her mother language, drawing the prop knife against my neck as I struggle under her inhuman strength, a strange comprehension of her odd words slowly overtakes me.
I feel the sentiment behind her panic. I thought she was just speaking in tongues, but I can feel my mind strain as it arranges itself to piece together the meaning of the words. And when the headache passes, I realize that I can understand her fully.
Her eyes are a golden hazel from colored contacts, and I see both of them when she looks down at me, though she covers the one with scarred makeup with her bangs. She's dressed like one of those hobbyists at the Shaleborough Renaissance Faire. Her blond, silken braid hangs from her head as she leans over me, making her look more like an angry princess than a defensive knight.
"Please, please," I beg, slurring my words. "I'm your neighbor!"
But I find the panic in her face to be even greater than mine. She rocks on my torso with every shallow breath, and I feel the coolness of her cosplay armor chill the heat of my flesh as she pins my arms with her gauntlets. 
Her warm breath is on my neck as she tries to steady the prop knife, and she almost seems intimidated by my drunken composure. But it's the sudden rise in emotion that ignites something I'm even more afraid of -- and I try to make it known to her. 
"I think you should get off me, I - I can't control it," I say, but she's clueless about what she does to me, straddling my waist with her strong, bare thighs, the pulse of my heart quickly transitioning to my waist.
"What do you mean?" she asks.
My arms are pinned beneath her legs. The pressure pounds in my skull. There's no chance to try the waistband trick, and there's only one place that all the blood can go.
"You're a fool to break into the military district. I'm a knight of the Royal Guard," she declares, as the sharp edge of the very real knife digs into my neck. 
"I don't think you understand. I can't control what's going to happen," I say.
"You pathetic weakling, what could you possibly do now?" 
She has the upper hand. And all I have is a single word I learned on the Internet.
"S-S-Scaroused."
"Scaroused?" The words might be lost, but she definitely notices the new sapling in her living room. 

Her face flushes in mere seconds. While I'm scanning the room to see if I'm on one of those prank shows I watch to pass time at work, I struggle beneath her as she tensions the knife against my neck. And when I feel the cold steel scratch the stubble beneath my chin, drawing the heat from my neck, I realize it's real enough to draw something else from me.
"You degenerate! You lecherous, filthy animal, breaking in my house to . . . to--"
She quickly retreats, her piercing, yellow eyes assessing me with stronger eye contact than I had at my first job interview.
I lack the mental capacity to decide whether to laugh or scream. "I swear, I didn't break in here," I say, still embarassed as I cover my erection with my hands, hoping her e-girl stardom has dumbed her down enough to lack object permanence. I gesture to the closet. "The door was open. I just walked in."
She points the knife at me, then gestures to the closet. "The door was locked, you fool. And the closet? How would you break through a damn closet? There's no windows in there."
"I know, but please. I'm as confused as you are," I say, taking a breath as I try to abate the dizziness I feel from changing positions so fast. "Give me a chance to explain."
"You're excited, not confused!" She points the dagger between my legs. "You don't have the right to be confused right now."
She rambles on like I actually came in to assault her. With the capacity for only one emotion, I settle for anger, pissed about the shit hand I've been dealt in moving next to this crazy bitch.
She says, "I'm the one that's confused at how--"
"--Would you let me explain? Dear God!" I say.
"It's Gods, you heretic," she says. And she looks so legitimately angry that I'm unsure whether she's spent too much time online to live in the real world. "Respect the other races. We're not the only one that shares Fosroth, and all our Gods have proven their presence."
"God, I said," I say. "A real god. Not the ones you cosplay freaks pretend to worship.
"Do you want to be executed for apostasy? Because I can do that for you, right now." Her hollow words mean little when I'm more focused on the closet. Maybe one of my eyes still wanders over her toned body, and the powerful thighs that once straddled me, and the musculature of her core -- or maybe it's just because I'm so crossed on Miguel's mini-Mason-Jar-stash that my eyes are still crossing, too.
But she notices where I'm retreating, and in an instant, she sidesteps towards the door, using the knife to goad me away from my new home.
I make myself clear. "Listen. What I want is to go home: not to get stabbed by a letter opener. I'm your neighbor, and the door between our units was open. I was simply trying to tell you. But really -- did you have to tackle me to get your point across?"
"You do not live here. This is the Military District. Besides -- you've proved that you are far too weak to live here," she says, and whether she's sold on her delsuions or not, I've still settled on an ger.
"You bitch! I can bench a plate at least."
"Putting plates on benches? What, are you a fat oaf that eats outside all day?" She looks for evidence beneath the tattered fabric of my work shirt, and I know I train arms every damn time I go to the gym.
I try to stand, but still don't have the balance to pull it off. So I try diplomacy, to seek a common ground with this psycho cosplay chick. "I'm sorry to intrude. Look. I know you might be into cosplay or whatever, but this is taking things too far." I rack my mind on all the anime and movies I've seen with characters like her.
"Cosplay?" She asks, as if she doesn't know the word.
"Costume play," I say, glaring with as much disbelief as I can manage: this bitch acts like an eskimo that's never seen snow before. "At first I thought it was old people living here: the kettle, the candles . . . I mean, the whole damn house is set up like Skyrim."
I try to find a single outlet, wondering if she footed the bill with her e-girl dollars to strip them all out of a new unit. And as I wonder how she streams on the computer, a new anger sets her over the edge.
"This is not a COSTUME!" She exclaims, and it makes me flinch. I feel my body retreat backwards, away from home and towards her front door, trying to remember the door code I just set so Miguel doesn't have to wake up and let me in.
She matches me step-for-step as I crab walk towards the strange entry door, thinking of all the violations I'll be reporting to the HOA to get her ass thrown out. "Do you know how hard I worked for this?"
"Yeah . . . lots of trips to the craft store," I say. I stare at the contours of her chest armor, crushed in a space that was obviously designed for male cosplayers.
"How hard I worked to wear this proudly as a guardian?"
I remember what took me to the art store a week ago. "Yeah. Did you make it during the craft foam sale? I go there for the graphing pencils."
"What the Res are you on about?"
"Mechanical pencils," I say. "Point-five lead is like a toothpick, breaks every damn time. And yet point-nine is like writing with a fucking crayon--"
"You dare to insult me like this?" She asks. "For what, because I'm a female guard?"
"No, of course not," I say. "You're very convincing. It's amazing. Steel letter opener? Form-fit foam from the craft store for the interlays, along with actual metal for some of your armor?" I ramble further on details, trying to buy myself time, but she's still hung on something I said. "I'm sure you have loads of followers like my cousin does. I know I'd follow you."
"You're too yellow to follow me anywhere," she says.
"Online, I mean."
"On what line?" And we're back in fantasyland again. "The front? You would never get close. They'd keep you busy peeling potatoes with such soft hands," she says.
"Soft hands? Please," I say. "You're the job that banks on soft hands. While you're busy pleasuring perverts over your webcam, I work in an office. Designing the damn future. Because the rest of us have to work real jobs, not getting paid by thirsty horndogs that jerk off to Shakespeare!"
"The real work is defending the ungrateful, undeserving gentry like you," she says. "Why don't you crawl back to mummy and daddy dearest for another bump to your filthy allowance?"
She seems satisfied with her verbal assault, but I'm over it.
"Enough pretend. Your knife isn't even real," I say.
"Pray tell, does this feel real?"
She takes a slash at my arm with the letter opener. It looked so dull it could only carve butter. I wagered that her fantasies would end at actual assault, but I was so incredibly wrong. It was after I felt a burning sensation slide across the palm of my hand that the blood fountained down my arm, quickly coating the tattered edges of my favorite dress shirt with bright crimson.
The panic seizes my throat, and I'm barely able to let the words escape. The panic precipitates the pain. "You . . you actually . . ." I manage, expecting surprise to flush her face when she realizes the lawsuit that awaits her. But She remains perfectly resolute, shaking my blood off the slender blade with an illegal amount of edge.
"It's time for you to leave," she says. "It's getting late, and by the Gods, I'd rather abstain from filing a casualty report tonight."
"Jesus Christ! Are you insane? Do you have no boundary with your stupid fantasy? Castle Law or not, I'm calling the police." I fumble for the door. I decide to regroup when I have the resources to fight her where it hurts. I'll report her to the IRS: no way she's paying taxes on all that streamer money, playing Poppy Playtime for a gooner audience that give her enough cuckhold dollars to afford a townhome.
"Get out," she demands.
"This was my favorite shirt!" I add.
"I said, GET OUT!"
As soon as the door cracks open, I feel the cold steel of her boot bludgeon me straight in the chest, graphing a brown-and-bloody outline on the patterned print.  I roll down the stairs, settling on the stoop as my hand throbs and oozes at the rhythm of my pulsing heart: wrapping it tightly with the tattered remains of my cherished shirt.

I wince at the pins and needles throbbing in my hand, thinking about how I'm gonna borrow my cousin and her law degree and sue that damn bitch. Engineering might make me just enough to get by beyond the mortgage, but there's no way in hell I'm paying for medical care. I'll take an Uber to the hospital before I call an ambulance.
Cursing under my breath makes it easier to bear. I tear the sleeve off my muddy, bloodstained shirt so I can try to wrap it up, all while I try to remember the content of my middle school health class.
It's the first time I'm able to look around and take in my surroundings. The sky is overcast and pitch-dark, with none of Denver's light pollution obscuring the stars. A great body of water spans before me, which is puzzling: if I left the adjoining unit from the front, shouldn't Emerald Lake be a couple blocks away?
My housing development is devoid of streetlights by design, but when I squint to see the lights that illuminate the road, they flicker. The roads are dirty. And as I grasp the fabric of my tattered shirt as tightly as I can, plotting a large, crimson cardioid, I wonder how the HOA could ever let things get this bad with how much they say they're going to scalp me every month.
A group of five strangers approach. They hasten their walk when they find I'm on my knees: two of them far larger than I am, but all four of them far more built. They're carrying swords and wearing armor.
I don't know whether to laugh or to cry.
Hiding behind them is a furry, watching nervously. I'm distracted by how perfect their fursuit is: her eyes move away when I try to meet them, flicking the tail with some kind of servo or something.
"What is going on in this suburb? Early Halloween? Did y'all leave a D&D session? I thought it was all old people here," I say.
"Old people? This is the Military District," one of them says: it's a half catgirl, half more than the full catgirl behind her, 'casting fire' in their palm to give us some light. I'm impressed at how well they sell it.
The darker-skinned bald one bends down to look at my palm, still taller than my crouch at half his height. "You have got a good slice there. What happened?"
"Was it Chymaerans?" The other lunk says.
The others look at him disapprovingly.
"Enough of the Chymaeran talk," says the half-catgirl with dark hair and furry ears. "I've got the training. I can heal him."
"As in a med-kit?" I ask. "Some peroxide and a bandage?"
"No," She says. "Essence."
"What is that?" I expect it's an off-brand painkiller or holistic herbs: nothing better than a Band-Aid.
"Look -- do you want my help or not?" She asks, staring me down with her cold, azure eyes.
"Sure," I say. She groans in annoyance before taking my palm between her hands. "Where's the Neighborhood Patrol? I thought the cops were supposed to be out since those kids went tagging at the pool," I say.
"What in Khiras' name are you on about?" The dark-skinned one asks. He looks me up and down. "You're rather odd. Are you sure you're from here? What's your name, anyway?"
"Name? He who asks should give their name first," I say. These weeaboos might get a kick from an anime reference if they're gonna pretend-heal me with their Etsy light gloves.
"My name is Ryder Zebal. This is Jullian, Aryn, Pax, and Naya," he says.
Might as well befriend the neighbors. 
"I'm Cody. Cody Dunsmore, and I just moved here." I realize I don't have a hand to shake: my left one is being healed with what feels like glove-warmers and LEDs.
"Too strange for a Chymaeran," the lunk called Pax says. 
But Jullian's eyes nervously cycle between the direction of my body and the window of the violent girl's house, watching the window for a silhouette to stand between the curtains. "What are you doing outside Katiya's house?"
"Oh, so you know her?" I ask. Maybe they're all friends, feeding off each other's delusions. And if I tell too much, they might testify against me.
"Yeah," Jullian says. "We're . . . friends."
"So she really lives there," Aryn says -- a grown adult wearing cat ears that's pretending to heal my wound with hand warmers. I'm unsure whether the secondhand shame hurts more than the blood loss.
"Why does that intrigue you?" Jullian asks.
"Just a funny coincidence," Aryn says.
Ryder seems to play a leadership role. As they wait for Aryn to work her dollar-store magic, he asks, "how about your papers?"
The word 'papers' is kinda weird, but I play along with their improv, in case they live close and I'll have to see them again. 
I reach into my back pocket with my free hand, but my wallet isn't there. I must have left it on the counter after I tipped the delivery guy.
"Hold on a sec," I say.
They reach for their swords though I can only reach one hand myself, all while Aryn is still 'working her magic.'
I retrieve my phone from my pocket. They stare as if it were some kind of monolith. I light the screen with a tap then swipe up to turn on the flashlight.
Click.
They instantly dive backwards, frightened when the blinding flash illuminates the streets brighter than the flickering lamps. Aryn is the only one that doesn't hesitate.
"Good thing I downloaded the MyColorado App recently. Let's see here . . ." I swipe down to type M-Y-C in the search bar, and then tap the first result.
They're still petrified, standing there with their swords drawn.
"Very funny. You guys are great at improv," I say. "See? Right here. Class C. I can drive, officer." I hold the bright screen towards Ryder. He draws closer, entranced by the display.
"What kind of magic is this? Are you some kind of mage? An inventor in the Royal Court of Science? Or are you a Mask? Of the Gods?"
"I'm just an engineer," I tell them. "Hardly one at that."
"An inventor, then," Jullian says.
I look to the full-on furry catgirl called Naya. She's hypnotized as if I shined a laser in front of her.
"Well, I should get going," I tell them, feeling light-headed. "I've got to get home and bandage this for real. It's going to--" 
I flex my hand. 
It feels like nothing. 
"I have to . . ."
I turn the flashlight from the roadway, looking down at my palm, then turn to Aryn. "How in God's name did you do that? Did you glue it?"
"No, idiot. You're Human, aren't you? Don't you have the powers of fire and life?"
"No?" I say.
"Well, get on home then, civilian. It's past curfew. And we can't be responsible for you if you wander off," Aryn says. She playfully extends her arm around Jullian, leading the group off into the darkness. 
I wait until the four of them disappear into the shadows, then I try the handle of Katiya's door.
It's locked.
I run around the back, onto an unfamiliar cobblestone street, and counting as many houses over as it took to turn the corner, I try the window.
It's open.
I flex my left hand, still not feeling any anguish, pressing my ear to the window to try and discern where the girl is. I spend minutes listening to silence, until I hear my best friend's scream on the other side.
I throw open the window, dragging myself over the sill and depositing myself on the floor. My shoulder aches where her scalding hands burned me. I twist my body to get my feet beneath me, and manage to stand in front of the door.
And I feel the presence of the girl called Katiya.
I level the lacrosse stick I used as a crutch after I lift it off the floor, tearing off the rubber end cap, flipping it around so the basket faces me. And surely enough, like a reflection in the mirror, I see the female knight standing there on the other side.
We pause there for a couple seconds. There's a panic still deep inside her eyes. I stagger my footing with my hands together on the stick, ready to body her with a cross-check, waiting for her to make the first move since I'm on the defensive.
And, surely enough, the girl rushes me, but not for play. She gathers incredible speed as she dips her shoulder like a lineman coming in for another tackle, and the sober part of my mind begins to wonder if her background is actually in extorting men for cash.
Her bloodthirsty lack of hesitation to dice my palm? She has to be ex-military, but looks as if she's the same age as I am. Her outfit looks too perfect to be fake, unless she's financed it with thousands of dollars. And all the intricacies of her scars and strong, slender body look like too much of an effort to maintain unless fighting was her only job.
The only thought on my sobering mind is the mystery of her. And as she swiftly closes the space between us, I let the anger and hate flood my muscles with every intention to destroy her.

    Act One: Spring
----------------------------------------------


==============================================
    CHAPTER TWO
==============================================


I try to let the peace and joy flood my muscles, with every intention to relax. But I wasn't made for this. I hate drinking. The only thought on my inebriated mind are the words of my late father, and even if they were delivered as a whisper, they're far louder than the raucous trainees crowding Gaffe's End Tavern.
He said that I would never find peace in shouldering the weight of all the world. He said it wasn't because I was weak, or that I was naive -- or that I wasn't aware of all the reasons we had to be afraid. He said it was because those feelings were wasting my life. 
And then he died the next day in his sleep: burned alive with his youngest progeny that lacked the strength to fight back.
My father made the same mistake that all the other villagers make, thinking that suffering is only caused by change. They think the discomfort in their everyday lives is just an affect of higher forces -- whether by the whims of the Gods or the everlasting hunger of our war. They assume the rare breadths of stillness are caused by a break in the action: that war and its wreckage are just the affects of an empire's ambition; that all the fighting is only driven by greed.
That if we stopped fighting, no one would have to die.
They fall to that temptation to live the lie, to say it so long and loud that they think their words can incarnate it. Gods know it's as effective as sleeping beneath barricades of bedsheets to ward off the Chymaera, hiding as the East shakes the ground with its ravenous hunger.
But they're wrong. They have no idea of how much violence has to happen just to keep things exactly the way they are.
Six months have passed since we arrived here. We were taken straight from graduation, the first time they hitched wagons to motorcars instead of horses. It was as soon as we dropped our bags in the barracks that the Royal Guardsmen kept us busy in every waking moment, spending every second of daylight training in the militarized city of Gaffesend. 
Yet that freedom ends today. 
I find myself here in Gaffesend Tavern, sitting at a bartop, watching the bustling narrow street in front of the grand lake, wondering why my boyfriend Jullian hasn't bothered to approach me. 
I hate drinking because it always makes me feel like I'm too weak to face reality. Before long, I realize I'm not watching the exits -- and the more I keep pace with my male comrades, the more I find some stupid hope that this dizziness might shake my own feelings loose. I swirl the crimson ale around in the wooden mug to free the bubbles, envying how easily they float to the surface. 
An hour passes since the close of labour. The cobblestone streets bustle with villagers returning home from a long day's work. There are four of us that watch from the window, entranced by the balance of energy between two worlds. Now is that rare hour when the drunken stupor of the pub's regulars matches the stumble of the tiresome commoners. The sun has already vanished below the mountains, but its colorful influence reflects across the lake.
I get the spins as my childhood friend Bertram talks to Ryder and Naya, two shy recruits that would sit alone if we weren't all friends. None of us would be here if they weren't dangling the keys to our new homes at the end of it, forcing us all to weather the best and worst of our graduating class. Somewhere behind us, the others laugh and cheer. They've convinced themselves that this transition is a triumphant victory, too shortsighted to see that life in Gaffesend rides on the results of an enervating final test. 
There's no more simulations, practice runs, or drills. Failure is a one-way ticket to the front lines, and I will never get another chance.
I take another sip, coaxing that feeling of joy to wash over me. I can tell that Bertram thinks the same thoughts when his eyes rest on the village on the other side of the lake. He nudges my right arm before opening his mouth to speak, gesturing to the twelve other trainees behind him.
"To them it's just a random assignment, no more than the toss of a coin. But to you and I, and maybe Ryder, this is divine. This is the will of the Gods, Katiya. This is the first sentence in our declaration of war."
I tell him it is, and with my next swallow of ale, I prove it.
The details are hazy. My mind protects me by forgetting everything I witnessed as a young child, and the harder I push to excise them, the deeper they dig. All I have left is the memory of Bertram pulling me from the smoldering cabin, dragging me to my mother Stella so that our fractured families could escape to the south.
"For years I was so angry," I tell him. "If I could have joined the forces then, I would have put off all the schooling. I would have gone straight to the front lines to find justice for what they did to us."
"So why didn't you?" He asks with a smirk.
I shrug. "How could all Chymaerans be evil if there are people like Pax that have their blood?"
I gesture to the half-blooded halfwit behind us. Paxton uses his Chymaeran Essence to try to freeze the watered-down liquor, enough to stack a seventh shot glass as the others cheer him on, drawing the attention of all the other patrons. Even Ryder puts his book down for a second to watch, letting out a small chuckle as it wavers.
"You have honor and a kind heart, and it's what I like about you. What I always have," Bertram says. He leans close enough that I can feel his firm shoulder press against mine. "But keep enough of that anger. If we don't make the program -- or if the enemy breaks the lines and crosses the lake in the winter -- that fury is the only thing that's going to keep us alive."
"Rest assured it runs in my circuits with the Essence," I tell him. "The long winter ends with our probation. It's spring now, and we have a--"
My words cut short when the tower crashes on the eighth glass. Pax presses his face to the table's surface, sucking up whatever he can of the liquor and the attention. 
But I still find that I'm unable to escape the gravity of that feeling -- that dragging desire that's followed me since the beginning. The desire to have that one moment that validates all of it, that makes it all worth something. And I pray to the Gods that longing is stronger than the fear of what lies ahead. 

It all starts when Chief Aldrin climbs the small stage. Tonight it's edicts instead of music, and he takes a swig from his mug to make sure the words sound like a toast instead of orders.
"It was three months ago that you all graduated in the top of your class. Instead of heading straight to the front lines, you were chosen to challenge yourself with a higher purpose. You demonstrated that you might have what it takes to join our ranks full-time. And starting tomorrow, you'll get your chance to prove yourself as something special."
Aldrin Valensend pauses expecting cheers, but he's met with silence. The cadets' faces fall when reality crashes their party.
"Or else it's off to the meat grinder," Ryder mutters, closing his book on an earmarked page. "The machine is hungry again."
So hungry they'd let in women like me, I think. To wear the men's leftovers.
"S-so hungry they'd let in outsiders like me, I guess." Naya's ears twitch as she mutters into her cup. The Ahkvan swishes her tail with apprehension, and when Aldrin opens his mouth to try to rally us again, she withdraws her face from the mug, saturating the bronze fur on her face with a fine mustache of suds.
"Look. I can tell you're all nervous," he says. "It's why I have the kegs here, to try to loosen you up a little," he says, taking another swig as if it will get him one sip closer to connecting with us. "Trust me, lads. There's fear in every class -- I've seen fifteen in my time, and the reaction is the same every night before. But I want you to understand that you are not fighting for a limited number of slots. There is not a set number: you have already proved your excellence in the Capital. And if you keep that excellence, you will join us. I mean, Katiya's brother Erik joined us last year." He turns to me for validation. "Didn't Erik say it wasn't that bad?"
I say, "It wasn't bad for his health, at least. Without all the drinking, he dropped a near twenty pounds."
The cadets chuckle, and Aldrin looks a little more self-assured.
"Well, I can assure you that the last three months is a hard as this probation gets." He holds up a stamped sheet of vellum scrawled with ink. "You see this page?"
We all recongize it immmediately. It was taken straight from the posting board outside the field office.
"This system hearkens back to the old days. Back to those centuries ago when the world was vastly unexplored: those centuries when bands of brave adventurers took tasks to be paid in Kine, back when the empire's reach was shorter. When ruins and old dungeons were unexplored, before we could raise whole armies with the singnal single --" he stutters, wetting his tongue with another sip-- "erm, single signal, of a wire." He waves the document in his hand, and the air is quiet enough to hear the heavy wax seal shake the paper. "This is the lifeblood of our operation. We call them quests."
The cadets cringe. As if any of these tasks could be considered heroic, I think.
Bertram nudges me. "Did this process come out of a fable?"
"But it's not slaying monsters. Or, at least, not most of them. Maybe one of our elders has a problem with rats that savaged her Essenced crops, and they might start a fire if they gnaw the wires. Maybe it's a domestic dispute that needs authority. Or maybe it's a family near the eastern border that wants to feel safe.
Those are the ones I'll take, I think.
"And then there's the ones that take a little more courage. Scouting positions. Thrusting yourself just a small distance beyond the lines to make sure there's nothing there, prodding at the Purgatory Mountains with one of our mentors."
My stomach drops at the thought, but I hate that feeling.
He concludes, "These are the quests you will be completing. And there is always an overwhelming number of them, so you will never have a dull moment. Beyond quests, there are just a few standard competencies that all our guards take to test physical standards: no harder than what you've already--"
A cadet cuts him off without raising his hand.
"So what, then, we just do them?"
"You want to wait for me to finish, Pax? Gods above," Aldrin says. "Yes. You take them. You finish them. And you get them signed off and stamped by the ones that wrote them, whether they're townsfolk or the Knights of the Royal Guard. You hold on to them, and every month you submit them. Along with the results of your competencies."
I can predict the next question before he asks it. All I wonder is if he'll raise his hand this time, and surely enough:
"Well, do we have to do some of the hard ones, or else we'll be sent to the war?" 
The nervous air breaks with laughter. Pax's hand is raised this time, and it stays there.
"No, of course not. Remember when I said you already proved yourselves? This is only about reaching a minimum."
"Of how many?"
"Shut your mouth, Pax," Ryder says, but he cracks a smile. The room's laughter grows.
"Of . . . no number, Gods damn it!" Aldrin balls his fists, but finds relief at how the joyful spirit returns to his young cadets. "You'll do as many as you think is right. And we'll see how many you do."
We all seem to feel a little better. The Ahkvas telegraph their feelings the easiest: I can see Naya's frayed tail loosen as she relaxes.
"So." Aldrin clears his throat. "I know that small chance scares you, but I want you to forget it. You've worked for years and years to get out into the world beyond the capital, and here you are! You better be damn sure that you live up to that. Get closer with the people of our town. Assimilate yourself into our community. Spend time with your comrades between quests: go hike a trail, head to the hot spring on a day off, and listen well to the senior guardsmen, all right?"
"Sir, yes sir!" we shout from habit.
"No, no! This isn't training anymore. Stop that," he barks. "Work hard and live well. Make this time feel like you're the adventurers of the old days. And, please -- do something other than drink here every night, understood?"
"Sir-" We hesitate, raising our mugs instead.
"Fill up, lads," he says. "A toast to your future!"

The fledgling Royal Knights form a line at the kegs, their mugs wavering as suds spill across the warped wooden floorboards. We raise our full cups as color drains from the sky, and somewhere across Lake Garrison, the faint amethyst glow of Chymaeran Essence emanates from the silhouetting pines.
I throw back another two fills on a challenge, and not long after, I find myself among the last of our group. Most of the others left to explore their new townhomes as official trainees of the Royal Guard. Naya and Ryder vanished as soon as possible. Some of the others dragged Pax outside so he wouldn't vomit on the floor, and I haven't seen him since.
Jullian is still distant, chatting in the corner with his group of friends. Bertrand sits next to me on the long wooden bench in the corner, careful to keep us from touching though he sits rather close, enough for me to smell the booze on his breath.
"You know," he stammers, "I haven't said something for a while."
"What something?" I ask, afraid to risk standing or else I'll crash through the coffee table. I twirl the key around my finger in the opposite direction of the twisting world.
"Something ever," he says, then clarifies, "Ever said, yeah."
"Ever? Like, ever ever?"
"Ever," he says. "Never, I mean. And I don't know if now is the right time." Bertrand looks almost uncomfotable. His blue eyes rattle in his skull when he tries to look at me, brushing his dark hair to the side. "I--"
A hand grabs my arm. It's Jullian.
"It's time to go home, Katiya," he says.
"But why?" I ask.
"Because we have to get up early tomorrow."
"For what?" I ask.
"For the first day of work, remember?" He says.
I struggle to focus my mind, but I manage to ask the question. "Then why in Khiras' name did the Commander plan a party the night before?"
Jullian pauses for a second, while Bertram nods in agreement. "That's actually a really good question," Jullian says. "Maybe as a test? Or just so he can scold the ones that don't show up tomorrow?"
I mutter something even I don't understand when my stomach tries to transition from sitting to standing. My body goes limp when he escorts me from the couch.
Jullian turns to Bertram. "You should leave, too." He returns an uncomfortable glare when Jullian stabilizes me in an embrace, muttering something about him being mad because his parents gave his name too many L's.
"I guess we're going," I tell Bertram.
"Well, get home safe," he mutters, losing his campaign against gravity as his body crashes against the vacant bench.
Jullian's thin as a reed, but he's strong enough to escort me from the pub. The air is crisp and cold when we step outside. Our boots crunch in the melting frost from winter's last snowstorm, and we find a relief from the humidity of twenty-some cadets. Beneath his bangs of dirty blonde hair, he always seems to hold a permanent look of discontent, but I know it's not because he's angry.
"Why didn't you join me? Sitting with all the quiet ones," he says.
"They're my friends," I tell him. "And they could be yours if you spent more time with all of them."
He tensions his fingers in mine. "You still could have come by, though."
And so could you, I think, but it's less effort to just apologize. "I'm sorry."
"I know you're satisfied with the friends you have, but I just want to meet new people. And, compared to the city, our assignment here feels like a second chance for someone like me."
I pause for a moment. "What do you mean, 'a second chance?'"
"No, no! I mean, I wasted so many years of my life afraid to make friends. It was so easy to tell myself that I shouldn't bother trying -- that I was too busy taking care of my brothers when my mother spent her days slaving away on the looms."
I nod, coaxing him to continue.
"So many of my younger years I wasted. That was until you came along and showed me that I was more than that, that I was worth it."
"Well, you are worth it," I say. "You should know that."
"But do you see what I mean? Most days it feels like I can't even speak right. You spend you days with one core group of friends because you've already figured it out, but every time I gather the courage to speak, it feels like a performance." He sniffles from the cold. "You're a bird that was pushed out of the nest at just the right time to learn to fly, but I never left the nest. And now my body is so much heavier, and my wings feel so uncomfortable."
"I've always said you can practice with me," I tell him.
"But it comes so naturally to you, though. You're so beautiful. The world begs for you to interact with it, but I'm just average-looking."
"So you're saying that all I have going for me is my looks?" I grab the collar of his shirt as I slur the words, but not hard enough to come off as real anger. "That's all you think of me, huh, that I'm just a dazzling piece of arm candy? I'm a Gods-damn warrior!"
He stutters over an apology. Maybe he still struggles to tell the difference between anger and sarcasm. My hands tension further around his shirt, and I derive an odd pleasure from seeing him squirm a little here and there.
I feel my fingers trace past his left ear, grazing the hairs of his neck before I draw him down to my height. "Then maybe you can show me with your actions, if the words aren't enough."
He hesitates for a moment, but the resonant pull of our bodies' Essence is too strong. I can feel his heartbeat hasten as the feeling goads him closer. I plant kisses on his neck, and for several minutes, we allow our anxieties to precipitate the act that absolves them.
The lamplighter walks around us, using his Essence to light the streetlamps, and I nearly lean the two of us into a bush. I can feel him surrender to his instincts when his arms embrace me, and below, I can feel evidence of his excitement.
"I think we should get home," he says. "To yours."

    CHAPTER THREE
==============================================


My mind loiters in the long lull between emails, dragging the 3D model on my computer in circles. The flat fluorescents take the office closer to a colorless center: what my colleague calls "suicide gray," showing no sign of winter's transition to spring. Somewhere beyond the window shades and bleached brick walls, life awakens from its slumber in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, trading the dormant golden brown for verdant green. And though the end of winter is supposed to bring that nostalgic chill, I'm kept lukewarm by the hum of an unbalanced, rusted fan that rattles over any sound of nature.
But I notice one thing, at least. I can smell the dry acreage of cereal grasses scattered across the Rocky Mountain foothills: a sense that only comes when it's late in the fall, or after the long winter when my nose is no longer running, when the world begins to open. It's when the late sun absorbs in the fronds of dormant fields once left to shadow -- that golden hour late in the workday -- when an arid essence gusts through the cracked corners of the crumbling ceiling.
Our department's office is tucked in the brow of several hills that block it from a captivating view. It was home to Navidson-Monroe's Aerospace division in the sixties, still sharing a wall with the warehouse where technicians toil over our drawings. But the Aerospace team and its bean counters made their great migration in the nineties, taking their perch a couple hundred feet higher atop the foothills: glancing down upon the city of Denver, convinced their fingers feel for the pulse of the throat of the world. 
So then the less-sexy divisions -- like us -- fell down into their musty wake, too far behind the "cutting edge" to earn a view beyond the cutting edge. 
Working in the battery division of an aerospace company is like eating ice cream every day, but it's got raisins in it. A fine treat for a new graduate, but I crave something that tastes more like space -- like Dippin' Dots, or maybe those freeze-dried ice creams they sell at the science museum. It's like ordering a salad at a pizza place, or ordering a cheeseburger at a Mexican restaurant. Or any other food-related simile: I'm just hungry and bored since it's so close to the end of the day, and I don't have any frozen meals left in the break room fridge.
But maybe every dream is a Pyrrhic compromise between that first, beatific vision and half of anything you ever bargained for. When I glance out the surly glass window, cocking my head at just the right angle, I can see the same shimmering solar reflectors and satellite dishes I saw from the window of my childhood bedroom. And although the Level 01 insignia on my nametag hasn't changed in two-and-a-half years, I guess I'm at least physically closer.
One day I'll design rockets, I promised myself.
My father said that's what it takes to chase a dream. I believe in that freedom because I don't have a choice. I'm the last chance my mother and father have to see their child make it, and when I look at the wallpaper of my brother and I on the vertical monitor, I remember I'm the only one who was blessed with time.

    CHAPTER TEN
==============================================


There's no early breaks in all the domestic quests. It only took a couple days before I realized that sitting on the job was a bad image, unless you have a lunch pail in your hands. Just like any routine -- whether it's a new cycle of combat training, classes, or a new job -- the first three days are memorable because it's all so fresh. I thought taking different quests would make each day distinct from the last, but from the fourth day onward, it all became a blur of motion, forgotten at the end of each day by an exaspirated body and a tired mind.
This is the first job on city watch that has me raking leaves on the side. Though the mountainside is still flushed with fading green, the eager leaves transform from yellow to red and deposit themselves early on the stone thoroughfares. From a raised vantage point at the southwestern hillside of Gaffesend, I abate the stress by drawing in the crisp mountain air, watching as the browning wild lashes of the southern grasslands are battered about by gale winds.
Long in the distance, the grand lake reflects the shadowed mountain view, too far to make the crests of little waves. I watch as junior guards paddle back from their postings on the outer rim, wondering which of my friends are among them. But it's nice to know that at least I'm not alone.I've gotten to know her a lot better: the shy pair well with the timid since they end up taking similar tasks. 
"When should we head down?" Naya asks.
"Well there's certainly no shortage of leaves, the Verdalan Gods make sure of it. Maybe now, I guess," I tell her. "This was all supposed to be done before the royals came to town, as if miles of road could be effectively polished by five junior guards."
"What does such a task even have to do with protecting?" Naya mutters.
"We're protecting . . . the . . . image, I guess, of the city. And next we'll be protecting the parade route."
"Sometimes it feels like they're just trying to keep us busy with silly tasks," she says.
"It's allowed me to get to know the locals really well, at least. They say they're glad we take the tasks that make a difference."
"That's because you fawn for social interaction, it's quite marvelous to me how you're so full of energy all the time. But that's coming from someone who doesn't make friends unless they see them every day for about a month."
"A month?" The math surprises me. But it sounds about right when I count all the days I've taken off. I walk with Oriya, Jullian, Berry, and Ryder every morning for five of them, to take new postings from the quest board and get to work. Every sixth or so, I persuade them to join me on a hike or go swimming in the hot springs. And every night is my chance to get out and socialize when I'm not taking night quests: having only scouted twice, I feel quite distant from the others.
The loneliness carries into other areas, too. I've only seen Jullian five times since the start of this transition. Besides walking to work hand-in-hand, we've gotten together almost every day off to blow off some steam. I've only been able to convince him once to go on a date with me to the hot springs, and it was on my earnings. The other times he says he's too busy -- though I always see him with his friends. It disappoints me when our acts of passion end as soon as he gets off: the only courtesy he seems to have is letting me get there first.
We descend the hill as the northern scouts congregate in Gaffesend Square. The bell tolls midday: normally that would mean a break for rations, but our service is expected to run later, and nobody minds when it makes this a "two-quest-day."
"I bet Bertram rues being sick when quest forms are this easy," I tell Naya. The slowness of this life almost makes me believe that Gaffe is as insular as the capital, capable of holding small events for royalty passing through the town. We're ordered to line up on the sides of the Main Street. It feels like a festival, the way all the street lamps are adorned with fresh flowers; the businesses shuttered for an hour; and the full population split between halves of the street. We stand in pattern between the onlookers and the empty road. The senior guards are busy on the city outskirts, demanding papers, and ensuring no Chymaeran spies are guising unwitting villagers. We hold the ceremonial rifles that we retrieved from the armory, clasped between our hands and upright, though Aldrin insists we "can't be fully trusted with them yet," and that we need to "train with a blade before we can handle them."
My eyes steady on the vacancy in front of me on the other side of the road, originally intended to be held by Bertram. Before long, the shimmering white carriage prattles down the road, drawn by two black horses. They're looking to have a two-nights'-stay in the hot springs, and we're meant to prove to them that Gaffesend is safe, encouraging more tourists to make the trek to enrich our lands.
I figure most of our population is excited for the presence of a Chosen Mask: we got the news that he was being paid to defend the carriage between villages. It's rare that anyone notable ever passes through, especially since we're the last stop before nothing. I can see him waving to his admirers from the coachman's seat as they cheer and throw flowers at the feet of the horses. Within the carriage, a finely-dressed family of six waves from the windows, wearing white and gold.
I feel my hands loosen their tension on the rifle. The nagging feeling of fear that's plagued me since forever is almost in the back seat, and around me, I can drink to the exuberance of the town. To my left, Naya smiles, predictably not the type to cheer. To my right, Pax pumps his fist in the air. And Bertram is absolutely focused on the royals, standing there directly in front of me.
The carriage is drawing closer, at least a hundred paces away. Some of the family's younger passengers have exited the carriage, walking alongside the road and tossing wrapped candies to the onlookers. The nagging feeling grows stronger. It's just too peaceful. And as my hands tension around the black steel, Bertram's eyes catch a glint of amethyst when he decides to make his move.


They're close enough to run me over, but my body's trained to react before I can think. Muscle memory comes before thought, thought before fear, and fear before true reaction, so it's only when I'm halfway across the road that the thoughts finally reach my muscles. The others are only beginning to notice when the Chymaeran fleshwalker raises the rifle. I'm the only one that happened to know enough and be close enough to respond, and when I try to take another step, I feel the gravity of my past flood my veins with molasses.
I struggle to refuse the defenses of my own mind. I always swear I can taste the smoke from that fire when my heartbeat rises. And as the Chymaeran assassin guising my friend prepares to take aim and pull the trigger, all I can do is watch as I collapse to the street, giving the horses such a start that they shy and snort, rearing on their hind legs, casting the carriage forwards and backwards.
Pax is quick on the uptake: for every dearth of common sense, he excels in his perception, tuned to that energy of the attacker. While the other junior guards only begin to notice, and the Chosen is left helpless in a battle of speed, the assassin pulls the trigger, spooking the horses and the spectators as Pax tackles him to the ground.
I brace my head with my cheek brushing moss between the roadway stones. The coachman pulls the slip knot, and the horses' hooves clatter against the road, and I hold my breath, as if it could change the chances of the startled stallions shattering my spine or ribs. But they clamber right overhead, and as the carriage passes directly over my prostrated body lying straight with the road, I feel the wetness of something dense drip across my cheek.
My ears still ring from the blast, but I can hear the cries of the children and the wife. And when I'm sure my whole body can still respond to its commands, I begin to crawl from beneath the carriage.
"May the gods damn your pathetic town and its useless guards," the wife says. "It should be wiped off the face of the map!"
I begin to imagine the repercussions, and I try to prepare myself for what's to come. I accept my fate to vanish from this program. I had my chance, and yet I couldn't even finish the job!
The Chosen drags me out from beneath the carriage with his gloved hands. A long streak of the husband's blood stains my bangs and trickles down my nose. When I look to the inside of the white carriage, emptied of its crying inhabitants and bright with a splatter of red, I find the husband taking shallow breaths as he holds his shoulder, tended to by the glowing hands of their family's hired healer.
The immaculately-dressed wife's jewelry clatters when she gets her hands around my collar, thrashing me as the Chosen hesitates to disarm his source of wealth. Her hands are already red with her lover's blood, clothes absent the pristine ivory white they surely struggled to sustain on such sultry trails.
"You cowering, yellow-bellied bitch," she exclaims. Her gloved hand batters my cheek with deafening leather contact. "You leach our tribute. You live to give your lives for us, and I'll be sure you don't see another sunrise in this line of work. The guard of this backwater town are a joke!"
I can feel my tears streaming, directly in the view of all my comrades that can only just stand there and watch. Jullian ducks his head when I meet his eyes. Naya freezes, her tail frayed. And Ryder and Pax are busy wrestling the Chymaeran as it tries to change forms. 
But I hear the husband. "Dear. That young guard is the reason my head is on my shoulders. I mean, Gods, if she hadn't given the horses a start..."
"She nearly got you killed!"
"The bullet did that," he says.
"But still," she says. The mercurial woman releases my collar and tensions her fists, letting out an exasperated cry. The side of my face aches as I slouch, wiping my tears with the unsullied parts of my arms, remembering not to dirty their carriage with contact from my body.
But it's the distress of the children that damages me the most. Standing on the other side of their life-altering trauma, facing such failure that I'm painted with the aggressor, the devastating shock registers on their faces, now devoid of sorrow, just speechless like I once was as they try to recalibrate their understanding of how horrifying the world can be. And all I want is to embrace them, to tell them that everything will be alright, to let them cry into my shoulder.
"You failed us. And you're going to pay for this," the wife screams at Aldrin when he approaches. "How are you going to make this right?"
"You'll make it right by apologizing to my officer," he says. "I don't care how much money you have, what role you play in the Empire, you will apologize for assaulting the woman who tried to save you!"
"And failed," she insists. "You're messing with Valensend blood--"
"You gave two days of warning for your arrival, refusing like all you rich types do to pay in advance, and then you have the gall to say we didn't prepare. It takes weeks!"
The woman tensions her fists. Two of children grasp her dress by the fabric. I draw deep breaths to make the blood flow back into my fingers and legs, all the while feeling like I'm stealing a resource I no longer deserve.
But I hear the father's voice behind me. "She would have complained the same if it was just a scare: I would have stopped her if I had the strength. As far as I'm concerned, you saved my life."
"But I hesitated. I saved no one. It was luck."
"Luck or not, you're a reason my children still have a father," he says. I turn around. He gestures for the servant and the healer to tend to my scratches, and with a quick wave of a hand, I feel the sting slowly dissipate from my face.
He reaches from the open door, dabbing his blood from my skin with a clean corner of a towel, ensuring that nothing ill will come of this. Behind us, the two continue to argue as senior guards apprehend the battered Chymaeran assassin. It's only when I see the assailant's guise of my cherished friend that I remember the absence of the real one.
I release an unintelligible string of words before the panic peaks inside me once again. Aldrin shouts. Two of my friends try to stop me, and the woman screams of my cowardice, but all I can think of is what I learned it takes for a Chymaeran to steal a guise.
I run as fast as my feet will take me, choosing to try and save another, even if it means damnation for leaving this all behind.


==============================================
    CHAPTER ELEVEN
==============================================


I can only work as fast as the computer will take me. I've spent so many hours between renders imagining how I would boost the performance if IT gave me a blank check and I was then the bottleneck -- although a workstation laptop is nice to take home, it has nothing over one of those stationary rigs that the Robinson-Monroe lifers were grandfathered into.
They gave me the laptop two years ago, and it hasn't been updated since. One day I booted into BIOS to see if I could overclock it, or take it to its limits. But IT's Great Wall of Control knows no bounds, so all I can do is sit here for twenty minutes at a time before I notice the changes in the drawing are applied.
Those twenty minutes are silent. Only Wilbur and I sit in the row, and we're not even across from each other. Reed filled in the spot that the last escapee left behind, and although I was eager for months to move next to Kei and take the next steps, Navesh insisted it was a "major waste of time." I feel like Wilbur and I have exhausted every topic across the generational gap: his kids, when I plan to marry, if I have a serious girlfriend yet, cars, and sports. Every day I hear his wake apnea over the partitions, and sometimes I wonder if it's the perfect cover for him to be sleeping.
The computer still holds an hourglass. It's midday, and the neighboring row is filled with chatter. I hear Reed's voice the most often, and a little too often: if golden retrievers could design and code, and the connotation didn't imply he was stupid, I think it would fit him well. Kei acknowledges his musings here and there, but is always so focused that she spits no more than a couple words.
I check the calendar in the lower right corner of my screen. Fall is fast approaching, and when I count, it's been almost four weeks since I moved in. Four weekends of my parents coming over to visit, bringing over one of my favorite home-cooked meals, allowing them to ask when they'll have grandkids now that I have a house. Four weeks since I lost my brother's classic IPod, so now I listen to music on my phone. But also four weeks without drinking: most days I just go home, spend an hour on the computer scrolling my list of games, trying to convince myself to play something, and then go to sleep early unless I go to the gym with Miguel.
Reed keeps rambling on about sports and hobbies, and the more I just sit there -- helpless to walk over or else I'll look lonely and desperate -- the more I wonder if I'm getting the right dose of meds. The longer time drags, and the later into my twenties it gets, the further I feel from the spurious passion of those college years where it was forced out of me. It's like being at the bottom of a dark pool, or a distant game of telephone recalling how I last recalled those moments. My vocal cords feel neglected for how little use they get, and like an unmotivated violinist, I've been unpracticed for a while.
The render loads. It breaks the entire assembly, and I have another three keystrokes before I wait even longer.
"Hey, Reed. Good job on the redline today," Nav says. "I hope you've been getting used to the software?"
"Of course," he says. "Kei has been teaching me well. And Cody over there, too."
I count the green-stamped pages on my desk. Three I've completed today. Maybe they just forget I work here?
"So anyways. I want the three junior engineers to follow me," Nav says. I duck my head to look busy when he comes over. "Cody, can you follow us?"
"Sure, Nav," I tell him.
We gather in one of the small meeting rooms. I sit first near the door, then Kei and Reed sit together on the far side. Nav makes small talk when he's plugging in his laptop. "I haven't seen you at any of the happy hours, Cody," he says. "The whole team was there last week: what have you been so busy with?"
"I even got Kei to go once," Reed says. "And she's usually busy all the time!"
Kei smiles. "Yeah, I guess I can admit last week was a little fun. Even if it's just talking about guy stuff at a sports bar."
Reed looks at me earnestly. I can tell that he means it. "You should come." He reminds me of my business major roommates in college, except before I had a legitimate excuse.
"Yeah. Sounds like fun."
"Well, tonight's the night. We were thinking Chili's," Nav says. "And you all have been doing great, so I thought I'd buy you all a drink."
"Cheers to that!" Reed exclaims, raising an imaginary glass as I take a long draw of an energy drink. Nav flicks on the projector. His screen comes into focus, with a presentation labeled INTERMITTENT APPRENTICE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, BY NAVESH D. PRATEL.
"So I've been looking for ways to keep us busy. Things have been rather slow, and with Scott leaving and all --"
"Scott's leaving?" We say in near unison.
"Yeah. Oh, shoot -- I was supposed to wait until Monday, gosh darn it," he says. "Keep this between us."
"And what's going to happen?" Kei asks.
"I don't know, with the hiring freeze and all, maybe something will come from within," Nav says. He winks so hard I think I hear it. "Anyways, on an unrelated note, I have a project to keep you guys busy, instead of vanishing early to go to Starbucks."
"Awesome," Reed says, but literally.
"We spend forever just designing and redesigning what already exists. It's what most of engineering is if you're not R and D, after all." 
Next slide.
A 90's clip-art image of batteries is on the screen, each with little faces, shaking hands like little powered businessmen. I nearly laugh and I have to cover my mouth.
"You spend so much time doing redlines as support engineers that you don't get to feel what it's like to come up with something. Surely you felt it in college. Maybe you've missed it."
I nod almost as excitedly as Reed does.
"Enclosures, and more enclosures. Modifying dimensions of existing batteries by the smallest hair to please a customer's plans. Well, I want you all to take a shot at designing something entirely new," Nav says. "You should know how batteries work from experience, not just designing the stuff they're housed in."
"Yes, a million times yes," Reed says, and even Kei looks slightly invested.
The next slide is a cross-section of a battery scanned from one of the lifers' textbooks, with such hand-drawn beauty there's no doubt it came from the seventies. I relish that it's finally something I'm good at, involving all the robotics I love to do in my garage.
"What happens is a redox reaction, or reduction-oxidation," Nav says, sounding like my Circuits professor if he was twenty years older. "The anode has electron-rich elements like zinc, so it's negative. The cathode has elements like silver, so it's positive, and when you connect a wire from one to the other, you get electron flow."
Next slide.
"We typically do nickel-cadmium or lithium-ion, far better than the lead-acid ones. Then there's nickel-metal-hydride . . ." 
He drones on and on. With the energy drink death-gripped in my hand, I manage to stay awake: Reed can do it without anything. I decide to just wait for the email with the PowerPoint.
"And, with all these considerations, your task will be to design an optimal battery, given a set volume. You'll do some theory, then we'll use the multimillion-dollar battery lab the R&D guys seem to have forgotten about."
"That's great," Reed says.
"How far you go with this project is up to you, and what you take from it is very important. You'll be doing this between redlines, getting feedback from Senior engineers, so that you design the best battery possible, and safely," he says, closing his laptop. "We'll be starting next week. And since it's Friday, maybe we can talk about it at Happy Hour."
We all stand from the table. My foot falls asleep pretzeled on my other leg, so I stumble towards the door last. But before I can exit, Reed stops me.


"Hey bro. I was thinking we could talk about the project later," he says.
What is this, an undergrad lab? Is there a grade?
"Yeah, that'd be cool," I say.
"What's your phone number? I already got Kei's last week. I was thinking we could make a group chat," he says.
"Uh, yeah, man, sure." I take his phone. I enter CODY WORK in the top, and the ten digits in the box. He shoots me a text of the first three emojis in his "recent" bar, and then proceeds to make the group message right then and there.
"Cool!" He says. "I was thinking, you look like you lift. Would you be down to lift before Monday?"
I hardly even get in the door on time, dude, I want to tell him, but I'm short on friends and his energy is nostalgic for friends in a time long past. "Sure, I would like that," I tell him.
"Great! I'll send you the one I go to. You can use my membership," he insists.
I nod my head, still in my cooldown period for using "cool," "great," or "dope."
The rest of the day passes slowly. I draw a couple concepts for the enclosure on sheets of TOPS engineering paper, an empty pad from never designing anything new. The late hour comes, and when the others begin to make their egress, it's just Kei and I.
After shutting down. I pass her while she's deep in a design project. I'm surprised she notices.
"Quite the eager guy, isn't he," she says.
"Who, Reed?"
"Yeah." She laughs. "Reminds me of you when you started here."
"Oh, you mean before my soul got sucked from my body?" I approach her, pulling down my eyelids and rolling my eyes to expose the bloodshot whites. "Can you see it in there? Is it still alive?"
She draws close to take a glance, and I catch a smell of familiar perfume from a date long forgotten. "Just enough, I think."
I say, "I don't have energy like he does. That's for sure. And . . . it's lonely over there. Wilbur just snores all day, unless he's bashing his keyboard and cursing at the new software."
"Well, then maybe I could make up for it," she says. But she's still focused on her drawing.
"What do you mean?" I ask.
"I mean we could hang out sometime. Like, outside of work," she says.
My mind struggles to think of something platonic. "Oh. Like what?"
"I don't know. The kind of stuff we used to do. But before, before..."
Before that last summer before you left, I think. That was just Student Government stuff late in the evenings. Late work like this. I remember the last day of my junior year and her senior year, cleaning the room one last time as the Presidential cabinet, when I felt my heart swell in my chest with the apprehension of whether I was going to make my move. Time was running out. I had waited all year. The door was closed, and when she turned around, I pressed my lips to hers, and she dissolved into me, starting that perfect summer before she went--
"Cody? I said we could do dinner." I was staring at her lips the whole time. It's a miracle I didn't raise half a chub, thanks to the waistband trick.
"Yeah, that sounds great. I've got a couple Chuck E Cheese coupons I've been clipping out of the gazette."
"What the fuck?" She laughs, something I haven't heard in a while. "See, this is the part of you I miss. There's surely still a soul in there."
"I hope so," I say.
"I'll shoot you a text," she offers, just as Reed sends another message in our group chat. All I can think of is how we left it last: letting the chance of starting anew decay over four years of college. It never had a title, but the split was worse than any other relationship I've been in.
My mind is abuzz on the car ride home, so distracted the dark dissolves my sight of the exit gate, and I nearly ram it. I should be happy, but I feel some kind of sadness overtake me, and by the third light, I can feel my eyes well with tears. Maybe it's how fast the four weeks since moving in have gone. Maybe it's this unstructured emptiness into which my life retreats. Like Newton said about forces and stuff in motion, I feel like if nothing else ever acted on me, I'd float in this job at this level and at this social vapidness until I hit the mahogany wood of my coffin.
I don't know how Reed or my late brother Jackie seem to find it. That energy to reach beyond, and every time I reach the end of this line of thinking, I wish it was the one lesson my older brother could have passed down to me.


I toss my keys on the counter: the house is a moderate mess when my parents aren't coming the day after. I slip my hand down my pants and grab the TV remote (not for porn), fixing the sweaty adhesion I'd dealt with since the afternoon.
Reed messages about the happy hour in the involuntary group chat. He reminds me of my brother. And, surprisingly, Kei says she's going, too.
They ask me if I'm coming, but the darkness of the foyer is too comfortable. All I want is to do nothing, so the minutes pass until the hour passes and I still haven't responded, just sitting there, wondering why I don't feel much of anything.
Before long I'm lost in dreamless sleep, and the next moment, I awake in my boxers to a loud disturbance next door. The oven clock reads 2:17 AM. There's a loud banging on the door. It's that strange adjoining door, connecting my flat with my neighbor's. Beyond the odd noises from the adjoining townhouse, I haven't touched the over engineered doorstop since.
"Help me, please," the voice pleads, in an accent or a dialect I can hardly understand.
I stumble through blackness for the door.
"Cody," she sobs.

==============================================
    CHAPTER TWELVE
==============================================


Calling his name will do nothing. I decide ahead of time to break in instead of patiently knocking, hoping the others piece together my purpose for panic instead of thinking I'm just deserting. My two friends are built like bricks, but it's all the muscle that helps in a sprint. If Bertram's house were any further than three blocks, they might have fallen behind. My legs are long and my conditioning is great, but it's not enough. I feel one of them lift me into the air as I continue to struggle, like a rabbit caught in an eagle's clutches.
"Let me go! He's not out sick, he's dying," I say.
"I know," Ryder says. "I checked the Chymaeran's things. He didn't have a Guise Marker on him, so he didn't have the time to sever a finger. You know it takes a while to process."
"It wasn't meant to be a permanent guise. It was just for a moment, so it's off blood. That means Bertram has to be alive to keep it going," Pax says.
"You're not doing this alone," says Ryder, finally putting me down. "We're going to help him together."
"Fine. But the guise isn't active anymore," I tell them, as we begin to run at even pace. "He has no need to be alive."
We pass the market street, then sprint along the road at the edge of the lake. I collect speed with distance, and by the time we arrive at Bertram's gate, I leverage all my Essence and anger against his door, bashing my armored shoulder against the painted wood.
The door splits in splintered halves. The dust and sawdust coalesce in dark, floating motes as the sun casts ribbons of light through the entryway, and I squint my eyes to adjust to the darkness of his house. There is not a sound to tell his whereabouts. We enter the kitchen to find the window ajar with the curtains fluttering, the same window I use to trade for breakfast.
"He's not on the bottom floor," I say. It's just a single, long room that mixes the kitchen with a living space and dining area. None of the chairs are overturned, and the mess looks average for a single man.
We begin to climb the stairs. Pax insists on going first, followed by Ryder, followed by me, with my dagger drawn hilt-up. They know the hallway design is two rooms and a master, so they split off to take the other rooms, leaving me with the only place my friend can feasibly lie.
We throw the doors open at the same time. I hear no commotion from the other two, and as I approach the bed, I see the sheets are clean, crumpled with a pallid figure sweating in short trousers.
"Bertram," I say. 
He's breathing heavily, still unable to move, and veins of amethyst metastasize in a rash across his skin.
"Clear," the others report, entering the bedroom to find me kneeling beside his bed.
"How bad is it? Do you know?" I ask Pax. "He's breathing, and he's not bleeding, what did they do to him?"
Pax presses his fingers to Bertram's neck. The room gets colder as his fingertips flush with obsidian. "The guise is up, so he's not being drained any longer, but he'a really on the edge."
"Drained?" I ask.
"The blood," Pax says. "For a short guise like this that doesn't take a pound of flesh, it evaporates from his body every minute, damaging his organs. He'll wish he lost a finger instead."
"We need to heal him right away," I say, extending my hands, but Pax stops me.
"Human Essence will only make this worse. It's like treating frostburn with warm water."
"Then what do we do?" I ask.
"There's medicine at the base, but it's really up to him until we can get him there. He's got to fight," Pax says. "The worst is over, but I only know l as far as experimenting with my Chymaeran blood has gotten me. I'll still monitor the Curse."
"And I'll carry him," Ryder says.
"We need to keep him warm," I say. He's sweating so profusely, but I tuck the sheets around him, feeling his flesh is colder than ice. I press my head to his chest, listening to his faint heartbeat. "It's my turn to save you," I tell him, standing back as Ryder works to position him across the back of his shoulders.
Beyond his window, the curious villagers and guards begin to gather, and I pray that Aldrin will have the understanding. I follow Pax and Ryder to the gates of the base on the route of our daily walk, using Essence to help sustain his warmth beneath the blanket.

When we arrive, the spaces between the buildings are strangely vacant. The escaped horses are hitched back to the familiar carriage, parked at the side of the headquarters: surely the royals are elsewhere, enjoying the finest accommodations.  I can hear a loud group of guards and civilians within the walls. I lament the straight walk through the center of the building we'll have to take to get Bertram the attention he needs.
I can hear the voices of the commoners.
"If your guards were smart enough to know how to walk and run, we wouldn't be in this mess."
"You need to get rid of her. They need a gesture of our apology. Send her to the front lines immediately!"
"Oh, give her a break! Clumsy or not, she's the reason the patriarch is still alive."
All the heads turn when we enter. I'm the first to step in, and all the eyes fall on me.
"About time you come back after scampering off," a senior guard says.
"I wasn't 'scampering off,'" I tell him. "I was saving the other victim everyone forgot about."
Pax enters next, carrying the real Bertram in his arms now. He steps carefully between villagers seated on the floor.
"Gods above," another says.
I find Aldrin standing at the front of the room: his natural height is enough to demand attention. "This only proves further that today was far from a failure. I know you are all scared of repercussions, of tribute lost, but it doesn't change the fact that Gaffesend is vital to the defense of our homeland."
Since I'm able to catch my breath for the first time, I walk around the back of the room to stand beside Jullian, but he doesn't turn to me, focused on the words of our leader.
"I know it wasn't perfect. They're still learning, but they took action, and I want to recognize the bravery of Pax and Katiya, and their quick reactions to the evil vice of our enemy."
He raises his hands to try and start a cheer, but the room is quiet.
"We don't care about bravery, we care about safety. How can we be sure our village is really safe?" Someone says. The other villagers agree.
"This was an act to incite fear, to make it feel like a losing battle," Aldrin says. "It was an act of attacking the mind of a people, not an act of definite power!"
"But what if it was?" One of the farmers says. "I stare into the darkness every night in the southeast, how can I be sure of that?"
"We need more than just the professional guards, more than the army, we need everything you have!"
"Then we will do something about it."
"Do what? The empire will support us less after this!"
"We'll send out the junior guards," Aldrin says.
I can feel the freedom to choose, to be decidedly safe, dissolving away. The numbness returns to my fingers.
"Night missions. Indefinite night scouting missions, and during the day, too," Aldrin offers, the first thing that seems to quell the fears across the town hall. "No more idle quests, we'll place them at the threshold."
The cheer grows louder. My heart beats faster.
"We will do everything in our power to keep this town safe. And we'll re-institute the volunteer force if needed. I promise you," he says, and when I reach for a space behind Jullian to sit, the others stand.
Before long, the townies are leaving, satisfied enough with the answer. I reach for Jullian's hand, but he's gone without a word, and I feel like I deserve it.
I can feel the static on my flesh. When I'm far enough behind my friends, I stumble home, feeling the weakness begin to overtake me. My curling fingers fumble for the key. My name will be scratched off it soon. I'm too humiliated to ask for Jullian's comfort when he never stays in the first place, my other friend is fighting for his life, and it feels like the only option I have is to invoke the help of the stranger I shut out so many weeks ago.
I press desperately against the shelf as my body curls on itself, praying that the passageway is still there and I won't crumple in the closet. I crack the door, struggling to drive it against the bookshelf since I didn't push it far enough, trying to slide my body only to find a second door firmly locked in place.
I remember the strange name of the foreign language I can somehow understand, and I cry it like an incantation. 
"Cody. Help me, please," I beg, pounding on the door. "Cody!"
The door latches. I hear a shrill, ear-piercing screech sound from beneath my foot as something finesses heavy piece of metal bracing the door. His hand rips the screeching thing to pieces before he manages to leverage it open, killing the metallic creature mid-cry.
When the door opens, all I can manage is to collapse into his arms, and he embraces me, leading me into his foyer as the tears run from my eyes.
His voice is soothing as he tries to calm me. It's the only sense I have when my eyes are shut, trying to abate the fear of all the artifacts around me. I can feel my back settle into the comfortable couch where I found his friend sleeping, and he sits beside me, placing his arm around me at enough of a distance to prevent me from thinking that he's trying to make a move.
"So, uh, what happened?"
