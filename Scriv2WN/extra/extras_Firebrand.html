  <h1>Narrative Premise</h1>
  <blockquote>Frost, fire, and the cruel math of “one more try.”</blockquote>

  <p><strong>“Firebrand”</strong> (Book One of The Frostburn Chronicles) follows Titus Berguard, a valedictorian from a military academy in a frostbitten wasteland. As graduation nears, Titus and his friends—Sylvia, Romin, and Valentina—face the looming threat of service. When disaster strikes the last human city, Titus discovers he can rewrite the past. But with each reset, his friends forget everything, and Titus is left alone with the weight of every outcome.</p>

<p>With unlimited chances to rewrite the past in a world falling apart, when will anything ever be enough? <em>Firebrand</em> is a story of time travel, romance, friendship, and never giving up hope in a dying world.</p>

  <h1>Principal Characters</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Titus Berguard</strong> is a valedictorian Frostpunk who scavenges the wasteland to keep food on the table and his little
    sister safe. Brilliant and stubborn, he turns the time-loop into a weapon—until it turns into an addiction. His core struggle
    isn't courage; it's control.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Sylvia</strong> is Titus' closest ally and the story's central romance: a mysterious, sharp-edged survivor with red eyes and
    a past that never stops catching up. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Ellie</strong> is Titus' younger sister—his anchor and his vulnerability. Protecting her is simple in theory, brutal in practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Romin Zebal</strong> is Titus' best friend: loud, courageous, hungry for glory, and far more compassionate than his mouth suggests.
    He represents the life Titus keeps trying to “optimize” into a perfect outcome.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Valentina Vermillion</strong> is a wealthy actress caught in a scandal not of her making, desperate to be valued for something real.
    In a world built on survival, she forces Titus to confront what “worth” even means.
