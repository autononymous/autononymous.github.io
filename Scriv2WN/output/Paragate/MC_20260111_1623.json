They sent me home with expensive glass Tupperware containers that &quot;you can send home with Reed,&quot; packed with cuts of tri-tip Geoffrey seared and grilled.It has a whole two shelves of space to breathe in my fridge, besides a Costco trip from mom, Katiya&apos;s Chinese leftovers, and a rack of Pabst Blue Ribbon that gives me a taste of college.My muscles ache from the chatter of the machines. Micro-abrasions on my fingers sting with hand sanitizer, and I&apos;m about to head up to take a shower when I hear the sound of crying next door. So instead I grab the leftovers, inching my way through Katiya&apos;s door with a container, slow enough to not invoke the wrath of another stranger. I think it&apos;s Rayna at first glance, sitting on Katiya&apos;s couch in her foyer, but then there&apos;s a copy of her. They both look like Rayna. The double doesn&apos;t cry: she just stares at her reflection with piercing blue eyes. I knock on the door lightly, yet the two catgirls jump.&quot;Intruder!&quot; One of them says.&quot;Cody,&quot; Rayna says. The name brings the other to lower her weapon. &quot;What&apos;s happening this time? Did you duplicate yourself?&quot;&quot;This is Aryn,&quot; Rayna says, &quot;my sister.&quot;&quot;Who are you?&quot; Aryn asks, but she squints harder. &quot;Wait, I remember you &mdash; you were outside this house. The noble. That Royal Inventor that got the slice on the hand.&quot;&quot;That&apos;s me,&quot; I say, while Rayna sniffles. &quot;I heard crying next door. What&apos;s going on?&quot;&quot;An unexpected reunion. A dead girl walked into my town, and I found out that she&apos;s my sister.&quot; She turns back to Rayna, raising her voice again. &quot;Was Katiya hiding you here the whole time? Is that why she was so secretive?&quot;&quot;I&apos;m only here because I forced myself upon her goodwill,&quot; Rayna says. &quot;She has nothing to do with this.&quot;&quot;I thought she was mourning!&quot; Aryn slams the coffee table, and her sister jumps.&quot;She still is,&quot; Rayna says.&quot;I trusted her, and she used that trust to hide everything,&quot; Aryn says. &quot;You should have come to me. Or at least &mdash; why didn&apos;t you go home? Mom and Dad could have protected you. They would give anything.&quot;Rayna sniffles, lowering her head even further. &quot;So why, Rayna? Tell me,&quot; Aryn says, flashing the contours of her fangs. &quot;Now!&quot;&quot;Take it easy,&quot; I say. She glares hard enough to drive me back a couple steps, then tries to soften her voice, but the anger still abrades the words in her throat. &quot;Just tell me,&quot; Aryn says. &quot;Please&mdash;&quot;&quot;I couldn&apos;t bear it,&quot; Rayna says.&quot;Bear what?&quot; Aryn says.&quot;I couldn&apos;t bear to face you,&quot; Rayna says. &quot;But we swore to protect each other, no matter what, and I don&apos;t care if you&apos;re in trouble. You&apos;re my sister.&quot;&quot;I was better off dead to you. And that choice made you a whole lot greater than I could ever be, because you deserved&mdash;&quot;Aryn slaps her sister across the face, and Rayna recoils against the couch. &quot;You don&apos;t get to decide that for us. You made a promise,&quot; Aryn says, &quot;and you&apos;re so much more to me alive...&quot;Aryn raises her hand again, but it falls to her side. Rayna grasps her cheek. I can&apos;t shake the thought all I ever wanted, for years, was to yell the same way at my sibling after they left for the last time &mdash; but watching how it plays out secondhand is painful.&quot;Hey,&quot; I say. &quot;Let&apos;s continue next door. You both seem hungry.&quot;&quot;And why the Res would we do that?&quot; Aryn asks. &quot;You&apos;re interrupting something&mdash;&quot;I open the lid, and her expression quickly changes. &quot;Well . . . fine. But I&apos;m not even close to done with her.&quot;&quot;That&apos;s fine,&quot; I say, wedging the door back open with my foot as I accept it&apos;s going to be a long night. &quot;Sit down on the couch, and I&apos;ll prepare something for you.&quot;Aryn still hesitates. It&apos;s hard to convince cats to do anything, so I act indifferent, rushing in to shutter my shades to forestall a deluge of difficult questions. They enter my world with a few steps at a time, then deposit themselves on the couch, as Aryn gears up to deliver another verbal lashing, but she&apos;s forestalled by the oddness of my world.I toss the glassware in the microwave as I think of all the things I longed to tell him, the thoughts so fresh in my mind that they were almost practiced.And they&apos;re still there. It takes the full three presses of the microwave&apos;s START button to even start to sort them out, and by the time I&apos;m balancing the leftovers between two plates &mdash; and I serve them in the foyer &mdash; I open my mouth, feeling all the sadness of the last decade wash over me. When they see I&apos;ve stopped holding back, they listen: my body shivers when I return to living in his last moments, but this time, it&apos;s no longer forced upon me by a nightmare. A day of exhaustion tears back the mechanisms that might protect me, without space for isolation or irony to invent an escape.&quot;Even through all this anger, you have a chance to start again,&quot; I say. &quot;I never got that.&quot;They blink at me, hesitating to take their first bite until I finish the thought.&quot;There&apos;s not a second I&apos;ve lived since my brother died that I&apos;ve been able to call my own,&quot; I confess, then I gasp, and it startles me: struggling to remember the last time I ever choked on a feeling.",
