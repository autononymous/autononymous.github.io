  <div class="col-md-4">I have an old whiteboard that I hung by the neck
With confessions and letters to myself: “Be still a man”
I thought Hume could save me, but I was cause without an effect

And still what graced my whiteboard
After Hume passed quietly
A confession in black ink:
“You will always be like this.”

Then again in the amber
glowing dawn, hair sprouting jets of fire from their roots,
from caverns of bone,
I stumbled,
angry,
towards that whiteboard and drew a pen
intent to really call myself out:
“You won’t get better. Did you even try at all?”

I have an old whiteboard that I hung by the neck
“I want to be normal” is the last thing it said.
Boarded up like a condemned house 
with wedding invitations, the notes from my friends
a birthday card
a love letter
and a drawing of a squirrel.</div>
