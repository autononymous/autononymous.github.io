            <h4><center>1</center> </h4>
            <p> <font face="Times New Roman">A sea of snowflakes shook his flesh in frigid tremors, his hands clasped around the woven rope without a feeling for the twist of woven fiber. His breath tasted like poison. The air scraped down his throat as mucus saturated in his nose, blocking the heaving breaths that stung in his nostrils, but it was nice that the smell of rancid smoke had finally left him. He continued to tug at the sled, dragging it onwards as it protested on every root and bush buried beneath the snow, tugging arms too frozen to feel the frost as it numbed his flesh.</p>
  <p> But the worst hadn’t passed. The life of a Frostpunk wasn’t legal or easy: it was arduous and long, scraping for supplies that several hundred years had forgotten, and already, the nearest cabins and abandoned cities had been raided, scraped clean like every plate he forced his sister to eat, dry like every bottle his father finished after closing shop when the sun had just begun to rise, empty like the distant glare when he stared through him, no longer in the mood to engage or with enough energy to take his responsibilities as a father. </p>
<p>What always kept him busy was trying to convince himself of the truth that the world reset every hundred-or-so years, and all those other impossibilities that blew his mind, until the pain dissolved from his attention, and all that remained was the meditative whisper of the winds. He wondered how long it had been since the Fall Of Nordhaven: when the humans retreated from their capital city to the last haven behind the walls of Blackwater. The royal family was dead. There were no ties to royalty anymore. The city was desperate. Their essence was exhausted in the resistance, and after centuries of life behind the comfort of two stories of stone walls, the tales of the past had dissolved from their attention, and the danger of the Chymaera beyond the city walls was forgotten.</p>
<p>History became obsolete to them. It invoked the fear of an early demise, and all people cared for was the comfort and peace of their homes, despite the charred lungs that killed so many at a young age if they didn’t get in the habit of covering their face with a scarf, and only worse for the workers who shoveled coal and essence into the furnaces. They often died at the age of twenty-five, packing the only heat and energy that would keep their people alive when the city of millions filled up with snow like an icebox, or like the washbasins in the abandoned houses where the roof had collapsed from the weight of the snow (since the houses back then were only designed for light snow and summer weather.) History triggered the lamentations of fear that poisoned their dreams. It echoed in the nervous laughter of their celebrations, shrouding their eyes like blankets of a child’s bed, convinced their walls were impermeable, that if they hid their head below the covers that the monsters could never consume them.</p>
<p>His throat scratched with the poisonous taste of exhaustion on his breath, snowshoes woven with old fabric from the couch that used to sit in the family room, until all the extra space turned his father’s stomach and he sold all the things that were  saturated with the smell of lavender, masking the fragrance with pungent liquor that made it really difficult to sell the house. But that was the last memory he had of her, and he never returned down the same street since; sleeping in the storeroom of the shop on a sack that smelled like salmon in the sun for hours at a time, sending his son to sneak beyond the walls to find more relics when he wasn’t at the Academy training to be a soldier.</p>
<p>The city lights had already disappeared in the blizzard. There was never blue sky, and he imagined it was punishment since the city blew smoke in the faces of the Gods. At least he traded all the charcoal clouds for frozen flakes, although without the warmth he shivered in his boots, praying for a house to take shelter from the storm since the pine trees could only cover him so much.</p>
<p>His family’s operation grew further and more desperate: the Frostpunks had already exhausted every face of the mountains that could be seen from the city. No wonder they were seen as rats, the way they buried their heads between every crevasse in the landscape for an untouched crumb in tattered rags that wreaked with age, frostbite riddled across their fingers if they didn’t have a pair of gloves, but after ten years, Titus knew exactly where to bury his head, and it didn’t matter if a thousand trips awaited him. He would protect her no matter the cost: for his mother, against his father, as the love that burned in his heart as ambition and strength in the Academy, the passion that compelled him to relentless training and endless motion, the same flame that warmed his fingers as he dragged the sled beyond the peak, glancing at all the battered houses below him, knowing he’d be forced to sleep in one of them as the temperature plummeted, or else he’d end up as one of the frozen corpses.</p>
<p> He prayed for strong craftsmanship and sturdy ceilings as the darkness dissolved the trees against the sky, kept conscious by the thought of her face and the flickering torch light. </p>
<p>The frost glassed his eyes with the gravity of sleep.</p>
