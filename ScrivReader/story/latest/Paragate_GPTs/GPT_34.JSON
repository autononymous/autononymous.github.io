      "&emsp;When I rise from four hours of sleep, I find that same feeling of dread I found in college when the world finally caught up with me, when I remembered it was a heavy day of finals. But this was a test I couldn&apos;t study for.",
      "&emsp;I usually leave no later than 6:30, but I awoke around 5:00, finding the knight still sleeping next to me. But it was like waking from a restless night with a severe cold, because once my conscious mind became aware of the great discomfort, there wasn&apos;t a chance I would be able to get myself back to sleep.",
      "&emsp;I thought of leaving early. Maybe if I showered and made it in when the early risers do &mdash; like Reed and Kei &mdash; I could leave earlier and still finish eight hours of work, but then any odd action might be an admission of guilt, and surely they would know what I was trying to do. So I couldn&apos;t go in late, either: I would have to go in at exactly the same time, acting none the wiser, as if a wide-sweeping investigation wouldn&apos;t be stalking me as soon as my badge number registered on the door&apos;s security console.",
      "&emsp;So all I could do was lay there with my thoughts like I did last night. Last night I was tempted to re-read the email for the tenth time, but I didn&apos;t want the bright screen to wake the girl sleeping next to me, and I knew it wasn&apos;t good for me either, so I just let the thoughts run their course like a fever until my mind was too exhausted to trouble me any further. By the time Katiya noticed enough to wrap her arm around me, suffusing me with the warmth of her otherworldly touch, I found just enough comfort to pass out.",
      "&emsp;But now I rest uncomfortably as the room glows brighter with each passing minute, longing for another sense of touch and warmth. It isn&apos;t fear I feel. I&apos;m more frightened of how unafraid I am, pulled back to the depths of my apathetic exhaustion that covers me like a wet blanket although the sheets that wrap around me are dry. Maybe last night I could find a couple tears before my body misconstrued my attempt at exorcising that long-forgotten emotion for a yawn, but as the clock finally reaches the time I&apos;m set to rise, I only have enough energy to shower and dress myself. I wear Navidson-Monroe blue with the logo proudly emblazoned on the breast pocket, and I tuck it into jeans with a belt. My stomach is too empty to fill, so I bring nothing to work with me, fully expecting to be out by midday at a bar somewhere.",
      "&emsp;The rain starts sometime before I pull out of the garage, and the ride is silent when music can&apos;t quell the anticipation: instead the raindrops patter in a continuous drumroll against the metallic roof; all sound without tonic or resolution.",
      "&emsp;I&apos;m walking up the concrete stairs before I even realize that I parked, and I can&apos;t even remember where. Dodging between hallways feels like playing paintball in close quarters until I make it to my desk at the exact average time I get in every day, but the discomfort catches up with me. Maybe it&apos;s the breakfast I skipped, or the sleeplessness, or the call of the void that left me without an appetite, dragging me to the bathroom to slam the stall door shut to get on my knees and lose the nothing I ate before this, dry-retching as someone else quickly washes their hands and vacates the bathroom.",
      "&emsp;I wipe and rinse my mouth several times before I leave, turning the corner to start down the long hallway of half-height cubicles. Several unfamiliar heads float above the partitions on the left side &mdash; my side &mdash; and I frantically count how far down they are, whether they&apos;re looking for me, and whom they&apos;re talking to.",
      "&emsp;But there&apos;s no stopping on the direct route to my desk, and I try to quell the feverish feeling as inevitability drags me closer, noticing they&apos;re in my row, asking Wilbur something.",
      "&emsp;I turn the corner, ready to weigh the level of recognition in their faces. My heart races, but my face remains still, as I try to turn a play at confusion into a joke.",
      "&emsp;&quot;You fellas lost?&quot; I ask.",
      "&emsp;They respond with another question."
    ],
    [
      "&emsp;When I arrive in the west-facing conference room, flanked by a phalanx of employees I&apos;ve never met before, I find the shutter shades drawn so tightly that the only glow in the room comes from their laptop screens. From the long chain of tables spanning most of the room, with three chairs on one side and seven on the other, I can tell the seating is assigned since there&apos;s only one spot left to fill.",
      "&emsp;Naveen sits in the left chair, and my father sits in the right, still refusing to turn and face me as the outlines of seven unfamiliar people on the other side of the table block the faint glow from between the shades.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Why don&apos;t you have a seat, Cody,&quot; someone says, and I find my place between my two mentors. But calmly, and it discomforts me more than all the things I know are coming. Now is the time to be afraid: yet I find the fear isn&apos;t there, and as they shuffle through their manila folders for notes to start the meeting, I feel like I&apos;m watching myself from the corner of the room.",
      "&emsp;Usually I&apos;m fighting the waves of my depression for a spark of energy, but for the first time, I&apos;m almost glad there&apos;s nothing left. The representative from Internal Affairs opens his mouth to start us off, and I realize I might be too absent to feel the heat.",
      "&emsp;The recorder clicks. ",
      "&emsp;We state our names and the hour, and then they say they&apos;re only &quot;finding facts,&quot; and to &quot;say only what you know firsthand,&quot; and that &quot;there&apos;s no blame yet for anything.&quot; But when the still image of my silhouette shows on the first projector slide, I&apos;m not sure I believe them.",
      "&emsp;&quot;So there was something odd that happened late last week.&quot; The rep from IA drags his finger across a sheet of paper that&apos;s been meticulously highlighted. &quot;At five thirty-four PM, someone entered the advanced technology lab with Alan Dunsmore&apos;s credentials when he was already logged out of the system. And yet Alan was already clocked-out: he left at 5:08, within the ten-minute time window specified by his union contract.&quot;",
      "&emsp;Alan&apos;s union rep nods, writing something down. The HR lady records the words on her laptop with a flurry of keystrokes, the only other sound in the room beyond the low hum of the outdoor heating unit. I feel my father tap his foot against the floor until he realizes we can feel it, and yet Nav is perfectly still.",
      "&emsp;I can feel that first question coming, the one I&apos;ve been waiting for since the email, and after a whole night of mentally debating myself over the best approach, I find I have no emotion left to obscure the clarity of the right answer.",
      "&emsp;&quot;But Navidson-Monroe office staff are not required to clock out. Their badges are only read when they enter through one of the four office or warehouse doors. We do know, however, that an engineer&apos;s computer was active until exactly 5:23, when he logged out.&quot; ",
      "&emsp;He&apos;s building the case with the anticipation that I&apos;ll try to deny it, and when he points his ballpoint pen at me, leveraging a cold, corporate stare that&apos;s devoid of malice, he finally gets to the question.",
      "&emsp;&quot;And where were you, then, Cody?&quot;",
      "&emsp;I clear my throat.",
      "&emsp;&quot;At 5:23?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Yes, around that time. What were you doing?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I was logging off my computer,&quot; I say. &quot;That computer.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;And then, where did you&mdash;&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;&mdash;I went down to the battery lab to test my prototype for the entry-level learning project.&quot;",
      "&emsp;The room halts. The two men I&apos;m sitting with turn to me, but it&apos;s not a gasp of revelation. It&apos;s a different surprise when they thumb past the first twenty pages of notes, expecting that they would have to work me over harder for the first confession.",
      "&emsp;&quot;So it was you that was in there,&quot; the Lead says. ",
      "&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; I say.",
      "&emsp;&quot;And would you mind telling us how you got in?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I was under the impression that it was an open lab, as long as the safety course was complete. I&apos;ve been using the CAL-04 bench for the last month. I was told it would be left open for Reed and I to test our projects between other assignments.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;And who told you that?&quot;",
      "&emsp;I turn to Nav, but not completely. I&apos;m not trying to hang my boss out to dry, even if I know he told us on the first day.",
      "&emsp;But he speaks up. &quot;No, it was I that told Reed and Cody.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;And who gave you permission?&quot;",
      "&emsp;Nav starts, &quot;It was&mdash;&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;&mdash;It&apos;s been an unspoken agreement for almost a decade,&quot; my father says. &quot;Any time there are entry-level engineers running their projects, we try to leave it open.&quot;",
      "&emsp;And then the Quality Assurance director speaks. &quot;Gentlemen, there&apos;s a reason we have SOP&apos;s. It&apos;s so we can formalize these things.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;SOP&apos;s require tasks under billable hours, and this doesn&apos;t fall under that,&quot; Nav says. &quot;It&apos;s a rare case where testing is done for experience, not financial gain.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;But he certainly can&apos;t be operating without a lead present,&quot; the safety director says. &quot;The nature of these projects happening without operating procedures is a big problem we&apos;ll talk about later. But this engineer can&apos;t be in there without a supervisor!&quot;",
      "&emsp;The Lead adds, &quot;was he given permission by his manager?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;He was not,&quot; Nav says.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Then Cody,&quot; he asks, &quot;why were you in there?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I was there because I&apos;m running out of time to present my battery project, and though it&apos;s passable, I want to prove I can do even better.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;But your calendar says the presentation isn&apos;t due for another three weeks,&quot; the Lead says. &quot;If you have time, why did you choose to work after hours?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I &hellip; I was particularly motivated that day.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Motivated? As in&hellip;&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Pressured,&quot; I say.",
      "&emsp;&quot;How were you pressured? Was it a coerced act?&quot; He asks.",
      "&emsp;&quot;I was pressured to perform because it was the day I learned that management thinks I&apos;m not good at my job. Or not good enough &hellip;&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Cody,&quot; Nav mutters.",
      "&emsp;&quot;I wasn&apos;t raised to quit, but I was raised to work harder, even if my skills are subpar. I was in there to test a new idea I had for the project.&quot; The words anger my father, but he&apos;s not mad at me.",
      "&emsp;The Lead closes the manila folder, perching with his elbows on the tan cover as he draws a deep breath. ",
      "&emsp;&quot;Look, Cody, even if you were convinced you were finding a cure for cancer or had the noblest of reasons to be down there, it doesn&apos;t change the fact that the Department of Defense is &hellip; discontented, that one of their golden samples was disconnected.&quot; He opens the folder again, thumbing through pages of terminal records. &quot;We could ask about the strange results, and it would be fine to assume it&apos;s just an amateur operator. We could ask about the HVAC system reporting a significant chill when you ran the first test, but that isn&apos;t what matters. What matters is how we show reconciliation for a multimillion-dollar government project that costs tens of thousands of dollars a day, and the fact that the project was halted due to negligence,&quot; then pauses to look at me &mdash; &quot;negligence of someone that shouldn&apos;t be in there in the first place, and we have to provide corrective action.&quot;",
      "&emsp;I bow my head as I await the final sentence. But my father&apos;s anger releases with an admonition.",
      "&emsp;&quot;My son was just following instructions,&quot; Alan says.",
      "&emsp;I say, &quot;there were no instructions. I acted on my own&mdash;&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I clipped the seal,&quot; Alan says.",
      "&emsp;The entire room turns to look at him.",
      "&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Mr. Dunsmore, what did you say?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Dad,&quot; I say.",
      "&emsp;&quot;I said I clipped the seal. I told my son he could use CAL-04 that day, and only realized I promised him after I started running the test. I&apos;m not going to let my own son cover for my stupidity.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Dad, that&apos;s not&mdash;&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I was going to run it the next morning. You see the test log was dated a day later?&quot; He gestures to the page as they flip through their folders. &quot;I was planning to run it the next day, and I figured I would just change the identification number.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re a lead, Alan. A technician level four, and you should have known better: we don&apos;t hot-swap numbers under the table!&quot;",
      "&emsp;Alan&apos;s union representative looks confused at the revelation: he can sense the same lie that I do. &quot;Now, gentlemen and ladies, look, I think Alan is confused here. He just told me before the meeting&mdash;&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;And you&apos;re saying you gave your son permission?&quot; The IA lead asks.",
      "&emsp;I can see Dad rewriting history as we go along. His back is turned so I can&apos;t see his face. &quot;I bet you found he used my number instead of my card, right? Because I told him. 0-6-0-8.&quot;",
      "&emsp;I say, &quot;But I clipped it. I clipped the identifier&mdash;&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Stop lying, Cody!&quot; My father looks furious. He sweats at his self-immolation.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Then what about Cody&apos;s sample?&quot;"
    ],
    [
      "&emsp;The men of the Dunsmore family are the best at taking bullets. And as the only one left whose number hasn&apos;t been called, I carry enough survivor&apos;s guilt for the three of us.",
      "&emsp;I was prepared to be vanished today. The private sector dodges a lot of the slow, bureaucratic cycle of government, and I was sure they&apos;d already drawn the documents for my termination, but they left themselves another option just in case. So after they got their pound of flesh through my father, I was no longer essential to taking the full force of punishment.",
      "&emsp;Maybe the other technicians didn&apos;t notice when my father was escorted out of the large steel door because he wasn&apos;t wheeling out his toolbox. No matter the result, I would end up turning in my work laptop by the end of the day, trading one line of work for another, where I was forced to follow in my father&apos;s footsteps, stripped of the pride offered by my degree. As of Monday, November 30, I made the lateral transition to assume the role of an entry-level mechanical technician, survived by a rusty red box of tools that I still don&apos;t know the half of, left to look up through the office window at a realm that is no longer privileged to me.",
      "&emsp;The only real explanation I got was from Nav. He gave me ten minutes in an abandoned conference room before they repossessed all my stuff, saying he would explain my plight to the others and mitigate all the humiliation, though I&apos;d be the first thing they saw looking out the window to the shop floor. He was at least the one that tried to stand up for me: as they chose my fate in a few minutes, he protested that I was a new entry-level engineer being dropped like a hot rock into a competitive market. So after they decided to let me stay under austere conditions, Nav explained that it was &quot;my chance to walk away quietly, with a shred of dignity and a believable lie.&quot;",
      "&emsp;I didn&apos;t even get to see my father after he left, but I don&apos;t think he wanted to be seen. I think his anger was real. I think he thought I expected him to save me: maybe he thought it was his role as my father to gish-gallop the room into a mess of threads that couldn&apos;t be untangled, painting the target on his back so brightly that they could only shoot him. The last I saw was the same expression he wore for months after he got the news about my brother, shouldering a crushing truth by only ever lifting with his back and never asking for help.",
      "&emsp;I hate the way I am, but I can&apos;t separate myself from who I am, so I think I really just hate myself, and right now, I really, really hate myself. Has this apathy castrated me so much that I&apos;ve lost the will to fight, or to care at all? What if I begged, or broke down, or got angry, or lost it, or whatever &mdash; enough to make them feel they got their justice? And what if I cared enough about my father&apos;s pride to extinguish his act of suicide?"
