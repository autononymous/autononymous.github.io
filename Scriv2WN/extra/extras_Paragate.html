<h1> Narrative Premise </h1>
<blockquote>Two worlds. One door. No clean escape.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Knightfall & Daybreak</strong> (aka <strong>Paragate</strong>) is a modern fantasy romance about two exhausted young adults living in different worlds—and the dangerous relief they find in each other's.</p>
<p>Cody, a burned-out aerospace engineer in suburban Colorado, and Katiya, a probationary knight in a war-scarred fantasy city, discover their homes are connected by a doorway that shouldn't exist. Each world offers the other exactly what they're missing: escape, validation, and the illusion of peace. But indulgence has a cost. As careers implode, wars encroach, and secrets compound, Cody and Katiya must decide whether love is a refuge from reality &mdash; or a reason to finally face it.</p>
<p>Portal fantasy meets grounded adult drama, where anxiety, depression, ambition, and devotion collide—and running away is the most tempting magic of all. </p>

<h1>Principal Characters</h1>

<p><strong>Cody Dunsmore</strong> is a junior aerospace engineer whose dream job has quietly hollowed him out. Smart, capable, and increasingly invisible at work, Cody is caught between professional ambition and the creeping fear that his best years are already behind him. The doorway offers him wonder, purpose, and someone who actually needs him—but also the temptation to abandon the life he’s supposed to build.</p>

<p><strong>Katiya Breakey-Hilde</strong> is a probationary Royal Guard stationed in the frontier town of Gaffesend, where proximity to war turns mistakes into death sentences. Trained to protect others but crippled by fear of failure, Katiya struggles with anxiety, public shame, and the constant threat of being sent to the front lines. Cody’s world offers warmth, safety, and the illusion of normalcy—but choosing it may cost her everything she’s fought to become.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting Characters</strong> include fellow cadets, corporate rivals, family members, and refugees whose lives complicate Cody and Katiya’s choices, reinforcing the central question of the story: when escape is easy, what is responsibility worth?</p>
