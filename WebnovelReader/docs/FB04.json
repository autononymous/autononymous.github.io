<p>&emsp;I grasp my chest where the dagger protrudes from between my ribs. Blood collects in my mouth as I cough crimson, every spurious fit driving the sharp edge deeper into my flesh as I sprawl against the deep, crumbling walls of the Undercroft, in a cavern so far below the mountains of the Afterlife. But the pain is so slowly fading away, along with the composure to form thoughts.</p>
<p>&emsp;My memories spill from the crack in my skull when the rock struck my head. I can see my vision feathering away. The names of friends and adversaries blur until they&apos;re primal feelings, and as I struggle to hold on to my thoughts &mdash; at least until the Thread can bring me back &mdash; I can feel the ground tremble beneath my feet at another failure.</p>
<p>&emsp;The Goddess stands in her tremendous form, shouldering the weight of the upper floors of the Undercroft, watching me bleed out without any chance for salvation, and though my senses have gone numb, I cry out with anguish when I can&apos;t remember her name.</p>
<p>&emsp;The cross-blooded Mask is crumpled on the ground across from me: impaled through her chest by the sharp end of a scythe, and though she brought the torment that destroyed the entire city of . . . of the city, I feel a similar feeling of anguish in watching a piece of me die.</p>
<p>&emsp;But it&apos;s the old man that reaches for the spade that concerns me the most. It will all be for naught if I don&apos;t kill myself first. And so I find my limbs still willing to obey my commands in the absence of pain. They run on the last spark of energy, and when I lift myself from the wall, limping towards the stubborn old man dragging himself across the floor, I stumble.</p>
<p>&emsp;His lips are still able to form words. &quot;You can&apos;t go back there all the way, my son. You will never be able to go back there! Why do you hold so tightly to a defeated world? &quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I grumble incoherent words, trudging further as my vision loses its color. The entire mountain is now shouldered by the strength of the Goddess, but it wavers, casting a hastening staccato of stones in the spaces around us.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let me return,&quot; he pleads. &quot;I&apos;ll unwrite all of this. As many times as it takes to save you. To save our people. To save our family from what happened in that cabin. To go back further! To bring you into a world free from all this chaos. To actually be your father, and for you and your sister to live in a loving fami&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;A falling boulder crushes his ribs, taking the words from his mouth. All that&apos;s left is the faculties of his mind: the two of us in a battle of death since this one ends in a stalemate.</p>
<p>&emsp;I should be used to dying at this point. Yet I can&apos;t even remember the first time it happened. I can&apos;t even remember the names of the full fireteam I lost to get here; of my adopted family; of my cherished best friends or the woman I never got to tell that I love her.</p>
<p>&emsp;Fate decides for us when we hold that hesitation to die. Even the Goddess refuses to let me die. The shadow of a great stone column shades my surroundings. The Thread on my wrist throbs as it glows with the light of life, and as it begins to drag my consciousness with an inertia that spans time, I can see myself standing there on that stage all those months ago. And as my father tries to&mdash;</p>

<p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;say that if there is anything, dear Firebrands, that you take from this speech, I want you to remember one thing. Your sacrifice is what allows the acolytes of the Afterlife to barter with the Gods,&quot; General Ullrich says. &quot;We have always had just enough to feed everyone. The Gods satiate us with sustenance for our prayers. And from sacrifice, we have just enough to protect the last bastion of our people against the evil of the Chymaerans. But this is always just barely enough. Just enough, because of the courage of these young cadets, to fight for our dreams of another Golden Age!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;An applause circulates the stadium like cracking ice. We are enclaved by the vast unknown of the lifeless, frozen wasteland: our race fording a frozen river we should have fallen into ages ago. Every year we treat graduation as if it were the last, because all we&apos;ve ever hoped for is just a way to stay alive.</p>
<p>&emsp;The grand auditorium of the Academy is open to the impossibly warm air. The ashen smog is too thin here to obscure our sight and poison our lungs. Many see the sky for the first time in years, migrating up the mountainside to visit their children in this moment of bittersweet celebration.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Twelve thousand students in this graduating class of northern Blackwater. Only two hundred of you will defend the Afterlife as Royal Guards. Five thousand more will defend the lower city. And the rest will fight to defend our frostbitten foothold as soldiers on the front lines, fighting the Chymaera. But I want you to think of the others that never even joined: toiling as power-workers and miners that never see this glorious purpose thorugh. To the fighting Firebrands on the front lines, I want you all to remember: you are the greatest asset our people have.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Ullrich&apos;s eyes fall to the span of seats roughly sixty-percent back, notably dotted with absent chairs. It&apos;s no wonder us cadets are called suicide scholars: either signed on by family that birthed them for the stipend, or by the passionate tales in Seminary motivating them to sign away their life &mdash; as early as they learn how to write the letters of their name.</p>
<p>&emsp;Several cadets far behind us retch into the bags tucked beneath their seats, masked over by the fanfare of instruments stationed directly behind them. Curious, my fingers fumble beneath my seat to find there is nothing there &mdash; but I&apos;m close enough to touch the stage. </p>
<p>&emsp;Ullrich continues, as the orchestra finds the perfect balance, between muting out the cries of panic and allowing Ullrich&apos;s words to resound in hallowed glory.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I am infinitely proud of every single one of you. We will always be at war with the Chymaera. But it&apos;s&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All a lie!&quot; one of the lower Cadets yells. There are several in the aisle creeping towards the stage. But the Royal Guard are quick to put them down and drag them away. Uncertainty is an illness that slowly metastasizes in the soul. All they know is that one returns for every fifteen they send into the meat grinder. They even dig the graves before they leave, to pretend there is something there beneath. </p>
<p>&emsp;At least suicide leaves something. If they die, not even a single piece of them will return to attest to their life.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;It&apos;s a fight worth having,&quot; Ullrich says. The orchestra has to improvise to keep the lost time. &quot;We are the last survivors of this frozen world where none of us ever asked to be born. But we are here. And you . . . we, owe it to each other, to defend the sanctity of this chance at life. To give everything. To lose yourselves in the beauty of this divine sacrifice ever since the fall of our people. To pay the debt they left behind. To have a chance to return to that golden age!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The choir crescendos with their chorus. Ullrich raises his hands as the unsetting sun penetrates the clouds of smog. Rays of light reach the Afterlife first before the leftovers illuminate our pallid faces, and the Royal Guards applaud and cheer, followed by the cheers of the crowd, booming like the songs of worship we sing to the Afterlife&apos;s central peaks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And to provide the last words of this benediction is a cadet that needs no introduction,&quot; Ullrich says. I feel Romin&apos;s massive hand grasp my left shoulder with pride, muttering either one of his jokes or words of encouragement. Sylvia grasps my right hand before she nervously withdraws. And Valentina peeks her head over Sylvia&apos;s shoulder, expecting me to smile with some strong sense of pride for what it&apos;s taken me to get here.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not only did his quartet of Fireteammates place in the top three combat scores of their class, but he obtained a one-hundred-and-five percent score on his exit exams. He scores higher than the East, South, and West Academies. And yet I&apos;m told he still finds enough time to care for his sister, and to work alongside his father. He is the pride of our people, and everything that any Cadet should aspire to.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The left and right sections of underclassmen turn to me. I feel the intensity of all the eyes in the auditorium, but I can&apos;t hear the words of encouragement; feel the strangers patting my back and asking me how I pulled it off. It&apos;s not nervousness that muffles their voices, mutes their touch, or softens their glances of misplaced admiration. I&apos;m not afraid of that unpracticed string of words I&apos;ll share, because I know how exactly how to deceive them into thinking they&apos;re special like Ullrich does.</p>
<p>&emsp;I reach to shake Ullirch&apos;s hand as he smiles. </p>
<p>&emsp;The applause is deafening and insincere. Ullrich extends his hand as I climb the stairs, timed so perfectly to the music like all his appearances: like one of Valentina&apos;s famous moving pictures, or composed like one of Sylvia&apos;s commissioned paintings.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ve got such a brilliant future ahead of you, son,&quot; he says, speaking as if I were one of his own, but then the sudden onset of a splitting headache nearly casts me down.</p>
<p>&emsp;The world goes dark, as if I stand in a cave. </p>
<p>&emsp;The ground trembles beneath me. </p>
<p>&emsp;I can taste the iron as it condenses on my tongue, vanishing from palate it slides down my throat. I can smell that horrid smell of burning rubber, ozone, and rotten flesh of a million dead liquidated faster than they could react. I remember the feelings I had never felt before: of a true steadfast resilience, of burning resentment, and the fading faces of cherished friends and family I swore I&apos;d never forget. I&apos;m so angry when I can&apos;t remember the names of people I&apos;ve never met, while the voice pleads for me to resign this life and let them take over. A string of three sentences.</p>
<p>&emsp;Open up.</p>
<p>&emsp;Let go.</p>
<p>&emsp;Never alone.</p>
<p>&emsp;But the presence is too weak.</p>
<p>&emsp;The command of that phantasmal projectionist fades, and though he pleads in my mind with words that sound like my own, his words fade to irreconcilable fragments of meaningless words, before it disappears altogether.</p>
<p>&emsp;Ullrich stabilizes me with a familiar touch.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Are you alright?&quot; He asks. &quot;What happened this time?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;But my mind is still sharp.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Think I overestimated how much to drink to get me through this speech.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;He laughs, clapping me gently on the back.</p>
<p>&emsp;I grasp my head as I approach the podium with a brilliant smile. I refuse to cast my eyes to the vacancy unfilled by my adopted father and sister. And it&apos;s when I rest my hands on the podium that I realize I feel nothing; absolutely nothing at all. </p>
<p>&emsp;I was foolish to think this moment would feel any different than all the others.</p>
The throbbing in the birthmark on my wrist is the last discomfort to subside. All that&apos;s left is the eternal chill of Blackwater, the last frostbitten city of the Humans. And after I pause long enough for effect, waiting a little longer . . . and a little longer . . . I open my mouth to speak the first string of uninspired words, telling them exactly what they want to hear."},{"DocType":"Act","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":"","AutoNameFull":"ACT II","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":"","ChapterFull":"","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":5,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"4","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"Act One","Body":""},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Snowdrifter","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;One","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Two","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":1,"ChapterFull":2,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":6,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"4","Synopsis":"Titus and his friend Romin explore the outer wastes of Blackwater.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.2","Links":{"Wattpad":"https://www.wattpad.com/user/SavantGuarde","Personal":"https://autononymous.io/authors-and-stories/savantguarde/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand/firebrand-1-01","RoyalRoad":"https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/2142187","AO3":"https://archiveofourown.org/works/63835228/chapters/163696444","DeviantArt":"https://www.deviantart.com/savant-guarde/art/Firebrand-01-Snowdrifter-1172922345"},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

<p>&emsp;The skyline burns in the light of an everlasting sun. Blistering winds raise the virgin snow into clouds of shimmering flakes, blending the distant foilage of the tundra into the ancient sheets of frost. Dry snowbanks of frigid, grating ice stretch further than my eyes can focus, cracking like dead leaves in the wake of my footfalls. </p>
<p>&emsp;I am a Snowdrifter, and this is my last adventure: tethering the line of danger and death in pursuit of artifacts from a long-past age. Only the poor dare to venture beyond the walls of the the last city, seeking treasures and wares to sell to others who have the money to collect them. But for this last trip, I&apos;m not alone. </p>
<p>&emsp;We unwrap the scarves from our faces when the smoke no longer saturates our lungs, trading breath behind fabric for the freshness of the biting cold. Furs cover every surface of our flesh with at least an inch of insulation, trapping snowflakes between strands of fur like flies to honeyed paper. </p>
<p>&emsp;Somewhere hours behind us, the last city of Blackwater awakens. Streetlamps of lighttime set civilians on their schedule in the absence of a setting sun. Turbines churn power into the veins of the Humans&apos; last city, pumping life and heat into a dying, frostbitten husk: a heat we don&apos;t have his far beyond the walls.</p>
<p>&emsp;But there&apos;s a different way to keep warm, even if it stings.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin takes swigs from the bottle to warm his insides, casting me in the shadow of his stature. His dark skin sweats from internal heat as he carries the weight of all his corded muscle. The warmth of liquor gives us enough breath to speak, despite how the frigid air burns our lungs. And he does enough speaking for the two of us, passing time in chaff by listing as many as he can remember.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot; . . . And then the one girl I snuck off with after the end of Seminary. Then that one broad from down the hall, you know, when we moved into the Lofts: the one that said she worked with livestock. I&apos;m not sure what she did with the animals, but she changed my whole view of what a woman can do.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;My lungs burn on a laugh as he takes a deep swig, using the bottle to punctuate his sentences. </p>
<p>&emsp;He says, &quot;I think that woman ruined my sense of taste!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, really?&quot; I ask. &quot;Becuase you think you can do any better?&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;Half the time I think he&apos;s off on a bit, but this time, it&apos;s too hard to tell. Romin spent the last hour recounting the names of all his sexual partners. The hour before, he recounted his plans for life after service in the Royal Guard, and how he plans to spend all his money. And now that the booze blocks his memory, he uses the next hour to badger me again with the same stupid question.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I invited myself to come because I was afraid you weren&apos;t planning on coming back. Gods above, the years you spent getting to this point . . . and when they want to throw a lavish party in your honor, you turn them down for this?&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;He gestures at the barren landscape. Trapped in an open room of white flakes, there&apos;s nothing to see except the silhouettes of trees, the sky above us, and maybe rogue bands of Chymaerans, concealing their slender limbs in the branches. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods above, Titus! You&apos;re the Valedictorian of all the Academies,&quot; Romin says. &quot;You should be using it to get everything you can. It&apos;s the anxiety of what comes next that makes all the sex so much better.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t do it for recognition,&quot; I tell him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then for what? You&apos;re not weak like the lower ranks. You&apos;ve made it,&quot; he insists. &quot;We made it. Our whole Fireteam did. Did you know that eight percent of graduates this year iced themselves?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. And I saw the empty seats from the stage at graduation.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course, our Fireteam is good enough to defend the city: top one percent. But if you were with those losers, wouldn&apos;t it be better to die beyond the walls? Taking the fight to the Chymaera, rather than falling on your own blade?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re not losers. It&apos;s not their fault: most are coerced into it, even bred for it. Some send their sons and daughters to the Academy with apathy for what comes after. They crank out kids like rabbits for the welfare &mdash; train them high enough to get into an upper class, and you&apos;re relieved of poverty for as long as they can study.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you were adopted,&quot; Romin says. &quot;And your father wastes his own money, not yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, he wastes my money, too,&quot; I say. &quot;He gets most of the check.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;But you don&apos;t have the ties of blood like us, so why did you even bother? What made you fight?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A feeling,&quot; I tell him. </p>
<p>&emsp;A feeling I&apos;ve had since as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A feeling?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What kind of feeling?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I tell him, because I don&apos;t have the words. Somewhere between desperate longing and crippling anxiety. It&apos;s been so long that I can only remember the experiences that shaped it. </p>
<p>&emsp;So many years ago in that orphanage with Sylvia, it came from a dream I had. When  I was watching all the other kids get adopted. When I had a bedroom window facing the impassable gates. All I ever wanted was to be good enough for a mom and dad &mdash; knowing if I turned eighteen, they&apos;d pitch me on the side of the road and I&apos;d end up like the homeless outwallers. Maybe it&apos;s been raising my sister after my father gave up. Or maybe it was just a spark based off some childish thought &mdash; like revenge against fate, or some innocent dream of grandeur.</p>
<p>&emsp;He offers his bottle to usher me further, and after a sip, I try again.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All I&apos;ve ever thought of in this life is what I still have to do, and the people I have to do it for.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. Because winning just happens &mdash; not from all those nights you turned down our adventures for studying. I know they blend together, but . . . can&apos;t you remember any of it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course!&quot; There&apos;s too many to count. &quot;The time we explored the pitch-dark drainage tunnels in first year? When you led us from the front, screaming that you saw something? And we ran? How Valentina tore and dirtied up her dress so bad we had to cover her with your coat, or else she&apos;d be parading the halls in her underwear?&quot; I expose the flesh on my left arm. A small staccato of scars spans the space above the birthmark on my wrist. &quot;I sure remember how infected this got.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He laughs. &quot;Oh, and the . . . and the time after that when Sylvia drank for the first time?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I remember how close she got to me when we were in the hallway alone. My heart was pounding. She hunched over so far we were at eye level. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I still have that picture she drew &mdash; I framed it on the wall because she hides it every time I leave it out. You think I could sell it to some rich Merlotan family twenty years from now?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The thought makes him laugh. The cold makes him cough and stumble. &quot;Gods above. The darling artist whose Academy posters are all over Blackwater. How would those filthy-rich Merlotan pigs try to brag about it on the wall over cheese and crackers?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I imagine Valentina&apos;s family &mdash; expensive drink in one hand, the other gesturing to the marble plaque below the framed napkin on the wall. Oh, I can see it . . . that pretentious cursive serif they use, etched black. With two words.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I let the image stew for a while. Romin takes a swig of the moonshine his Carmine brotherhood makes, and I only speak when the bottle is upsidedown in my mouth.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin spits. It almost shoots out his nose before he can regain himself. He drops the lead of his sled and almost disappears into the virgin snow before he finds his breath again, laughing hysterically. &quot;That&apos;s not what I saw at all. But you&apos;re right! Gods above &mdash; I must have had it upside-down.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Isn&apos;t that how all art works?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I guess. Unless it has letters on it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He chuckles a couple times before finding his composure. I ruffle my jet-black beard. &quot;See, I didn&apos;t forget the stuff that matters.  I just remember . . . how you guys made me feel, you know, despite how distant I was. Like I was always welcome to return when I was ready.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, it&apos;s over now. You never &apos;got&apos; ready. And now we&apos;re out past the walls, telling jokes on the edge of death. You gave up a fully-funded Academy celebration to trudge around outside the walls and act poor. We&apos;ve made it, Titus! Maybe we&apos;ll never be as rich as Valentina, but you don&apos;t need to do this anymore. To trudge through snow for several days? Dragging back ancient knick-knacks and forbidden books? So that rich Merlotans can buy them from your father&apos;s eternal rummage sale, and plant them on their mantle as a talking piece?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not about that,&quot; I insist. &quot;Not this time. I&apos;m not going to be down in the lower city anymore, so Ellie and Clint will have to manage on their own. It&apos;s about something else. This map&mdash;&quot; but he ignores me, with that lofty look that sticks in his eyes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I thought I had power this close to the top, but you&apos;re on a whole other level. You could have done anything! Hold a party on the Academy&apos;s money, plaster your name and face on everything, and you could take any broad home you want. And if you played it right, maybe two or three, if they were some of those cadets below second rank looking to pop their cherry, before they&apos;re sent off to get iced by the Chymaera.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d take adventure over all that social posturing any day,&quot; I say. &quot;You think it would ever end up about me? I&apos;m not about that. And talking to leadership is like watching old people eat. No &mdash; it is watching old people eat. That&apos;s the only reason any instructors or cadets would show up: to load their plates first, and act like they&apos;re there for me second.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, I get it,&quot; Romin says. &quot;If you want someone to blow your horn all night, you&apos;d rather have your lady do it in private.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, screw off,&quot; I tell him. Usually he cracks a smile trying to get a rise out of me, but is as if there&apos;s some truth he found snared in it.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All that time you spend in the Academy lofts, doing whatever it is you do, we hardly see you. Gods above, you should&apos;ve heard what Sylvia said the other night. Val and I coaxed her out and bought her some drinks.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What did she say?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why should I tell you?&quot; he says &quot;You weren&apos;t there to hear it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My eyes return to the ground. I built walls around a tightness in my chest, and for a second, I catch myself thinking he understands.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin says, &quot;I get why you&apos;re upset. We&apos;re all going through change. All those cadets and their foursome Fireteams might never talk again. It&apos;s so hard to believe that, especially after every group has been together this long.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re right. It&apos;s just been hard,&quot; I say, because lying is easy. I&apos;ve practiced so many times on my younger sister Ellie that it&apos;s second nature. &quot;It&apos;s just the guilt of all those cadets that aren&apos;t going to make it,&quot; I come up with.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s not your fault.&quot; He places his hand on my shoulder. &quot;If leading the Carmine has taught me anything, it&apos;s that people are addicted to a free ride, and none want to pay the ticket when it&apos;s due.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The civvies call us suicide scholars for a reason. The money is tempting. And yet, regardless of all that empty land near the outer walls, they never seem to run out of space.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;But it&apos;s not your fault,&quot; Romin repeats. &quot;You don&apos;t get to feel guilty for succeeding when we were only born into this system. We earned this. We signed up for this just like they did. You can&apos;t achieve anything without stepping on someone else, so you might as well do it with force.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But some of them were born just for the stipend,&quot; I say. &quot;And others are adopted, like me, for that same reason.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, come on. Your mother and father loved you!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Moira loved me,&quot; I say. &quot;And ever since that night, I&apos;ve done it all alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ve all been alone. Wading through so much shit we lost all sense of smell. But there&apos;s something more, waiting after all of that. Can&apos;t you feel it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;That bottomless pit in my stomach. </p>
<p>&emsp;The guilt of inaction. </p>
<p>&emsp;The fear of every possibility forking everywhere at the same time, and always wondering if I lost the true path some0time long ago.</p>
<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;Maybe I&apos;ve always felt it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;This is a new beginning, Titus. Leaders do nothing compared to the weaker ones below them. We&apos;ll be serving the acolytes of the Gods whose prayer feeds our entire city. Above the clouds where Essence will keep us warm. And we&apos;ll be doing nothing &mdash; who fights the chosen ones in the central peaks of the Afterlife? Who bites the hand that feeds them? And after service, we&apos;ll settle down. You and Sylvia, and me and Valentina &mdash; unless I hit it off with some divine broad up there.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;d do that?&quot; I ask. &quot;You&apos;d betray us so easily?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Never. You&apos;re my best friend. I&apos;d never leave you behind.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s what I thought.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;...Unless you got in my way,&quot; he says.</p>

<p>&emsp;Romin runs his mouth further, his words stoking our conversation like a fire on its last log. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, but seriously. Sylvia might be tall and thick, but Valentina&apos;s that perfect kind of short, you know? Like, thick-short. but the good kind of thick, and the good kind of short. Like trees versus shrubs, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I laugh. &quot;I don&apos;t know, Romin.&quot; He passes a sip from his bottle of cinnamon whisky to give a nice warmth without heat. The liquor stings my throat as his two neurons debate what he&apos;s going to say next. He&apos;s pretty good in school, yet I wonder if the only functioning parts of his intoxicated brain are women and combat.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Valentina&apos;s got that feminine charm, too. It&apos;s why she&apos;s so popular. It&apos;s why she&apos;s been an actress in all the Academy flicks &mdash; hic &mdash; and why she&apos;s so famous,&quot; he says. &quot;To be a daughter of the Merlot &mdash; with all that wealth and power &mdash; that persona is what makes you feel so high and unreachable to everyone else. That&apos;s the true definition of power. And she can help me get there, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s eyes glass over like marbles with a familiar glance. It&apos;s the same gaze when he looks upon the statue of his brother, immortalized in bronze, holding the sword that supposedly impaled him when he was serving out beyond the walls fighting the Chymaera. I&apos;m not surprised when he brings him up again.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Funny how the anniversary of Ryder&apos;s sacrifice comes around at the same time that we graduate. It&apos;s too bad he can&apos;t see how the Carmine of our district celebrate him,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s the only thing that sucks about dying, with the warrior&apos;s fate that awaits us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not getting to see the people back home carry your name. My statue&apos;s gonna be massive, you know. Bigger than . . . well, very big.&quot; He hesitates.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I hope your statue is looking up, at least,&quot; I tell him. &quot;From how flat your head is after your mother never turned you, I bet the brothers of the Carmine could fry an egg on there if they ever got hungry.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He rubs sweat from his skull. &quot;Not a chance!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I guess it never gets warm enough,&quot; I say.  &quot;Unless your ego was trapped in there. Then brothers could use it as a hand-warmer after a long day&apos;s work!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That statue would melt,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I add, &quot;just from catching rays of light on all that surface. They&apos;ll have to depict you a lot smaller, but you don&apos;t mind, do you? Gods above, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s enough metal in all of Blackwater.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re not calling me fat, are you? It&apos;s muscle,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;re a twig. I bet even Sylvia could crush you if she wasn&apos;t so busy with her soft hobbies all the time...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Taller doesn&apos;t mean stronger,&quot; I say, huffing between breaths. Laughter draws a cough, and the back of my throat stings. It always feels like any meaningful talk between us gets derailed by playful insults. So I bring us back. &quot;But do you like it?&quot; I asked him. &quot;The Carmine, I mean. You were kind of born into it without a choice.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course I do,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m the future of the clan. One day I&apos;ll lead the whole district. How could I not be proud of that?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He beats his chest in pride. All I can think of is the medical report on his desk I stumbled upon days earlier, from his fifth visit to the medics that month. I didn&apos;t know if it was the smoking or the drinking &mdash; but it said he had ulcers, and the heart of someone twice his age.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Enough about me and Val, then,&quot; Romin says, &quot;what about Sylvia? What do you like about her so much?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I liked her before I learned true human nature. In our culture is a nature of apathy towards children who share no familial blood. The value of a family is constituted by the strength of its children, and their service as Cadets in the Academy. The higher their echelon &mdash; the higher their children&apos;s class in the Academy &mdash; the greater the stipend that family receives, so I spent my whole childhood being dissuaded that any kind of love could be unrequited.</p>
<p>&emsp;I was only eight years old when I started training myself, beaten down by kids twice my size, making fun of me for entering Seminary combat school two years early, just because of how badly I longed for a chance to be worthy. All the strongest kids were taken from the orphanage. My room was next to Sylvia&apos;s, and both our windows faced the entry walkway, watching daily as child-after-child was taken to a new home. Those kids achieved something in those fleeting moments we could only ever watch with sickening envy, and all we could do was wonder what was wrong with us. That competitiveness conjured a cruelty among the children that could have cut us deep. That was, not unless we built something stronger; not if one of us was able to protect the other.</p>
<p>&emsp;I learned more about fighting in the orphanage than I did in any combat school. The malice of that toxicity &mdash; not just among the children, but the caregivers who weren&apos;t paid enough to care &mdash; bred it even further. I passed Sylvia words of reassurance when the crimson ring of her iris led her to the name &quot;Blood Eyes.&quot; I fought with my fists and teeth to protect her. If no one was around to keep me safe or show me love, then I would incarnate it. When I watched the reprieve in her eyes when I defended her, I could live through it. I could feel through it, visualizing as if our roles were switched, that intangible, unconditional love I lusted for so strongly, resting in Sylvia&apos;s respite, and I tried to imagine how it felt. I knew it was selfish. All I could accept was that these circumstances had broken me. I could never accept the fa ade of love, hidden behind so many layers of primal, selfish desire, but there was something special with her, that she knew me before that, that she stayed with me all this time for some reason beyond logic. All I know is that it was never love, but something else, something&mdash;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus!&quot; He shoulders me lightly, still enough to nearly send me into a snowbank. &quot;Are you gonna dream about her, or give me an answer?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s nice,&quot; I tell Romin. &quot;And with her medical specialization, she&apos;s really smart about that stuff.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;Even after I was adopted four years later, taken in by a new caretaker that arrived at the orphanage, the pressure to perform still follows me. My adoptive mother Moira always said she fell in love with me. My combat skills were pretty impressive by that point, and my knowledge was three grades ahead, so I guessed I earned it. But it was always that smolder in my mother&apos;s eyes when she watched me that made me uncomfortable: as if she loved me for something else, but I never came to understand. I found that same look in Sylvia&apos;s eyes whenever I talked to her.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because she&apos;s nice?&quot; Romin asks. &quot;Every other day you&apos;re in her room,&quot; he says. &quot;I know you&apos;re not talking. And I don&apos;t need to check her room for dents behind the headboard.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ve never made it that far. Honest,&quot; I say. &quot;We&apos;re close friends: it&apos;d be too uncomfortable.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He stops so I have to turn to meet his eyes through the slit of a face-wrapped scarf. His glare tries to break the tell, but there&apos;s nothing else there.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Honest,&quot; I mumble from beneath the fabric.</p>
<p>&emsp;He continues dragging the sled. &quot;Yeah. Friends, huh,&quot; Romin says. He takes the last swig of his bottle before throwing it aside &mdash; washing that word out as if the scotch were less bitter. &quot;I&apos;m pretty sure you&apos;re more than that.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Silence hangs between us again. Men don&apos;t always have to talk: their minds can race on nothing unless interrupted. Romin is a talkative drunk, but after so many nights out, we always expect to find him snoring in a corner once the liquor runs out. But soon we&apos;ll approach the safehouse that provides our shelter for the night: the station I&apos;ve visited hundreds of times before, the same dot on the map etched in my mind from years of travel. </p>
<p>&emsp;The same brand of anxiety that kept me at the top of my game settles on the fear of this long distance from the walls: not the eerie silence that&apos;s almost become nostalgic, but the fact that this is the farthest I&apos;ve ever gone. It&apos;s a trip that lasts more than a single night, and it almost bothers me more that I&apos;m unafraid.</p>
<p>&emsp;Why do I feel that I am going to die out here? Is that what I want? Am I one of those suicide scholars that takes their own life before the service? My future isn&apos;t beyond the walls. It&apos;s in serving in the lands above. But that crescendo of circles on the map left by my grandfather&mdash;far outside the two-day-trip circle I charted in my own ink&mdash;leads me onward on one final Snowdrifting expedition. All I can hope to find is one thing: what that wordless, regretful terror was that consumed him in the end, when the ability to sleep was stolen from him by the Chymaeran Curse. His hands trembled. His writing accelerated. He mumbled and cried about something he had forgotten. They told us he died in his sleep, but I knew that was a lie. He stayed awake for a full month before he died&mdash;the autopsy says his brain dissolved to a tenth of its size. </p>
<p>&emsp;How could you tell it was the curse? I asked. </p>
<p>&emsp;Because brain matter doesn&apos;t glow purple, they said.</p>

<p>&emsp;The safehouse is the same as I left it. It doesn&apos;t surprise me. Few Snowdrifters would ever dare to travel this far. I can tell, as soon as I find the strategic surplus of spare rations I left months before in the corner, the only reflective thing unsullied by layers of dust&mdash;beyond the drag marks on the table when I swiped a silver candlestick. </p>
<p>&emsp;The building was once a two-bedroom cabin, but there&apos;s only one now. I was ecstatic when I found it a few years back, because it has a stone fireplace. When I rushed through the house to take a survey of the rooms by opening all the doors, I was surprised to find the master bedroom  was remodeled to a snow-covered balcony after the roof collapsed. I sealed off the door two trips ago to keep the heat inside, because no amount of Essence can ever acclimate a house to heat when there&apos;s a broken window or a cracked door.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I think I&apos;ll continue this drunk until we get back,&quot; Romin says. &quot;I saw the rations, did you leave the liquor, too?&quot; He inspects the bottles on the shelf above the roaring fireplace. &quot;I&apos;ve never even heard of this stuff before.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He uncorks the bottle, releasing a long-fermenting odor into the air that makes him gag. He hesitates. A few seconds later, he cautiously draws a sip to his lips, tasting it like he&apos;s one of those refined Vermillions as he swishes the bottle around, aerating the long-aged liquor like a dog lapping water. Satisfied, he shrugs at me, continuing to chug several more gulps of it.</p>
<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;You know, there&apos;s Merlotan royals that would probably pay a hundred Kine just for a shot of that. We&apos;d probably sell it if they ever came down to our shop themselves, instead of sending their servants.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He clutches his chest and grunts. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods above, this must be what that Chymaeran Curse is like. It feels like death, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A lot of things feel like death,&quot; I say. </p>
<p>&emsp;Together, we look out through the tears in the sheet that insulates the window. The sun dips below the horizon, casting shadows across all the landscape. It never gets high enough to brighten the world without help from electric light, but nor does it ever dip low enough for its influence to disappear completely. Though it hides behind the hills, it leaves an eerie glow in the sky, illuminating the two moons in pale green and ruddy orange.</p>
<p>&emsp;Soon the world beyond the glass dissolves to colorless shadows, like sleep, as a yawn escapes me. The fireplace keeps our ears from ringing with the gentle cracks and pops from the logs, catalyzed by Romin&apos;s  hundred-Kine pours and a whole lot of powdery, dead Essence. </p>
<p>&emsp;The Essence casts the fire in bright crimson, making the smoke smell of ozone, and when our eyes adjust to the blackness as much as they can, I can tell what Romin searches for.</p>
<p>&emsp;He stands at the window.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Veins of amethyst in the trees, huh?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s what it says in all the books. Those Chymaeran savages seem to leave everything dead in their wake. &apos;Only a single glow left to show they were ever there.&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Death might be freezing, but I think north of the capital is too cold. Even for them,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No wonder the rail lines ship out east. That&apos;s where they say the front lines are, where they&apos;ll send all the classes below us. That&apos;s where they sent my brother. He was among the top of his class, you know, like you, but he volunteered for it. Can you believe that? He said he wanted a &apos;life of adventure.&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I hope you&apos;re not looking for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, no. I was born with a far more refined taste,&quot; Romin says. &quot;There&apos;s too many things to conquer in this world beyond battles. Women. Work. Strength &mdash; you know, I&apos;m not gonna fit in my coffin when I die,&quot; he says, taking another swig from the bottle that made him gag. He squints his eyes, still trying to make out the amethyst veins. &quot;Say. The Chymaerans,&quot; he asks. &quot;Have you ever seen one of them?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Never,&quot; I say. Romin looks disappointed: all he brought was food, booze and weapons, and I&apos;m pretty sure he hoped to use all three of them. &quot;Just frozen corpses,&quot; I say. &quot;And their veins weren&apos;t purple with the Chymaeran Curse. Their bodies didn&apos;t decay to ash from it, either.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But what did them in?&quot; Romin asks, turning back to the warmth of the fire.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They were greedy with their time, taking too much, and they didn&apos;t head back early,&quot; I say. &quot;First rule is that there&apos;s always another trip.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s hands tremble as he tries to hinge his fingers, reaching closer towards the flames. &quot;What do they look like? Have you seen one? I mean, in a whole decade out here, you had to have seen something, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;d think I would. You&apos;ve heard the descriptions of them, though. Their race is tall, obsidian color, absorbing any brightness . . . like the opposite of light, hard-shelled and solid on the outside.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And they say they take the faces of their victims,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Carmine records say you can&apos;t even recognize the difference. And the longer they take your identity, the better they get at being you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I laugh. &quot;Those are Academy wives&apos; tales. The instructors tell that to scare new cadets.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s written in our history. The Carmine preserve everything the city tries to bury. We preserve all the Humans&apos; past, all that stuff the Merlot and the city try to hide. They&apos;re not a legend. They&apos;re out there, and they&apos;re very real.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;And I believe, too. While the Humans control life and heat, the Chymaera control frost and death, and I have secondhand evidence of their latter strength. It was what I witnessed as the second death of my grandfather. His first death was five years ago, when the Chymaeran Curse overtook him: the amethyst in his veins, the deterioration of his mind to the point that my father Clint wouldn&apos;t let me visit him. He wrote and scribbled for years, driven mad by the passion of a single thought. In my hands was the map he left my father and I, etched with the locations of landmarks beyond the walls. And with graduation, I know this is my last chance to reach the spot that Everett marked with a climax of circles.</p>
<p>&emsp;After several hours of listening to gale, haunting winds between pops of the smoldering logs, exhaustion outpaces our primal fears. And as the fire fades to ash and soot, we fall asleep beneath the blankets we brought on the sleds. My fingers hinge around the necklace my mother left me. Despite the cold, its black, crystalline surface is even colder.</p>
<p>&emsp;Sleep finds us quickly. We find ourselves alive and freezing the next morning: at least not cold enough to become frosthards. The last material Romin wants for his statue is ice, and the last place he wants it is forgotten with another several hundred years of history, forever lost beyond the walls. </p>
<p>&emsp;After I dress myself in the same clothes hardened with sweat from yesterday&apos;s travels, drink fresh water from melted snow, and consume half of the remaining rations I left in the corner, we release the makeshift locks and crack open the front door to blinding white.</p>
<p>&emsp;The lack of footprints sets us in an uncomfortable ease, as if amethyst veins in tree bark or the smell of ozone could sift the air when we least expect it. Romin sweats bullets as if he can use them as ammunition, still wearing a belt of two revolvers he fetched from the Carmine armory, making the dagger in my belt feel archaic. You need them. They&apos;ll get to you faster than you can reload, but if your sword and bow are steady... the instructors always said. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s roll,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Peak daylight will be gone before we know it.&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;The second day is faster when the sleds are lighter. We&apos;re almost there: all we&apos;re doing is stopping by to scavenge whatever Everett&apos;s scratchings left for us. Time passes rapidly when Romin never runs out of things to talk about.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s enough about me,&quot; he says. &quot;What do you want to know about me?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;We meander around Everett&apos;s spot for an hour, until we find a single house nestled between the hills, finding log posts that faintly mark the boundary of the small estate.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Surely this is it,&quot; I say. &quot;There isn&apos;t anything else out here.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why have a fence if nature is your only neighbor?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;We toss the leads of our sleds in the snow, preparing ourselves to enter. After trying the knob, I nod to Romin, built in just the shape to get us inside. He smirks, relishing the rare chance to helpfully break something.</p>
<p>&emsp;The door takes a full shoulder before it gives. The hinges screech from beyond a century of snow-borne rust as chips of pine wood tear from the bottom, leaving the door with jagged, gnashing teeth. It siphons the outside air as if the house has lungs to breathe, exhaling a putrid smell of age.</p>
<p>&emsp;The house&apos;s siding groans as it breathes wind into its lungs, and a single chandelier hangs from the wooden cross-beam like a tonsil. Dormant lanterns circle the chains as crystalline fragments shimmer&mdash;if Valentina was here, it would surely remind her of her lavish estate in the foothills. There are no voices outside the walls like our apartments at the Academy, but even in the silence, Romin and I feel that we are being watched.</p>
<p>&emsp;It feels as if some agent consumes all the light in the house, opposite of how light bulbs and lanterns throw their colors. Romin drags a match against the strip of the matchbox, but the box is wet, and he tries drying it off with his shirt. </p>
<p>&emsp;Impatient, I fumble around. With the ancient curtains still drawn, light struggles to filter through the fabric. But we&apos;re lucky that the horrors of this scene don&apos;t present themselves on their own.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin sputters one in sparks. He curses, and light catches a glint in the floor&mdash;is it wet? Glass? Our ancestors beyond the walls couldn&apos;t make floors out of anything other than wood. In the second breadth of darkness, my leg catches a wetness.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin drags another. It snaps. &quot;Khiras above,&quot; he curses, before taking out another.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t use the whole box, we only just got here,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Hold it sideways,&quot; expecting a whine or a punch in the shoulder. But he&apos;s too focused, an oversized toddler playing with fire.</p>
<p>&emsp;The third one lights, casting flickering shadows on the walls as if we&apos;re huddled in a cave, and neither of us are prepared for the sight. </p>
<p>&emsp;The manifestation of an ancient bloodbath comes into focus, painted across the floors as if the glass of the red paintings had shattered under pressure and spilled their contents. A paralyzing fear seizes me. My mind races. My stomach lurches. And now the putrid smell makes sense, the odor that first hit us when we entered. </p>
<p>&emsp;My eyes glance at the map, as if we found the wrong house. The bass in Romin&apos;s voice echoes, but it lacks emotion. &quot;Gods,&quot; he says. We step into the kitchen, where ancient puddles of crimson once caked the floors, kept wet by some form of moisture that condenses in the room, keeping the smell alive. The bones must have been picked apart by animal scavengers: the meat left clean like a rib roast in the dining halls after a hundred starving cadets.</p>
<p>&emsp;I throw my bag on the counter, scattering journals and notebooks and pages and artifacts&mdash;I brought everything I inherited from my grandfather. Romin passes across the carpet with a lantern. His fingers trace desperate scratches on a locked door, followed by jagged, splintered teeth around the doorknob as if someone had tried to break in, bludgeoned indentations that grew weaker and weaker further down. &quot;Fridging Chymaerans. Must have been trying to break in&mdash;the rest of the family hid in here,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;But there&apos;s no trace of Chymaeran Essence along the corpses&apos; scratches. Sylvia once told me that when Human blood and Chymaeran Essence make contact, it glows purple, then leaves a dry chalk residue. It&apos;s what the Chymaeran curse does to the blood. It&apos;s what killed Everett.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So, it wasn&apos;t a Chymaeran attack,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Then was it animals? Or . . . was it Human? </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why would Humans be out here this far? It doesn&apos;t make sense,&quot; I say. &quot;Four-day trips are unheard of.&quot; I scan Everett&apos;s documents and notebooks, and across all of them is the same insignia, the same set of strokes on the stationery my grandfather spilled his last thoughts on. Same with the map, we had been using this map for years &mdash; all the houses, all the terrain other explorers hadn&apos;t charted, beyond the walls, beyond the eyes&apos; reach of the train tracks, all the creases and folds that had been left to my grandfather&apos;s memories, and all those X&apos;es had been circling around one location, where the desperation of Everett&apos;s brainless scratchings reached a crescendo, as if all his cerebral emotions of some long-passed moment had bled in warning. </p>
<p>&emsp;This map isn&apos;t for treasure. It never was.</p>
<p>&emsp;And then the realization comes to me. I look at the tattered door. &quot;Gods . . . look at the marks,&quot; I say, and then the size of the clawed scratchings make sense. It wasn&apos;t an animal: they were handprints; tiny, bloody handprints; tiny, bloody, child-sized handprints. </p>
<p>&emsp;Romin doesn&apos;t bother trying the handle: he can&apos;t stand the thought as an impressionable mentor for the young Carmine. A hundred years dead or not, his kick bludgeons the door in a shower of splinters, and the rancid odor of death grows stronger. The room was some kind of study. The west-facing window glows in dying light as if the entire room were preserved perfectly in amber. </p>
<p>&emsp;Silence sweeps over us for several minutes as we meander about the scene, until Romin&apos;s voice severs it. Something has been bothering him. &quot;They weren&apos;t protecting themselves,&quot; he says, &quot;it just doesn&apos;t make sense. It had to have been something else.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Un-shattered glass in the study, the windows still intact, all locked in the down position&mdash;you see this door locks from the inside, and it was locked.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;If the windows are intact, they stayed in here. They didn&apos;t try to leave. The coward inside left the children out there! Why did they stay in the room? Against whatever &mdash; or whoever &mdash; was in here, why didn&apos;t they escape out the window?&quot; His fingers feel the window lock: still tight against the panes of glass, and he begins to fervently scan the study. </p>
<p>&emsp;My stomach turns with the setting sun. Anxiety begins to build. If we don&apos;t leave now, we&apos;re not getting out of here tonight. The sickness of that fills my chest with claustrophobic shadow. &quot;I&apos;m not sleeping here tonight. We don&apos;t have lumber or Essence for a fire, it&apos;s all at the storehouse. We&apos;ll freeze if we&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just hold up,&quot; Romin says, as darkness crests the horizon somewhere beyond the window. The dusk feels like a cold, viscous fluid seeping into vacant space. It feels like diving to the furthest bottom of a lake, crossing that threshold where the return is questionable, where breath is a treasured commodity. Never have I been this far out, and the paranoia of all my first fears as a Snowdrifter quickly come back to me. The sky is dark. The spaces between the trees become more indiscernible, and as the black-and-white vision in my eyes slowly takes over, anything and everything looks like an amethyst glow. I thought I had outgrown this amateur&apos;s fear, and for a second I almost think I smell ozone in the air.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;Let&apos;s go, Romin,&quot; I say, &quot;let&apos;s go, let&apos;s get out of here, it&apos;s way too late, and we&apos;re not staying here tonig&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll be fine, Titus,&quot; Romin says, &quot;we can stay here. Look.&quot; He pulls out a pouch with the Carmine crest on it, withdrawing the string, and a faint crimson glow emanates from the bag. &quot;This was only for emergency&mdash;scarce enough as it already is. The Carmine holds a small reserve the city doesn&apos;t know about.&quot; I peek. Inside is even more dead Essence, ten times as combustible as gunpowder, enough to last us a hundred nights or blow the house and everything in eyeshot to the sky.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Fine,&quot; I say, trying to mask the tremor in my voice. Whatever gets us the best haul is all that matters. All I can think of is my sister Ellie, my duty to protect her and raise her, and it terrifies me to think of a world where she lives without me.</p>
<p>&emsp;As Romin stokes the fireplace, all I can think of were the last words I exchanged with Ellie, the bitterness of that last moment. There is no nature to hear beyond the walls of the house; all that meets us is tinnitus. It feels as if we float in nonexistence, in a vacuous sheet of null space lined with trees. It&apos;s as if time doesn&apos;t exist here; a place where news and sound of the industry doesn&apos;t travel; where the smell of sickening smoke doesn&apos;t reach; the only proof of continuity of nature in the migration of the two moons and a blanket of stars above us.</p>

<p>&emsp;The dying fire we lit off of Romin&apos;s Essence crackles like dry leaves, popping and sputtering as it succumbs to the cold. Romin snores in short starts and stops, too patternless to be anything close to white noise, but it doesn&apos;t matter.</p>
<p>&emsp;I won&apos;t sleep tonight, anyways. Once I get over the fear of our distance, surrounded by a scene of carnage without Romin&apos;s witticisms to make me forget, my thoughts bottom out into the guilt I brought with me, riding the residual anguish of our last exchange. I pray to the Gods that one day she&apos;ll understand that I never meant to hurt her; that she&apos;ll see how hard I fight for her, even if I&apos;m not around to explain.</p>

<p>&emsp;It was the morning before we left: the last errand before Romin and I met at my father&apos;s shop.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Look, look,&quot; Ellie said, &quot;Look, did you see? There&apos;s letters on the walls.&quot; She tensioned her frozen fingers between my hands, dragging me from the footpath.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Those are names,&quot; I said. &quot;People put their names there before they leave to protect our city. They etch them in there.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But why?&quot; my sister asked.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re stalling,&quot; I said. &quot;You have to get to school, so let&apos;s&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just tell me!&quot; she shouts, standing still as cardstock. &quot;Just tell me, Tie.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I checked my watch. Every morning was a rush when our father slept at his shop. But I was thankful &mdash; those mornings, the smell of alcohol on his breath was enough to make my sister uncomfortable. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They put them there to be remembered. It&apos;s really dangerous out there, you know. It&apos;s cold. It&apos;s colder than it is along the outer city walls. &quot; She traced her fingers along the indentations of a stone marked CHESTER COLEMAN. The date read a hundred years ago. &quot;This one was one of the first. In fact, it was almost a hundred years ago our city started doing this, after the fall of the capital city.&quot; Snow saturated the sharp contours of the carving, leaving the name nearly lost to time. I looked up to the top of the walls: the furthest boulders so small they appeared like grains of sand, still etched with names as far as I could see, and only several hundred were marked with the triumphant &apos;X&apos; that denoted a cadet&apos;s return. I prayed to the Gods the survivors had just forgotten to mark them. After I passed the Outer Gates, would any eyes ever read my name upon the wall?</p>
<p>&emsp;Ellie caught me lost in thought again &mdash; she is good at it. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s go. We can&apos;t be late like yesterday,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I&apos;m not stalling,&quot; Ellie said, tensioning her grasp further. &quot;I just want to be with you for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know, I know. But I&apos;ll&mdash;&quot; pick you up after? Careful. &quot;I&apos;ll see you in a few days,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;A few days?&quot; she asked. &quot;That&apos;s so long!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I have to go beyond the walls again. Dad needs more goods for the rummage store. More antiques to sell. He&apos;s got buyers lined up, so we need fresh stock.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Boo,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s okay, though. Valentina&apos;s drivers will be here after Seminary to pick you up.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s not! Why doesn&apos;t Daddy pick me up? I haven&apos;t seen him in days,&quot; she said. &quot;He&apos;s worse than Mom, and Mom is still away.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Her words stick like shrapnel. Clint seems to find his only comfort in the portrait behind the counter: the metallic corners worn to fillets from his fingers. His same grasp holds the store as it sifts like sand through his fingers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He won&apos;t be back tonight. But I&apos;ll be back soon. I promise. Then we can do something fun.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But why?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s for our future, and your future. And your education,&quot; I say, but Ellie&apos;s hands balled into fists, straining her skin as her nails bit into her flesh. &quot;I promise. I&apos;m really trying&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not fair!&quot; she says, stamping her feet. &quot;Why can&apos;t you be here? Why does everyone leave me? Why does everyone hate me?&quot; The emptiness in her gaze stretched on with a thousand-yard stare: not into my eyes, but through me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I hoped my warmth would suffice for reason. &quot;I love you, Ellie,&quot; I say. &quot;I love you more than anything. But there&apos;s someone in every family who has to fight for it.&quot; I held the back of her head to my shoulder like our mother once did to me. </p>
<p>&emsp;But she resisted the warmth of my embrace. Her arms dangled in protest. Not seeing her mother or father probably made her wonder if she was ever born at all. And as an adoptee from the orphanage, I knew exactly how that felt.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I love you,&quot; I told her. &quot;I promise I&apos;ll come back soon.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You always do this, Tie.&quot; She twisted from my grasp. &quot;I hate this life here. Daddy says I can live somewhere else, but you won&apos;t let me. I hate you! Why can&apos;t you just let me go?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She disappeared into the Seminary doors before I could call out to her, her tiny hands clasped around the lunch I packed for her. I hoped she read the note I left in there, every day reminding her how much I loved her &mdash; even if it did nothing, it was the persistence that was worth it. All I could think of was how much I wished I could leave more. Or something more permanent &mdash; something that would stay with her. How will she remember me?</p>

<p>&emsp;My mind is restless. I have to keep moving, I have to do something. I can&apos;t sleep on the carpet stained with blood, so I scrounge around. A golden corner protrudes from the bag that Romin strapped around his shoulders, and I pull the item out to satiate my ravenous curiosity.</p>
<p>&emsp;I wrap myself in two blankets before I crack the spine of the book. The darkness makes it difficult to discern the black font from the vellum. I light a candle, primed with a pinch of Romin&apos;s Essence, and it throws crimson light on the walls of the foyer, illuminating the pages.</p>
<p>&emsp;Before I could read, I looked upon Everett&apos;s books in his library in awe of their black-ink artistry&mdash;scribed in forbidden ink. The weathered pages made me wonder their age, and Everett told me they recorded the world before the Fall of Nordhaven, before the moment that the Chymaeran extremists liquidated our capital city, killing the original royal family and forcing us to retreat to the city of Blackwater.</p>
<p>&emsp;This book is so similar. Illustrations of a feline race called the Ahkvas line the pages: drawings of landscapes with plants so tall you can&apos;t see the sky from the ground, and another race of creatures with wings, another like plants, and so many others I can&apos;t distinguish. Fine-gritted rocks stretch over endless landscapes in places so dry they don&apos;t get any water. There are bodies of water filled with salt that stretch so far you can&apos;t see the end of them&mdash;to imagine salt as something so common!</p>
<p>&emsp;But it&apos;s towards the end that the illustrations surprise me. The chapter reads AND NOW, THE GREAT CITY OF BLACKWATER. </p>
<p>&emsp;The illustrations are indiscernible. Luscious landscapes stretch just beyond the city. Vines cascade from the city walls: I recognize them as the center walls, the original bounds of the city before the Fall forced our people to expand. And in the center are the great peaks of The Afterlife: shrouded in clouds, in great mystery to anyone living below them. After all, the only contact to those Acolytes who connect with the Gods are the Merlot, Valentina&apos;s folk; the city&apos;s active government officials who carry out Their commands and distribute Their gifts.</p>
<p>&emsp;At first, I think I see the Chymaerans attacking the Humans in the following pages. But I&apos;m wrong. They&apos;re tending fields together. They&apos;re working in cooperation with the Humans. Captions read THE UNION OF LIFE AND DEATH and BLACKWATER: UNION IN DICHOTOMY.</p>
<p>&emsp;I wish such stories survived to stir the souls of our citizens, not burned en-masse in the great book burnings. The Merlot tell us of the strength in severing ourselves from that past, making ourselves stronger, raising our children to fight and defend the last foothold of the Humans so the Chymaera can&apos;t extinguish our people and our light. They tell us there is no space for fairy tales &mdash; that they distract us from true purpose, from the calling to forge a new golden age for our people.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s snore pulls me back to the present moment. The Essence we lined in all the candles runs low, and I pray the heat will last us the rest of the night. I think of Ellie and Sylvia. I imagine their disheartened faces if I failed to return.</p>
<p>&emsp;My eyes grow heavy as my fingers reach to close the book. It catches itself on the last page of an inscription addressed in ink. To Ullrich, Evella, young Fletcher and Lyra: the next golden age lies in our blood.</p>
<p>&emsp;With love, Everett.</p>

<p>&emsp;Romin awakens to find the house torn apart even further.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I should have known that map wasn&apos;t for treasure,&quot; I say, my skin pallid from a sleepless night without warmth. I breathe between my palms. &quot;Did you read the inscription on the book you found?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, I just liked the pictures,&quot; Romin says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I snort. &quot;You oversized toddler.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;My father and I thought Everett&apos;s map charted the houses and landmarks he found. But this wasn&apos;t any stranger&apos;s house.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because that book you found was inside this house,&quot; I say. &quot;And it was addressed by my grandfather himself.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So?&quot; He asks.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;So this was his house! Or he knew the people here, a long, long time ago. I&apos;ve been looking all morning for more clues. I tore through bookshelf after bookshelf, looking for notes, photographs, anything . . . but it&apos;s almost as if this whole house was already cased. It just feels like things are conveniently missing.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin is smart with this stuff: if being a Snowdrifter is my world, this is entirely his. &quot;I work repossessions with Carmine business. Nobody hides anything from us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Doesn&apos;t everything feel like it&apos;s already been combed through?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin says, &quot;It does. Low-value items laid out&mdash;you see, to hide their things, they&apos;d arrange their house so neatly you&apos;d think they weren&apos;t hiding anything at all. That&apos;s why my suspicion&mdash;&quot; he says, tracing the corner of the wall again until he returns to the office, feeling for frayed carpet fibers and shifting his weight to feel the wooden planks beneath the surface.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s absurd why anybody would hide something valuable in a house like this,&quot; I say. &quot;This far from the walls? Wouldn&apos;t it be better guarded in a castle or a grand estate?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;d be surprised,&quot; he says. &quot;Most houses built before the Fall of Nordhaven, stone ones like this, had hollow floor spaces. And in a room like the office...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The carpet folds backwards in the corner. Beyond our lanterns, first light catches a reflection off the rectangular lid of an aluminum tin.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is that?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;Not sure yet.&quot; Romin&apos;s fingers fondle for an edge until he lifts it from the hollowed crevice. It looks like a munitions box, but a lot heavier: the walls so thick it surely wasn&apos;t stamped out of sheets of steel. </p>
<p>&emsp;After assessing the weight of the thing inside it, he triumphantly hands it to me. &quot;That might be a free month with your sister,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I shake it. Something heavy clangs inside, giving off a curious energy that stands my hairs on end, and I mutter words of disbelief.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Valentina calls my line of work criminal. But I&apos;m glad at least someone can appreciate it,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope it pays back for the night here.&quot; Without the Essence in his bag, there&apos;s no chance we could have made it.</p>
<p>&emsp;The metal box emits an energy stronger than his bag of Essence. We hastily gather our things and leave as soon as we can.</p>

<p>&emsp;No grand welcome awaits us as we enter the walls two days later, early that morning, exhausted. I foolishly wonder if my father or Ellie are worried about me, concerned I made it back a day late. Romin parts for the Carmine compound. I crack open the front door of the shop, unloading belongings, but my father Clint isn&apos;t inside. He knows our protocol &mdash; is he contacting the emergency patrol? Is he putting in a notice about my disappearance, or worse, did he go looking for me? I let the thoughts flood my mind before I remember what I&apos;ve always been to him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, Titus,&quot; Clint says. &quot;Took you damn long enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;He motions to come in from the cold, more interested in the haul than anything else. The temperature climbs a near thirty degrees compared to the freezing conditions outside. Sweat soaks the front of his thin, white shirt in an upside-down triangle, where dirt from his face wiped across the fabric, and it almost feels like an Academy gym from all the humidity.</p>
<p>&emsp;The smell of stuffiness makes me wonder which habit of his caused it&mdash;depends on whether the back door is locked or unlocked. But the bruise on his neck makes me hope I&apos;m not getting another sibling.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So what&apos;dya find out there?&quot; he asks, wiping the sweat from his forehead, tussling his jet-black beard. He hasn&apos;t bathed in a couple days. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Were you concerned? At all?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&emsp;He looks puzzled. &quot;It&apos;s only been two days since you left, hasn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Four. It&apos;s been four days,&quot; I say, &quot;four days I was out there, and Romin and I didn&apos;t even know if we were going to make it back.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;We share a moment of silence before he says, &quot;Oh.&quot; Not an apology, and he&apos;s not impressed, either, just a mumble before he makes his way to the sled, sorting through the trinkets. In that time, my anger builds like the bottom of an hourglass filling with saltpeter, and I know whatever he does next will set me off.</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint spreads the items on the wooden shop floor: old metal signs; porcelain furnishings wrapped in blankets; the highest-value items I&apos;ve learned through years of being a Snowdrifter.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not a bad haul. But not great, either,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;Stunned, although I should have known better, I respond, &quot;Not great! Not great?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He shrugs.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;After the lengths I went to?&quot; I add. &quot;Do you even understand?&quot; It takes all my restraint not to bash in that salt-and-pepper scarred face of his, but I hold myself back. I feel the desire to set him off, just as he frustrated me&mdash;as if it were a game of points. &quot;Ellie. Did you see her at all while I was gone?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m trying to focus, son. Not now,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Your daughter?&quot; The words slip out. &quot;Has she seen you even once this week? This month?&quot; And I can feel his anger build, too.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No. No I haven&apos;t. I&apos;ve been busy,&quot; he says, and I can hear his words crumble like the weak man that he is.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Too busy to care for her.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, that busy,&quot; Clint says, &quot;trying to keep this family afloat.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And you call this a family,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And you call your writing flowery essays at the Academy hard. You don&apos;t know the first thing about real work.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And it&apos;s not like you know the first thing about letting go.&quot; The next words slip out. &quot;Of this shithole and moving on. Try thinking about someone other than yourself or your dead wife for once!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;They&apos;re the same words he&apos;s heard before. When you argue with someone for so long, when confrontation becomes a part of your daily routine, uncrossable boundaries dissolve and there&apos;s no tape left. When the message doesn&apos;t get across, you go further, and further, until no holds are barred, and irreversible damage singes the bridges that hold together any love you might have felt. There was a day I looked at him and realized he wasn&apos;t my father anymore, just a shell of a man that once carried me on his shoulders, loved his daughter, and kissed his wife. </p>
<p>&emsp;He&apos;s not that man anymore. And he hasn&apos;t been for a long time.</p>
<p>&emsp;He drops the granite statuettes Romin found on the dining room table. They snap, and he snaps, balling his fists in tensioned knots as if emotion can replace logic. &quot;My dead wife. Your mother, you piece of shit,&quot; he says. &quot;You don&apos;t know the first thing about being in love, you pathetic virgin. Too much of a coward to let in anyone like I loved Moira!&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s disgusting how people use your own sensitive disclosures against you. I feel my soul tighten further in my chest, walls of ice freezing further as my feelings of sadness transmute into unbridled rage.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;And the worst thing is&mdash;you&apos;ll never know how it feels.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And that&apos;s the sacrifice I have to make,&quot; I tell him. &quot;to raise Ellie, your daughter, as a better caretaker than your despair would ever allow you. It&apos;s called sacrifice, and you should&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He takes a swing at me. If it were ten years earlier, and we were ten years younger, he&apos;d have the strength on me to knock me down. His frail arms atrophy from years without exercise; depression and unsettled anger consuming much of his appetite. All he does is suck out of the bottle. Years later, and all it does is suck out of him. </p>
<p>&emsp;A second swing surprises me. He hits me square in the chest, but I hardly lose two steps. I have so much anger for him, but the frailer and older he gets, I find my fists can never tension as hard as they should.</p>
<p>&emsp;Combat school made me reflexive, though, and I fight the instinct to drive a fist in his face. So I punch him in the chest, driving him backwards, not enough to hurt him, but just to leave a bruise. He falls on his back. Two store shelves topple over, their contents scattered across the floor: random Snowdrifter finds and pawned items we&apos;ve accumulated over a near decade. Only a single punch and he&apos;s unable to lift himself.</p>
<p>&emsp;I come to realize the disappointment that really triggered this. As he bows his head, gasping for breath, I approach him, using everything I have inside me to lower my voice.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I just . . . I just wanted you to be there, Dad,&quot; I tell him. I extend a hand, but he refuses. His knees crack as he lifts himself up. I bend down to pick up the pieces, but he stops me.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s handle this another time, son,&quot; he says. &quot;I just, I don&apos;t know, just . . . sometimes the thoughts are so loud I can&apos;t . . .&quot; he trails off. It&apos;s his &apos;I&apos;m sorry&apos;, I guess.</p>
<p>&emsp;The sleds rest in the corner, still full of items, and we won&apos;t be getting to them tonight&mdash;because we both need time to cool off. My fingers trace my jet-black beard and dry lips in idle action, uncertain what words to respond with.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And the papers&mdash;&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint. Don&apos;t,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just hear me out, Titus,&quot; he responds, serious enough to use my name. &quot;Nether of us can take care of her the way she deserves. You&apos;re right that I can&apos;t. But you have to realize that you can&apos;t either.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;A rare sight of guilt crests his eyes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I have the Academy stipend. She can live in the house we grew up in. I fought so hard for this. And I&apos;ll give whatever it takes to provide her with that,&quot; I say, &quot;even if it means everything I have.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But all we can give her is just the afterimage. Those days are over. Forever,&quot; he says, but I refuse to believe that.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She just can&apos;t see the full picture yet,&quot; I say. &quot;She&apos;s just too young. If she could only know how much I &mdash;&quot; and then I pause &mdash; &quot;how much &apos;we&apos; give for her . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;But Clint insists. &quot;Let the papers go through. She needs a family that can love her. She needs a full family.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All she needs is me,&quot; I tell him. &quot;She needs us. I might not be her blood, but I can love her. The way that Mom loved me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He hesitates. The words catch in the back of his throat before he finds a way to let them out. &quot;Just do it. For her,&quot; Clint says, and his words trail off. It&apos;s the sound of an impasse, and I know he&apos;ll never accept the value of my efforts.And if he doesn&apos;t have time to appreciate my achievements, to celebrate my efforts, I don&apos;t have a time for another day of us sorting through shit and arguing. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s just get this over with,&quot; I say. &quot;We won&apos;t want to be here any more tomorrow or the next day.&quot; I&apos;d rather be spending this last break with family like everybody else, I think, before I realize where I am, who I am, and who I&apos;m talking to.</p>

<p>&emsp;Two-and-a-half hours pass before we make it to the end. Clint&apos;s not too impressed &mdash; mostly the same stuff that&apos;s been rotting on the shelves for years, but there truly wasn&apos;t anything else out there. Forbidden literature&apos;s much harder to sell than it was a year ago, and after so many close calls with undercover customers from the Ministry Of Truth, we stopped selling them altogether.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s this?&quot; Clint asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Some kind of necklace,&quot; I say, &quot;has some strange glow to it.&quot; If it&apos;s Essenced, it will be much harder to sell &mdash; items channeling Essence are forbidden by law. But they also fetch a significantly higher price.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; he mutters. He draws his glasses from his pocket, peering through the single frame that still holds a lens. &quot;It&apos;s Carmine in origin.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin&apos;s folk,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;He squints his eyes as he tries to discern the etchings. &quot;They wear necklaces just like this, get &apos;em when they cross initiation. Everett was one of them. Probably a million of these around the capital, worn by most all their members, though it&apos;s strange to find one like this &mdash; this must have been a really old one. Where did you find it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;At the spot. Everett&apos;s spot,&quot; I say. His expression shifts with a curious energy, putting an end of his glasses between his front teeth.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You finally made it there,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought we&apos;d never find out what was in there. You could have told me to start.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I did tell you!&quot; I say. &quot;Before I left, Clint.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Whatever,&quot; he grunts. &quot;Just give me the box. It&apos;s the only good find out of this whole bunch.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I hold it a bit longer just to piss him off.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus. Now,&quot; he says, ripping the box from my hands. A jagged metal edge catches my hand, splitting the skin in a fine cut.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ah&mdash;Gods, Clint, can you be any more patient?&quot; I say. A line of crimson appears on my finger, staining the jagged, pearlescent metal.</p>
<p>&emsp;He curses the names of the Gods as if he&apos;s the one hurt. &quot;Khiras and Evella, your idiot friend couldn&apos;t wait to open it &apos;till we brought it here. It&apos;s not my fault. Was he bashed in the head too many times during training?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, he&apos;s not an idiot,&quot; I say, &quot;you just have to be careful.&quot; I draw my hand into the box, curious to hold what&apos;s inside.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Like hell I do, son, if you could just control your stupid friends and&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, piss off,&quot; I say, watching a drip of my blood travel down the necklace. &quot;At least I can control Ellie. My sister. Your daughter. Remember?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, do you remember who makes the money around here? Does you swingin&apos; a sword around at the Academy make things best for us?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I make more money than you do. I bring the stuff that you sell. And at least it makes our family something: something better than a father who can&apos;t get rid of his wife&apos;s shop. For the best. For us. For Ellie.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You son of a bitch,&quot; he spits.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She wasn&apos;t a bitch,&quot; I say. &quot;You treat her memory like she was.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I oughtta&mdash;&quot; Clint says, but then my blood drips down the silver strands and absorbs itself in the center pendant. A sudden flash blinds our eyes: the brightest red leaving a neon in our retinas, and I hear the half-log benches collapse against the ground as we both fall backwards. An aisle of goods crashes to the floor when Clint bashes his head against it. A bright beam of crimson floods from the necklace like a pillar of fire, crashing against the pointed ceiling like a reverse waterfall, filling its volume in an inverted lake of Essenced plasma, and I can hardly see its glowing miasma since both of my eyes are blinded.</p>
<p>&emsp;It feels as if some agent tries to flood my circuits completely. But in its place, an excruciating sensation burns my right wrist, right where my threaded scar is. </p>
<p>&emsp;The glow radiates out the windows.I shield my eyes as a sudden surge of energy saturates my circuits. I roll across the floor to take refuge behind an aisle of dried goods.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Dad!&quot; I shout. &quot;Dad, are you okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Son,&quot; he says, &quot;Son, are you alright?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I crawl towards his voice. The luminous glow tapers away, and eventually I feel the collar of his shirt.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Da&mdash;Clint,&quot; I say, &quot;your head.&quot; He&apos;s bleeding from another slice across his forehead. I lift him from the ground though my eyes can&apos;t yet adjust to the darkness&mdash;he must have clipped the edge of the metal shelves.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s alright, son, I&apos;ve got bandages in the back,&quot; he says. &quot;Where&apos;s that girlfriend of yours with the medical know-how? Sylvia?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not the time,&quot; I say. &quot;How hard did you hit, er&mdash; what day is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Like I&apos;d know that,&quot; he says. &quot;A workday. Just like yesterday. The day before that, the day before that&mdash;&quot; he points to the calendar on the wall, at least twelve days behind on tearing off the dates.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s my name?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re my son, how&apos;d I forget that, you loon,&quot; he says, &quot;I named you. Titus Nathaniel Berguard. Couldn&apos;t have come up with anything better.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And where do you live?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;At our house, just down the street.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You haven&apos;t been there in months,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I guess I live here then,&quot; he says, with a dry, heaving cough to follow. &quot;You gonna lift me up?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I won&apos;t be living here for long,&quot; Clint says. &quot;Your grandfather left us that warehouse of his. We sell that place, we&apos;ll be able to keep this shop open forever.&quot; But he says that every time. It was just a &apos;month or so&apos; a year ago. And it was just a &apos;year or so&apos; two years ago. There&apos;s an emptiness in his eyes when he looks at the picture of Moira on the wall. And how else can I tell his &quot;habits&quot; from earlier? Because I always find a sheet covering the portrait when he&apos;s in the back-room with a &apos;client&apos; that&apos;s looking to &apos;sample the high-value merchandise,&apos; as if her eyes silently judge him from behind the frame.</p>
<p>&emsp;I try for a certain sincerity, but my voice wavers. &quot;Dad, we can&apos;t keep doing this. Please. We have to move on,&quot; I say. </p>
<p>&emsp;He&apos;s heard my reply countless times before, and I&apos;ve heard his response that many times, too, so instead, he ducks his head. &quot;You know, Tie, your mother...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Opened this shop with you, I know,&quot; then I add, &quot;Dad. But she wants us to succeed and move on. To do whatever it takes for her children and husband to thrive.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She wouldn&apos;t want us to sell this place,&quot; he says. &quot;I know I don&apos;t want to, son. You know I was gonna pass this down to you, and you&apos;d run this business hard, and hustle, after your service with the Academy and you survive, and we&apos;ll run this shop together, you and me, and Ellie can help us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just trying to do my best,&quot; I say. My glance dips towards my feet, toes tracing the hardwood floors I crawled on as a child. I find it hard to meet his eyes, and I can tell he has a hard time meeting mine, too. The shop groans from years of eternal winter: the only sound that fills the distance between us. That, and my heart racing at the realization of what the Essenced burst might mean. I can only imagine the punishment that awaits us if Merlot sympathizers, or the city guard, had seen it.</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint says, &quot;So why don&apos;t you go check on Elizabeth at our . . . er, the house, and&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But the Essence! Someone had to have seen that. The city guards, do you know what they&apos;ll do to us? You know what happens to the heretics&mdash;those people who use Essence for anything else.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re fine, Titus,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll be hanged, or thrown in prison on a twenty-year sentence. Or worse, we&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Quit being a pussy and take care of your sister, Titus,&quot; Clint says. &quot;We&apos;ll be fine. Nobody saw it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;And our conversation ends like that. No question of how I am, of the adventure I went on, if I survived, if the mortal coil is still in my body. I&apos;m a convenient tool to him as his son. And the only thing that connects me to him is that he legally receives the stipend from my work in the Academy. If he drops this pathetic shop, we&apos;ll have a chance at something &mdash; anything &mdash; else, but he&apos;s too stubborn and resilient to see a sunken cost when it&apos;s in front of him.</p>

<p>&emsp;The sanctuary bells sound the transition to Darktime when I reach the porch of my childhood home. Pedestrians stop in the streets. My neighbors step out of their homes, ushering their children outside as Ellie exits the front door.</p>
<p>&emsp;Despite the resentment still branded on her face, she succumbs to a longing that leans her into me. Her shoulder presses against my waist, and I wrap my arm around her, giving her a side-hug before we raise our hands and voices for the Rite Of Benediction.</p>
<p>&emsp;It takes mere seconds before disparate voices attenuate to the words of a single body: omnipresent like the eyes of the Gods that watch their severed children.</p>
<p><span class=TitusHand>Bright is the light of the Acolytes&apos; passion</span></p>
<p><span class=TitusHand>Plight is the rite unto thee</span></p>
<p><span class=TitusHand>Smite with a spite the blight of the Nightmen</span></p>
<p><span class=TitusHand>Tomorrow is beholden to me</span></p>
<p><span class=TitusHand>Fight for your life, set fire to flames</span></p>
<p><span class=TitusHand>And the Firebrands furrow a way</span></p>
<p><span class=TitusHand>Find the old Light &apos;fore the sin of the Fall</span></p>
<p><span class=TitusHand>And reclaim what was taken from me</span></p>
<p><span class=TitusHand>Set upon your shoulders the remorseful millstone</span></p>
<p><span class=TitusHand>And toil &apos;till Essence is dry</span></p>
<p><span class=TitusHand>The Golden Age waits where the weakness is gone</span></p>

<p><span class=TitusHand>Right is the fight for Humanity&apos;s cause</span></p>
<p><span class=TitusHand>Tomorrow is beholden to me</span></p>
<p>&emsp;The last sung syllable dissolves to silence, and in the space that remains, the entire city is left to reflect on what our ancestors left behind. Ellie disappears inside before I can catch the door, captured by the excitement of coloring her pictures. Her flaxen hair spills from her head in strands of golden fiber as she sprawls across the kitchen floor. It sways with every stroke of the death-gripped purple crayon tightened in her fist, scrawling away on stray sheets she took from Seminary.</p>
<p>&emsp;My sister hums the tune of the Benediction since she doesn&apos;t yet remember the words. The wind slams the door behind me as I remove my thick coat. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What happened to a &apos;hello?&apos;&quot; I ask, twisting off my gloves and deposititing them on the holds of the rack.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;&apos;Hello?&apos;  You didn&apos;t &apos;hello&apos; me in days,&quot; Ellie says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s fair,&quot; I mutter. &quot;But did Father come by?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No.&quot; She kicks her feet behind her, unfazed by the thought.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I&apos;m sorry that I was gone for an extra day. We got held up beyond the walls. We had to spend a night two days away from the city, can you believe that?&quot; I ask, expecting the smallest sliver of interest, but all she manages is a grunt. </p>
<p>&emsp;When I approach, I notice it&apos;s one of her worksheets from Seminary. They&apos;re learning about the spiritual armor of the Firebrand. </p>
<p>&emsp;Putting aside her avid disinterest, I ask about her artistic vision. Purple, huh? I don&apos;t think any of the Firebrands I know are allowed to wear purple. It&apos;s different shades of red, with a little bit of yellow.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Her eyes focus harder. &quot;But mine will be purple,&quot; she states. &quot;It&apos;s the best color.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The color of the Chymaera? Of the enemy?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;My favorite color,&quot; she insists. &quot;Red and blue together. Blue like the sky should be, and red like everything else.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Like what?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Like the clothes the older kids wear. Like your cheeks and nose when you walk inside. Like blood. Like Essence, when it dries.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then maybe you can convince the Grandmaster General to change our wardrobe. He wouldn&apos;t listen to me, and I was the top student in our school.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m the best in my class, they say,&quot; Ellie says. I think to myself that it&apos;s a miracle that she&apos;s so self-sufficient: far more than any kid her age should ever be forced to be. Forced like I was, even before her age.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;m so proud of you,&quot; I tell her. But when I take a closer look at her homework, I notice all the written parts aren&apos;t filled out. &quot;You know you&apos;re supposed to write what each of the armor pieces mean first, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I hate that part!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;If you hate words, you won&apos;t be able to speak,&quot; I tell her. I drag the pint-sized wooden chair in from the playroom, etched with the name TITUS NATHANIEL BERGUARD from when I was a toddler. When it gets me to her level, I lean forward, afraid my full weight could shear the legs straight off.</p>
<p>&emsp;Ellie sneezes. The house is covered in dust, and I can&apos;t remember the last time I cleaned it. It&apos;s what I hired the caretakers for: once every two weeks.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;How about we do it together?&quot; I offer, for the third time this week.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No. I&apos;m too tired,&quot; she says. &quot; I feel sick.&quot; And then her sniffles make sense: maybe it&apos;s not just allergies after all.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you have Seminary in the morning, so it needs to be done,&quot; I say. She glares at me as I go in her backpack: the planner I bought for her has several unchecked boxes, along with the rest of the Firebrand&apos;s Armor sheets scrunched and stuffed like packing paper. &quot;Ellie, this is due tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know, but I don&apos;t want to!&quot; she shouts.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;If you did some of this yesterday, you wouldn&apos;t have had to do them all tonight,&quot; I say. &quot;Come on.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I snatch the drawing from the floor. With her face screwed up, she stands to stams her feet in protest. &quot;But Carrie never help me last night!&quot; The tutor. &quot;She never came.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You can have this back after you finish the first one,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No! No, no, no, no,&quot; she says, her amethyst eyes glowing with a familiar anger.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, yes, yes. This is important,&quot; I tell her. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why can&apos;t I be a pitcher-drawer like Sylvia?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sylvia does that on the side. She&apos;s smart to start.&quot; I un-crumple the assignment and place it on the kitchen counter, but she swats it away.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;I wish Gran-pa Ev was here. He&apos;s nice to me,&quot; Ellie says. &quot;Not you. He let me eat sweets! And he let me stay up late.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That was years ago,&quot; I tell her. &quot;You didn&apos;t have school yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well I hate it,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I rest my head in my hands, turning away from her icy glare to address the ghost of my mother. &quot;I&apos;m just trying to do my best,&quot; I mutter.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I hate you,&quot; she adds. &quot;I don&apos;t want to, and you should do it for me again.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then we&apos;ll do it together,&quot; I say, glancing at my watch, wondering if I&apos;ll have to sleep on the couch again.</p>
<p>&emsp;She takes a beat in anger before the exhaustion on my face gets through to her. &quot;Fine, then,&quot; she says, dragging a chair to my side of the kitchen table, making sure it screeches across every inch of the floor.</p>
<p>&emsp;It takes us a mere two minutesto write the first one, and she doesn&apos;t even need my help. Watching the candlelight flicker on her face reminds me of her mother in the smallest nuances of the creases in her face, and I find it fills me with a certain warmth.</p>
<p>&emsp;She starts the second crumpled sheet.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what is this one?&quot; I point to the purple picture on the page.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The helmet of faith,&quot; Ellie says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what does it do?  Write in the box,&quot; I tell her, as she scribes the first three words.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;To trust the Alakytes to get us things to live,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. The Acolytes,&quot; I say, pointing to the mispelled word a seminarian shouldn&apos;t have to know yet. &quot;And that &mdash; what&apos;s that below it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The belt of burden,&quot; she says. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what does it do?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It holds up the pants.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;The line hits where the exhaustion weakens me the most. I laugh and laugh, until Ellie&apos;s offense eventually boils over into laughter.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it holds up the pants!&quot; She insists, gesturing an imaginary pair of pants, chuckling as she tries to straighten her face.</p>
<p>&emsp;I ask, &quot;The pants? And  . . . and what would the pants do, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The pants of, uh . . . pants of patience.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Patience?&quot; I run her creative mind further. &quot;Patience for what?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Uh, patience for when you gotta go pee or poo, to not take them off,&quot; she says. &quot;Because you can&apos;t do it in the store, or in the street, you have to wait.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel the tears crest my eyes as she begins to write it down. &quot;Stop, stop,&quot; I say. She laughs again, and I&apos;m unsure whether she&apos;s developed an intentional sense of humor yet.</p>
<p>&emsp;She asks, &quot;What do the pants do, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There are no pants,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;She gestures to my trousers. &quot;You wear the Fire pants.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, I have pants. But the armor is a metaphor,&quot; I tell her. &quot;It means something symbolic. It makes you remember certain things when you think about it, the stuff that&apos;s good for us to remember.&quot; Her mind spins over the thought as she stares at my pants, piecing together what I mean. &quot;Like the thing we just said &mdash; the Benediction &mdash; before Lighttime becomes Darktime.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh,&quot; she says. The pen idles on the page, scrawling circles in the corner. &quot;So the belt isn&apos;t actually a belt,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sort of. But it&apos;s what it means that we care about,&quot; I tell her. &quot;So what does it mean to us? What do we carry?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The badness, of how we lost our gift. We can&apos;t do what the Gods said we could do, with fire and life. But not the people on the big mountain, up there getting us food and stuff we need.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Close enough,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But why, though?&quot; She asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why what?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All the badness of the scaredy people that used their Essence to run away: why is their bad on us now? We didn&apos;t do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because we are the last Humans left. We are the only ones that can make good on all that &apos;badness&apos; and make our people better.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She pauses for a moment. &quot;I think Dad is one of the bad ones,&quot; she says. &quot;He runs like them. But like the belt is not a belt, he&apos;s not running. Just scared, like, running without moving,&quot; Ellie says.</p>
<p>&emsp;My heart sinks a little as she wraps up the last words of her worksheet. There&apos;s so little I can offer, so I say: &quot;Dad would be really sad if he heard you say that.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But he should be here more,&quot; she says. &quot;Not the nanny. And you should be here!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I am here.&quot; I can feel the temperature rise, loathing how circumstance rhymes across generations. &quot;I come here every day I can. I pay for the house to try to let you live somewhere nice.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Houses are only nice when people are in them,&quot; she says, and though it tears at me, the only response I have is to do what my father never could.</p>
<p>&emsp;I wrap my arms around her, relishing in her warmth, thankful for the space she takes up, and I enjoy the weight of her as I lift her into the air. But she rests her arms at her side, without a hug in response.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why didn&apos;t you let them take me?&quot; She asks, and the question startles me. She&apos;s talking about the papers Clint told me to sign. The day before graduation, he forced me into a meeting with Child Services &mdash; and maybe I&apos;m fortunate they don&apos;t care about their jobs, because I care for her more than anyone else can. </p>
<p>&emsp;It fills me with a certain guilt every time I see the crescents in her eyes, the dirt on her skin, but what&apos;s stronger is the anger I have for the carelessness of my father.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;Because you&apos;re mine. And because you deserve better.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;Better than being alone and unwanted like I was, in the orphanage. Better with someone loving you sincerely. Regardless of the fact that they lined up some infertile rich family in Province Eight to take care of her like their own.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I love you so much,&quot; I tell her, but I can feel the disappointment in the way she slumps with dead weight.</p>

<p>&emsp;I head for my apartment. It&apos;s way too late to watch the sun touch the horizon, to soak in even the smallest sensation of warmth through the smog. There is hardly night or day in Blackwater. Most of the time it&apos;s dark, though the sun never sets. It just hangs in the sky, sometimes dipping for moments below the mountains. All we have is Lighttime and Darktime, driven by the man-made cycle of electric light on a schedule. </p>
<p>&emsp;The lower city is sleepless as it always is, the generator workers encrusted with soot and sweat as they emerge from the power plants, trading shifts with others whose schedules never afford them the Lighttime: to me, it&apos;s been motivation to do better in the Academy, a reminder of what happens if I don&apos;t maintain my echelon among the top ranks. Too many cadets fail to return from battle as it is already &mdash; while the top classes are promised the highest ranks in the service, the lowest cadets are first fodder for the front lines. And if they do survive, their dreadful, dragging lives that follow make them regret it.</p>
<p>&emsp;There are privileges to the highest ranks of the Academy. They are the benefits I earn, but I never have the time to enjoy or take advantage of. Cadets in the academy are coined &quot;Firebrands,&quot; after the stray embers that spread wildfires far beyond their place of origin. Brought together, these Firebrands form Fireteams, clusters of four cadets raised together since early childhood, forming formidable friendships and bonds that carry into their service beyond the walls. Together, Romin, Valentina, Sylvia and I constitute Fireteam 473, one of the few groups skilled enough to rank among the top one percent. </p>
<p>&emsp;But I&apos;m not the only member to abandon their privilege &mdash;&mdash; in fact, Sylvia is the only one to continually take residence in the towers (and although my abandonment errs on the side of service, Valentina and Romin haven&apos;t so much as lived there.) </p>
<p>&emsp;Whether by hedonism or loyalty, Valentina and Romin enjoy lavish lifestyles at the forefront of their factions, connected by blood to the highest powers of the Merlot and the Carmine. Romin is consumed in his promise to become the Son of the Carmine. Valentina . . . I don&apos;t really have any idea what she does up in her Vermillion Tower unless her family&apos;s extravagant parties bring us up there. But considering that coveted geothermal warmth of the sprawling central peaks &mdash; shrouded in mystery by smog and clouds that shadow anything of their wealth &mdash; I doubt they&apos;ll be burning any money staying warm while the whole rest of the city lives on ice. </p>
<p>&emsp;Trains take cadets to-and-from the city in large droves, packed tight with little space to spare, the only available type of transit through the inner walls. My commitments always leave me at the tail-end of any rush hour when the trolley cars are near empty, when only the residents of the Academy and their guests are able to ride, and they&apos;re often heavily intoxicated, headed back after a long darktime of drinking, steeling themselves to fight a horrendous hangover.</p>
<p>&emsp;Before the Snowdrifter run, our fireteam went into the city to celebrate the start of the break, and with half-price drinks on the Academy stipend, I was trying to forget a lot when I went in there.</p>
<p>&emsp;I trace through my memories of that darktime. Valentina concealed herself with a woven pink sunhat in the absence of sun. She gets catty and loud after the first few rounds, but it&apos;s easy to tolerate when she ends up buying the drinks. While she was occupied chatting-up her fans, Romin&apos;s solemn stare scared them off, allowing them no more than a question of her name before they duck for another crowd.</p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia&apos;s always light on clothes. She wore one of Valentina&apos;s (many) old dresses, untailored to her measurements, crushing her in a space that Valentina could barely fill. It made me laugh, how misplaced the vibrant colors of Val&apos;s wardrobe were on Sylvia&apos;s body: most days Sylvia struggled to get ready, showing up to lectures with her hair still damp. In my presence, she always seemed to reject the advances from any suitors that offered her a hand. The crimson mark and hood were enough to get Romin and I a fair amount of attention, though at least I never pursued it. All I could remember were several faces of nameless women, Romin whispering &apos;too ugly&apos; or &apos;too fat&apos; or &apos;you can do better than that&apos; until he stopped judging for me and got wrapped up with someone else. I chatted with a girl whose name I forgot. And after Romin quickly disappeared, Sylvia left upset, and Valentina absconded off with another high-ranking firebrand. Academy dating is shallow, the way cadets pursue one-night stands and drunken nights to quell their crippling anxieties of the unknown world that awaits them. At least for the middle and lower classes, the overdose deaths, grievous injuries, and suicides got so severe that each graduating class was forcibly placed on dry probation at least two weeks before the ceremony that sent them beyond the walls. Whoever that girl was, she just wanted a taste of the world a little higher towards the clouds, and I wanted no part of that emptiness.</p>
<p>&emsp;The Dragon Class tower is a great stone edifice from two-hundred-and-fifty years ago, once a mansion of the richest families in Blackwater before the Fall of Nordhaven, repurposed for Academy cadets. Inside the front doors spreads a posh interior with crystal chandeliers and carpets brighter red than the midday sun through the smoke. Several cadets stand inside, faces I hardly recognize, and the distaste of conversation carries me around the corner to the back entrance, up the poorly-lit stairwell, and into my room, where I can be alone.</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m drawn to darkness like moths to flame. It&apos;s not a feeling of comfort, really&mdash;when I lay in bed and stare at the same ceiling, so familiar with the contours of every crack that I can close my eyes and still see them, it&apos;s a feeling of cessation, but not a feeling of comfort. I find no reason to move once I lay there. Sometimes I hold my breath until I find a convincing reason to release, thinking one day I might suffocate, but that primal fear always drives the wind back into my lungs. </p>
<p>&emsp;Is that what I live for, then? Do I live for fear?</p>
<p>&emsp;It feels like I&apos;m attached to everything but feel nothing. My eyes trace the contours of the room after they adjust. It feels like a crypt, and with the windows open, no energy will ever enter or exit this place. Two years here and it&apos;s still empty: the only things I&apos;ve brought to this place are a folding chair, several books, and enough clothes to get through each week. The floors are spotless and polished from the cleaners; dust and spiderwebs would accumulate in the corners otherwise, and on the table still rests a yellowed card that reads WELCOME FIREBRAND! CONGRATS ON YOUR DRAGON CLASS ACHIEVEMENT.</p>
<p>&emsp;Hours pass. Or minutes. I&apos;m not sure. It feels almost as if I&apos;m outside of time. Maybe if I lay here forever, I&apos;ll never have to say goodbye to Ellie myself. I can&apos;t get myself to sign the papers. I fear the future for the atrophy of close bonds with my friends, few in number but so strong in connection, and I know that no matter what I simply can&apos;t let go. Sometimes it feels I float over a vacuous space, tethered there by the finest threads of past desires, of a time when I might have known what I wanted out of this life. Entropy dissolves. The smoke never returns to the cigar once it leaves. When Ellie mixes the peas and carrots that I chop for her, they never return to the same order as when I first prepared it. And so the threads of passion fray like the telomeres that age me: they got me to the top of my class, and the only way there is without emotion.</p>
<p>&emsp;The future is entirely blank, and it terrifies me. The escapism lies in my memories: painted through the rose-colored glasses of those chapters of my life when my mother was around and Ellie was just born. Clint was a good father, then, who had the energy to reach beyond himself &mdash; he&apos;d take me on his shoulders after a long day, and often grill for us late in the evenings &mdash; he could make the cheapest cut of whatever we could afford taste amazing. But the uncertainty of our future still lingers there.</p>
<p>&emsp;I stir myself beneath bundles of weighted blankets to keep me warm when I hear a knock outside. Probably for someone else, I think. Unit 407 next door is a party room, and they&apos;re always drinking. </p>
<p>&emsp;But the knock persists. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;Open up.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;I lay in bed, thinking if I stay here, she won&apos;t think I&apos;m home. Anything leading me closer to that red-hot, painful reality of our separation drives me further away.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know you&apos;re in there. I know you, Titus,&quot; she says, but I still don&apos;t feel myself move. Like holding my breath. Waiting until I find a reason to get up, to participate.</p>
<p>&emsp;A minute passes. Maybe another, and she knocks one last time. I watch the two shadows beneath the crack of the door disappear, and the disappointment of a self-hatred overtakes me that I could let this moment pass.</p>
<p>&emsp;I open the door. &quot;Hey,&quot; I say, weakly, and she turns around from walking halfway down the hall. I comb my mess of jet-black hair into some semblance of order, and she lets out a trite laugh.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Mr. Valedictorian. Hope you&apos;re not playing too hard with your time off,&quot; she says. I feel the same sadness in her eyes of our upcoming separation. Her posture hunches like usual &mdash; if she ever stood tall, she&apos;d be taller than me. &quot;You really worry me sometimes, Titus.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;I&apos;m fine. Just a little nervous, I guess, you know.&quot; My eyes struggle to meet hers, but they persist, weakly, to look in her bright-red rings. She&apos;s wearing makeup. I can&apos;t remember the last time she dressed this nicely. </p>
<p>&emsp;She looks beautiful.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Merlot&apos;s Graduate Ball just started, and I&apos;m sure it will be going all night,&quot; she says. &quot;You still have a chance to go.&quot; It might be the last, she means.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So why aren&apos;t you there?&quot; I ask. &quot;Why did you leave?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not the same without the person I wanted to spend it with,&quot; she says. &quot;You&apos;re the one who holds our friendship together. Romin doesn&apos;t have anyone to bounce his sultry jokes off of, and Valentina&apos;s energy feels more like her acting than anything real. We all feel there&apos;s someone missing. And me? I&mdash;&quot; The door blows open. She shivers. &quot;Ugh, it&apos;s so fridging cold in there. Are the windows open?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Forgot to shut them,&quot; I say, though I know she disbelieves me. I close the windows and turn on the heater. She follows me in, closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>&emsp;&quot;You sacrifice so much, yet you take so little. I worry so often that you never take enough,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I sit next to her. She reclines on the bed, sprawled with her arms against the sheets.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But others need me,&quot; I tell her. &quot;I can&apos;t give up on them. In this life, I&apos;ve come to realize that I was born a sacrifice. The orphanage, taking care of you, fighting hard enough that we&apos;d amount to anything, it&apos;s what I&apos;m good at.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But you never release the weight of all that negativity,&quot; she says. </p>
<p>&emsp;I just wish I had time,&quot; I say. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sometimes you just have to let go, Titus,&quot; Sylvia insisted, &quot;no matter how painful it is, you have to succumb to it.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;But she&apos;s wrong. </p>
<p>&emsp;That kind of thinking is why her combat scores are so far below us, unable to toughen up, too lost in soft hobbies to galvanize herself in the crucible of combat. </p>
<p>&emsp;But I&apos;ll never tell her that. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t always have to be so polarized towards strength. It&apos;s okay to have others protect you,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And thinking like that is what will kill us on the outside,&quot; I say. &quot;You know how many people return&mdash;&mdash; how they say &apos;softness of the mind and tongue dulls your blade.&apos;&quot; Her insistence doesn&apos;t faze me at all, and although the sickness of a storm rages inside me, I know it is just the strength of my spirit, the endurance of my determination.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;If you say so. I pray to the Gods the world can one day prove you different,&quot; Sylvia replies. </p>
<p>&emsp;I change the subject, just to hold her here longer. </p>
<p>&emsp;She talks on about her work, designing posters for the Academy, how annoying lettering is writing FEAR THE CHYMAERA! a hundred-or-so times, how her hands shake on her third cup, how hard it is to make deadlines. I just like to listen to her speak. I love to hear the sound of her voice and the smallest mannerisms of her speech. When you have a friend for this long, it reminds you the world still spins beyond the horizon of your own fears and worries, and it feels like a stabilizing center-of-gravity.</p>
<p>&emsp;She rests her head against my shoulder&mdash;just like our late nights at the orphanage as kids&mdash;as if she&apos;s drawing energy from the warmth of my body, enough to get her by for the rest of the week. &quot;You know, it&apos;s an anomaly.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;How you&apos;re so handsome and wonderful, but you can&apos;t land someone special,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I shrug. &quot;Maybe one day. When I&apos;m ready and I have the time,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;A little while later, when we say goodnight, she gives be a big, sweet hug and I embrace her tightly, almost as if to say she understood it all completely, and I relished just long enough before the discomfort made me release.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I love you,&quot; Sylvia says. Then she quickly adds, &quot;We all love you, Titus.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know,&quot; I say. &quot;And . . . you too, Sylvia. Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I watch her leave as a certain emptiness sits in my stomach, much like the room behind me. For such a spacious, designer room, it perplexed me why a single pole stabbed through from the ceiling to the floor, inexplicably there, just like the houses beyond the walls, or like a dagger in a drawer of spoons. I found my arms wrapped around it again, feeling the minutes pass until the distance had dissolved, and that hollow space had been filled, or masked, or stabilized, with something strong enough to set me back to sleep.</p>
<p>&emsp;I leave the windows open.</p>

<p>&emsp;I lay on the hardwood floor. Perverse thoughts in my mind tell me I don&apos;t deserve the comfort of the bed, so I lay there, listening to the reverberations of a party below.</p>
<p>&emsp;I let time pass by for what feels like hours, until I think my guilt can lift me from the floor, but it never arrives. I think about the radiant glow of the necklace enveloping my father&apos;s shop&mdash;it wasn&apos;t the first time that an Outwaller artifact had gone off on us. In fact, it is my only proof that a God might exist, and the absurdity of those moments often blend into the dullness of my daily life &mdash; saturated in propaganda posters, in crimson-font books administered by the Ministry of Courage, and in the repetition of combat training where we&apos;re pitted against other fireteams.</p>
<p>&emsp;The hardwood floor doesn&apos;t bother me. I&apos;m used to sleeping on rough surfaces after years of survival training in the Academy, drilling as my team&apos;s Tactician or unofficial leader, and so I feel myself melt into the hardness of the floor.</p>
<p>&emsp;The same dream comes to me. For a moment I stand in the infinite space of a dark landscape, the smell of ozone overpowering. Is it beyond the walls? A great cavern? Or somewhere beyond space itself? Thousands of graves lie before me on an endless plane of ash. Most of the bodies wear Academy marks, others wear ordinary clothes, and almost all of them seem to be the same age. I pray they aren&apos;t dreams of a horrible future. I hope they&apos;re not the lives of my fellow cadets in our service beyond the walls. I spend so many nights in this lifeless internal space &mdash; I&apos;m unable to move, without a body, just a spectator to the grounds of a boundless crypt, but I can feel the coldness of my surroundings. I can imagine the abrasiveness of the ash, hear the crackle of distant fires, cascading embers from indiscernible skies and amethyst glows in the veins of rotten flesh. No words are spoken here, there is no one left to speak them. I am just a ghost of a forgotten time, bearing witness to either a horrendous future or a miserable nightmare.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s almost time.&quot; The voice speaks from a directionless origin. Its vibrations resonate within me. Am I speaking it to someone else? Or is it a voice of an internal force? Or&mdash;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Years you&apos;ve lived since that time. Maybe you&apos;ve forgotten, or tried to forget. But your connection has been snagged on that incident, that choice.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I try my vocal chords, but nothing resonates; all I can do is listen. A whole life I&apos;ve lived with only the memory of the orphanage, of the brutal fights and violence to prove my worth as a tool galvanized by teeth and blood.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A column of light marks the start of your true journey. Only if you accept the natural path, will you ever be free.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Darkness swallows the forms in the furthest distance. The bubble of this dream is collapsing. I can hear my voice being called from somewhere far beyond. The ground shakes. Ash shudders and lifts into the air like a great sandstorm on the gale of otherworldly winds, and everything begins to crumble to dust, returning to the most basic form of all matter.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Die to yourself or you will live forever, son.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;A sound at the corner of the stairwell awakes me. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus! Titus.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Heavy footfalls cascade against the carpet. Light seeps through the edges of the blackout curtains. Gods, It&apos;s almost afternoon. How long was I asleep?</p>
<p>&emsp;The footsteps are heavy, but not that heavy. Boots. Was it Sylvia? Or Valentina? No way she&apos;d come down here.</p>
<p>&emsp;A fist pounds on the door. &quot;Titus, Titus, open up,&quot; a voice slurs. The voice sounds drunk, male. But it isn&apos;t Romin.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Who&apos;s asking?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Dammit. Open the door, son.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint? What are you doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just open up,&quot; he demanded. But why&mdash; he stays in the store as if he&apos;s chained to it. I hear his heavy breathing&mdash;either he took a flight of stairs too fast or is on the verge of throwing up.</p>
<p>&emsp;I lift myself from the floor. My knees crack. The door opens, cracked. But I&apos;m wrong: he isn&apos;t drunk. Fear flushes his face, an emotion I haven&apos;t seen in him since I can remember.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sons&apos;a bitches broke in, Titus,&quot; he says, &quot;I couldn&apos;t stop them, they took that damn thing you brought in. Told them we were closed, told them to come in the lighttime, first it was the Carmine, then bastards wearin&apos; all black, and...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Slow down,&quot; I say. His face swells with bruises. Dried blood runs in two parallel lines from his nose, and he can hardly speak, and I want to tell him that I told him so. &quot;When did this happen?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I was sleepin&apos; in the back room. Heard a knock on the door, told them the store was closed,&quot; he says. &quot;First it was the Carmine. Said they&apos;d be willing to pay handsomely for that thing you brought in earlier, knew we had it, they saw the light. Told us that the next party to show up would kill for it. I told them to wait &apos;till lighttime when we were open, but &apos;no,&apos; they said, &apos;they&apos;ll kill you for it if we don&apos;t take it now,&apos; they says. &apos;Then let them come,&apos; I say.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Carmine came for it first,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;He nods. &quot;Gods, I should have just let the Carmine take it, I didn&apos;t think they were serious. The next group came an hour ago. Dressed in all black. Said they were from the City Guard, but they didn&apos;t look like guards. Said they was trying to keep all the humans alive. On my, last refusal then they kicked down the door, a whole lot of &apos;em, and they took the necklace right from my hands.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I asked, &quot;So what does that have to do with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You mean, your injured father? Broken doors that&apos;ll cost a week&apos;s earnings for a locksmith?&quot; Clint says. The only thing that holds him to this life is threatened. The existential horror registers in his expression. &quot;My shop . . . er, our shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel the apathy swell within me, and the approach of my uncertain future grate on me. My focus is far beyond this.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s your shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean? It&apos;s ours,&quot; he says. It almost seems like my father is on the verge of tears, and it frightens me, but I still feel that force of resentment and anger that tears me from him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ours only when you want it to be. I have so much more to deal with right now.&quot; The anger pushes the next words. &quot;More important things.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well . . . you, I . . . I just wanted . . .&quot; he stammers, but it eludes him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then I guess you should &apos;quit being a pussy and handle it,&apos;&quot; I tell him, before slamming the door. His somber footsteps drag him away. I hear a sniffle.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You know, you leaving and all . . . I know I&apos;m not good with feelings, but it&apos;s just as hard for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;So hard he can&apos;t show up to my graduation, to see my speech, on the most important day of my life. I could tell he was day-drinking during that time. I could smell it on his breath. I don&apos;t respond, and he walks further. A sickness in my stomach rises as the distance grows between us. Is it guilt I feel? Do I feel bad? Or does his absence feel healing?</p>
<p>&emsp;His voice is so different from normal that it haunts me. &quot;Promise we&apos;ll talk. There&apos;s so much I want to say to you. I&apos;m terrible with feelings, and you are, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I sit on the floor, back against the door, but my vocal chords refuse.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve always . . .&quot; he says, but can&apos;t finish the thought before discomfort overtakes him, and a deep, saturating pain stings inside my heart. I sit on the verge of tears, but my eyes remain dry, building pressure there instead. </p>

<p>&emsp;The rest of the day passes slowly. Three days remain before we&apos;re called to action. The phone on my desk rattles on occasion with calls from the operator, so I unplug it. Knocks sound on the door, but I can&apos;t lift myself.</p>
<p>&emsp;I eat snacks stashed beneath my bed. I throw the wrappers on the floor. The maid service has ended; no one will be around anymore to pick them up. I wonder how many cadets have passed through this space, how differently each Firebrand might have furnished it. Over there is a window with a beautiful view. Four scuff marks speak that it was once a place where a couch peered out. A smaller spread near the opposite wall shows where a film projector might have rested, brought by some rich cadet, and I recall that on my first night here, I found reels of a movie called &quot;Fear The Chymaera&quot; left behind, one that Valentina acted in as a child. Did this place once hold celebrations? How many people have passed through the front door? And how many of them are alive today, living somewhere in the city?</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s the transience of such a space that is so hard to believe, how many proud families unpacked their children&apos;s furniture and closets into this room. Beyond the walls of this temporary home, loud bustling and burdened voices echo through the halls. The Firebrands unpack their things, leaving these spaces vacant for the next proud cadets to live. This space is naught but a temporary place of residence; a base camp, if you will; a place of operations; a bed to sleep and a desk to work; not holding permanence of any kind.</p>
<p>&emsp;But I have so little to pack.</p>
<p>&emsp;Nowhere has ever felt permanent. The bills for my childhood home pile up on my desk, and I&apos;ve finally crossed the threshold where all my savings can no longer hold. The demands from the child welfare service are addressed to me now, threatening to take Ellie from me, and for months I&apos;ve ripped them up. I refuse to believe that they will take her: lies of families all over the capital, in other districts, that avidly pursue her. But where else could she be comfortable beside in my arms?</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;ll be away on service for a while. But I can make it work. I&apos;ll make more money. I can pay for the tutors. Hell, maybe Clint will take over. I can pay for the housekeepers, all the people that will keep the house the same way I remembered it. I can love her from a distance. I know I can, and just that idea gives me the strength to move on.</p>
<p>&emsp;Another darktime approaches. And at one point, I hear commotion from the balcony next door. Upset voices&mdash;too late to be anything related to moving, since the dragging ended hours ago, and the service elevator hasn&apos;t chimed since I last awoke from my third nap.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, you can&apos;t just barge in here. Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just a second,&quot; the voice says. &quot;Did you know your neighbor&apos;s deaf? He can&apos;t hear me unless I barge in.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Get out!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The sliding door on the adjacent balcony rattles open, slamming as it reaches the end of its track. I hear a sound of heavy effort. Some massive creature moves beyond the window glass of my balcony door.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, you&apos;re going to kill yourself,&quot; my neighbors say, but the figure continues grunting. &quot;You&apos;re going to break the railing! You&apos;re paying for&mdash;Help! Anyone, get in here!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I hear metal screech. The creature shrieks in panic, and I jump from my bed, sprinting to the door. That can&apos;t actually be him. No way. I have to look like I was doing something, like I wasn&apos;t just laying in bed for two days, and so I flick the lights on, running my fingers through my hair a little, and I lift a book.</p>
<p>&emsp;A thud resounds outside somewhere. It feels as if the cantilever balcony is going to snap from the sudden load. The neighbors curse, the drunk creature laughs, and the neighbors curse even harder. The door flies open, nearly shattering the frame at the stop, and he enters.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You bastard.&quot; He heaves between breaths. &quot;You know what I had to do to get in here? Good thing those jerks next door aren&apos;t your neighbors anymore,&quot; he says, with the door still open and the neighbors on the balcony.</p>
<p>&emsp;He stumbles to the telephone resting on the only table in the room, palming the whole thing with a single hand, finding no tension pulling it downward from the power cord. The power cord is disconnected, and he knows I unplugged it.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Really? Really, Titus?&quot; he says. &quot;And what could you possibly be reading? Classes are over. Thermal Properties of Essence? I don&apos;t even know what that is, and there&apos;s no extra credit anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He swats the book out of my hands. It slams against the wall between me and my newly-disgruntled neighbors, leaving a dent in the wall that I&apos;ll probably be paying premium for.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You should be getting drunk with us. Making memories. Val and Sylvia got so upset they made me do this. No&mdash;YOU made me do this, and I&apos;m upset now, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Romin, it&apos;s just been&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Tough? Hard?&quot; he says. &quot;And you know how we deal with those feelings? We get trashed. We get trashed, and we deal with them together. We&apos;re running out of time, Titus.&quot; Romin turns me to the door. There&apos;s no refusing the grasp of someone twice your size. &quot;Open the door and say you&apos;re excited to see them,&quot; he demands.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Can I put on a shirt first?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You did this to yourself,&quot; he says, blocking my access to the rest of the room. I sigh and slowly creak it open. Valentina and Sylvia are on the other side, along with most of the hallway, peering out at the ruckus from their rooms. Their eyes trace from my face to my pajama pants, than back to my face again, a slight look of surprise and disgust mixed together.</p>
<p>&emsp;I repeat Romin&apos;s words, mechanically. &quot;I am excited, to see you,&quot; I tell them.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Can we come in? Gods. After you . . . get ready?&quot; Valentina asks, turning away from the doorway, her face blushed bright red as Sylvia turns the other way.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ready for what?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;For our night out,&quot; Valentina says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Now get ready. Take off your pants.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;In front of you? Now? Wait&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Or I&apos;ll take them off for you. I&apos;ve seen your naked ass more times than Sylvia, I&apos;m sure of it,&quot; he says, and Sylvia mutters something indiscernible from behind the door, probably flushed with color.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We don&apos;t do that,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We don&apos;t do that my ass,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Or your ass. Off. And put on some damn pants. Something nice. We&apos;re going back to the Merlot district, and Valentina&apos;s gonna get us in everywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I slip on some jeans that sprawled on the floor for days like rotten pasta, unwashed and odorous like the rest of my room.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Good. Now let your girlfriend pick a nice shirt for you,&quot; Romin says. He turns to the two girls beyond the door. &quot;He unplugged the phone, can you believe this idiot? I told you we had to save him.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re not . . .&quot; Sylvia mumbles.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You can come in,&quot; I say. My social aversion has no foot in the door against my sudden fear of Romin. And strangely, I find myself a little less empty.</p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia&apos;s face is still flushed red. &quot;A shirt . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re the artist. Pick something flashy. We&apos;re getting my boy laid tonight,&quot; Romin says. Sylvia recoils at those words with a certain disgust, bending down to thumb through my limited closet. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No.&quot; Valentina says, &quot;No, no, no, no, no. This isn&apos;t just a &apos;guys night out.&apos; This is a night for us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, one of us is getting laid tonight, at least,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Who&apos;s it going to be?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What does that even mean, Romin?&quot; Valentina asks, rhetorically, knowing there&apos;s no reconciling his madness. </p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia hands me a shirt, the one she&apos;s told me is her favorite one. &quot;Good choice,&quot; I tell her. She smiles.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The trains run until long past midnight over break. Tonight&apos;s gonna be a great night,&quot; Romin says, and he turns to me. &quot;Don&apos;t expect to come back here. You&apos;ve slept enough, pal. Time to burn off some of that energy.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I don&apos;t have any money up here,&quot; I say. &quot;If we&apos;re gonna go, let me get some from the house.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not a problem,&quot; Romin says. He turns to Sylvia and Valentina. &quot;You deserve a good celebration for how hard you&apos;ve fought to be Valedictorian, and you deserve to know how the three of us&mdash;&quot; he gestures towards them and they nod&mdash; &quot;feel strongly about you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Heat thaws my heart a little further. I smile, genuinely, putting aside the anxieties of the unsettled life I&apos;ll be leaving behind. Either way, I&apos;ll be figuring it out later. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks, guys. Let&apos;s get going then,&quot; I say. &quot;Like you said. This is a night to remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;Bright, flashing bulbs bathe the streets in blinding light, but not enough to melt the fine layer of snow on the asphalt. Speedsters and touring cars cycle past at blistering speeds, leaving parallel tracks of black ice behind. Painted posters and advertisements cover every space where a brick wall frames no windows, and illuminated signs project their slogans large enough to see a hundred yards away.</p>
<p>&emsp;The streets are flooded with activity. A cross-street sign reads Vermillion Boulevard, and remembering her ease of public recognition, Valentina dips her trademark hat to cover her features.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin makes fun of Valentina&apos;s hats again, how she infallibly wears one every day, saying that &quot;maybe she&apos;s balding,&quot; that she&apos;ll lose her fame to bad genetics. </p>
<p>&emsp;She slaps him across the face. </p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia points at the poster she designed for a play titled THE PHANTOM ABSOLUTION, telling me all the techniques of the brushstrokes and why she picked the colors. Romin and Valentina hold hands tonight for some reason. Sylvia takes my arm, and through her thick fur coat, emblazoned by the ruby marks of Dragon Class, I can feel her shiver.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;One bar?&quot; I ask. &quot;Or many?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;One. And only the best,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;You&apos;re on Vermillion boulevard. We have to go to Club Vermillion. A whole luxury row reserved by our family every night, whether we use it or not,&quot; she boasts.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just along for the ride,&quot; I say. I&apos;m the only one strong enough to drag Romin&apos;s drunk corpse home, even if it&apos;s only a tenth of the way. </p>
<p>&emsp;I turn to him. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Do you mind sleeping on the street again? Last time you were picking up half-smoked cigarette butts and smoking them down to the nub, saying you wouldn&apos;t leave any &apos;wounded soldiers.&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not this time,&quot; he says. &quot;Because this isn&apos;t a &apos;guys night out,&apos; right, Val?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gross,&quot; she replies.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin leads the pack. He cuts through the downstream crowds like a boulder through eddies, and we follow behind him, with me as the anchor. So many other Cadets walk with their fireteams, parting at the sight of our insignias. I get several congratulations in passing on being the Valedictorian. Most of them stumble. Some shout at the touring cars. Fewer get into fights, and even less are entirely sober. With all the shimmering crimson cloaks, it looks like a river of blood through the veins of our city&apos;s streets&mdash;but at the end, furnished in grandiose, crystalline decorations and gold-plated brick is Club Vermillion, with a line stretching far up the block.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Vermillion,&quot; Valentina tells the bouncer when we arrive.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s the name of the place,&quot; he says. &quot;Get in line.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Valentina Vermillion,&quot; she states, lifting her hat, as the other three of us stand off to the side, making small talk, and I&apos;m the only one who watches the exchange.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Miss. You&apos;re not on the list anymore,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why, my family owns this bloody place, it&apos;s in the name,&quot; she says, embarrassed, looking around to see if anyone noticed. I lower my eyes, pretending to listen to Romin ramble on about why the Carmine-allied pub is better. She refuses to raise her voice further. A scene is the last thing she wants to make. &quot;If you don&apos;t let me in, I&apos;ll have your job! Who made the request?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It was Mother Vermillion,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; she whispers. &quot;Just let us in. Last time I&apos;ll be bothering anyone for this, Marcel.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He draws a breath in indecision. He checks his watch. &quot;I&apos;m gonna be reporting this, you know. To your family.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t care about my family. Just the name,&quot; Valentina says. Romin and Sylvia turn their heads, but they don&apos;t hear her, thinking it to be friendly conversation.</p>
<p>&emsp;Marcel steps away from the door. &quot;Right this way,&quot; he says, and we follow Valentina in. She tips her hat upwards, and a line of frustrated glares quickly exchange for recognition. &quot;Valentina! Valentina!&quot; they shout, but she doesn&apos;t turn an eye. Instead, a look of disappointment and sadness dissolves under the influence of her theatric prowess, traded so suddenly for her family&apos;s famed charisma that lights up an entire room.</p>

<p>&emsp;The Vermillion VIP section is tucked to the right of the stage, always reserved, so close to the live band that you could practically walk-on and play. It seems the rest of the staff is unaware of her sudden loss of access. I see a relief settle in Valentina&apos;s eyes when the section is empty: she probably anticipated the presence of her father, Vince; her older sister, Vera; youngest sister Vanna; young brother, Virgil; or her vile mother, Victoria.</p>
<p>&emsp;We approach the single booth, surprised to find half-empty drink glasses when we settle in. &quot;Looks like someone&apos;s been here,&quot; Romin says, and a sudden look of fear crests her face. </p>
<p>&emsp;I can feel her ego disturbed by that uncertainty. &quot;It&apos;s fine. My family must have been here. Probably left since it got so busy, ironic how they own several clubs and hate excessively loud noise,&quot; she laughs.</p>
<p>&emsp;But as we sit down, she catches the eye of someone else in the crowd. Her calm charisma is no match for the fright that shocks her, and I follow her eyes. It&apos;s her sister, Vera, along with her Class VI fireteam, dancing on the main floor: one of the few high-ranking groups that managed to reach above us.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sister, so great to see you,&quot; Valentina says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m surprised you made it in, dear,&quot; Vera says, and Val&apos;s lucky the rest of them take it as a joke. &quot;We were sitting here first, but you&apos;re welcome to join us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The other three members of her fireteam are cadets I&apos;ve only confronted on the combat field and in passing: some of the few that could beat me, higher achievers than us as a collective.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin! How&apos;s District Twelve treating you?&quot; Jarrett says, embellished with the same rare crimson pin that denotes high Carmine leadership.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s eyes darken. &quot;Still functioning,&quot; he says. &quot;So your family leads District Seven.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; he says. &quot;I just like Academy Twelve better, I guess. My family figured it was much easier than the District Seven academy. How&apos;s your family?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin scrunches a little, an unsettling sight. He mumbles. &quot;The Brotherhood is great. My family, though&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. That&apos;s right. I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s fine,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;re lucky. Leadership is a lot easier when you have the shoulders of giants to stand on, and a father to . . . you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;Well, District Twelve is still remembered the best. Your brother was a great hero. Ryder, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; Romin says, shivering a little in that shadow. Before he can respond, their entourage produces a red-haired figure from behind them.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Hey, Sylvia,&quot; Delvin says, directly turning to her. &quot;I didn&apos;t get to talk to you at the Merlot Ball last night. You left so early,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot; Sorry, Delvin,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;Something came up and I had to head back.&quot; Our heads turn, and I can feel how much she despises being the center of attention.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, maybe you can make it up to me with a dance,&quot; he says, and Sylvia agrees. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s have a round of drinks!&quot; Vera exclaims, watching as Sylvia and Delvin dance to an upbeat song. Delvin&apos;s hand shifts to her waist, but no lower.</p>
<p>&emsp;The last of their posse arrives: Isla, a brilliant cadet almost a head shorter than me, applying for Intelligence. I often see her in passing&mdash;sometimes she invited me to lunch during the Academy since we had so many classes together.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Heya, Titus,&quot; she says, taking Sylvia&apos;s seat. &quot;Nice speech at graduation.&quot; The others around the table agree, exchanging words of pride over my accomplishment.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; I respond.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I took all the same classes you did,&quot; Isla says. &quot;And still . . . you managed to beat me. What&apos;s your secret?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Liquid anxiety. It&apos;s called caffeine,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, damn,&quot; she says, &quot;I did just about the same thing. A perfect grade average, and you still managed to win. How&apos;s that?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I tell her, slightly annoyed, but I can sincerely tell her energy doesn&apos;t come from jealousy, just conversation. She elbows me.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, either way we&apos;ll be seeing each other a lot. I assume you&apos;re going into intelligence? Leadership?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Something like that.&quot; As if I had the time to consider &mdash; I can hardly hold on as it is.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;My father followed the same track. The benefits are exceptional. And he empowered me to take the same path,&quot; she says, giggling as if laughter were punctuation.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I guess I&apos;ll have to look into it, then.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Vera turns to me. &quot;So what do you want to do, Valedictorian? What&apos;s the next big plan?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Whatever lets me take care of my sister and my family. I really care about her a lot,&quot; I say. &quot;And I hope working with the Royal Guard and all&mdash;either working up near the peaks of the Afterlife or out as a commander on the front lines&mdash;that I get to come back and see her.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, we&apos;re all gonna miss home. Our families,&quot; Vera says. &quot;My family has a big celebration planned for us . . . er, me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What about you, Valentina?&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;You should all be celebrating together, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She shifts uncomfortably. &quot;Er . . . yeah, but I&apos;m planning on doing my own thing!&quot; She says. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; asks Jarrett.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not with Vera. But the studio. The studio is throwing a celebration for me. Ever since I was a child, I&apos;ve been in film, and met so many people there. Just don&apos;t want to steal the thunder of a shared celebration,&quot; she says, returning an icy glare at Vera.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well I hope you visit, love,&quot; Vera replies. &quot;Because I know your family wants to see you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So,&quot; interrupts Romin. &quot;What has everyone done with their free time?&quot; He turns, prompting Valentina.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m wrapping up a photo shoot for my last film,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a great one.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Spending as much time as I can with our family. I&apos;ll miss them so much,&quot; Vera says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Preparing the documents for transition of leadership after my service,&quot; Jarrett says, &quot;and also spending time with my family. Isla?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Studying.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Studying!&quot; Vera recoils in disbelief. &quot;Studying for what? What else is there to study for, dear?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I just . . . want to be at the top of my game,&quot; she says, turning her head to me. Sitting down, we&apos;re still not close to the same height. &quot;There&apos;s still a lot of people to look up to.&quot; She turns to me.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I see,&quot; Vera says. &quot;And Titus?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Spending time with my sister. Getting all my affairs in order,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And spending most of it in your dorm,&quot; Romin says, followed by a laugh.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;In your dorm?&quot; Vera laughs. &quot;And &apos;getting your affairs in order.&apos; Are you planning to die out there?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course not,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;Isla whispers in my ear, casting surprise gooseflesh. &quot;For all that time in your room, you should have invited me.&quot; Her legs touch mine beneath the table, and I feel her hand brush my outer thigh.</p>
<p>&emsp;Jarrett cuts her off.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I just wish I had your dedication, man,&quot; he says. &quot;With that spirit and drive, he&apos;d be high in the Carmine, don&apos;t you think, Romin?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, he sure would,&quot; Romin says. I can tell that he&apos;s already drained of energy, a rare sight.</p>
<p>&emsp;Isla leans against me again. &quot;You see them over there,&quot; she says, pointing to Sylvia and Delvin. &quot;I&apos;ve been trying to set them up for ages. Delvin really likes her. I just wonder if tonight will be the night.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, really?&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I already set them up on two dates. They had coffee two days ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, really.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I guess we all just want to get some action before the end of this chapter,&quot; Isla says. Delvin and Sylvia never return to the table. I can see Delvin is really trying. Sylvia smiles. Does she like it?</p>
<p>&emsp;I refuse to look their way another time, not even noticing when the two of them disappear.</p>
<p>&emsp;We all reach our goal. Everyone is pleasantly plastered, and we leave the Vermillion Club while it&apos;s still darktime. We exchange pleasantries, planning as if there were a future time we could ever get back together again. I find myself enjoying their fireteam, and by the end of it, Romin and Jarrett are beckoning songs of the Carmine with their arms around each other, laughing and dancing as two brothers that met for the first time.</p>
<p>&emsp;Valentina falls behind with her sister, exchanging unpleasantries or something that upsets both of them. Vera embraces Valentina, and then she takes one of the courtesy travel cars for the Vermillion mansion.</p>
<p>&emsp;I fall back to talk to her. She wipes tears from her sleeves, and I ask her if she&apos;s alright.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Fine,&quot; she says. &quot;Just . . . I&apos;m not too caught up emotionally to where I should be at this point, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Is everything alright? With your family, I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. The celebration is still on.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You mean with the studio?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There is no celebration with the studio,&quot; she says. &quot;I made it up, Titus.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sorry, I won&apos;t probe further. But...&quot; I find the firewater churning in my gut usher uncomfortable feelings. &quot;...You know, you guys pulled me out of a really rough patch. Don&apos;t forget that I&apos;m here for you, too,&quot; I tell her, and she nods, tears escaping her further. </p>
<p>&emsp;I stay there as the others press on, embracing her as she buries her head into my chest, sobbing, and it makes me think of Sylvia, concerned about her, hoping that she is alright, while I feel the slightest emotion of irreversible regret. Isla catches my eye, and she waits there, realizing I fell behind, as if she waits to invite me somewhere.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You know why you&apos;re the glue that holds us together,&quot; Valentina says. Her bright, blond-white hair catches snowflakes as we bathe in the amber light of flashbulbs, still bright even in the hours just before lighttime. &quot;Because you have the heart that joins all of us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She looks at me with a glance of sincere appreciation, unmasked by the faces she wears for Academy programs and public life. Her face is untensioned, and I realize I&apos;ve never seen her in this light before.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I feel safe with you,&quot; she says. &quot;You, and Romin, and Sylvia. I&apos;m just so scared of what comes next . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Me, too,&quot; I say, taking her hand, leading her toward the rest of our group: one of the last ones to brave the frosted streets as we retreat from the warm foothills to the streetcars. I feel her fingers tension in my grasp. Her hands are warm. But all I can think of is someone else.</p>
<p>&emsp;We drop our hands. Romin&apos;s still laughing with his new best friend, forgetting all his feelings of jealousy, the both of them saluting at every Carmine brother or sister that passes as passersby glare.</p>
<p>&emsp;A hollowness urges me to motion as Isla trails behind. So many hours I&apos;ve spent alone in my room as if I could procrastinate my fears away.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Do you want to come over?&quot; Isla asks.</p>

<p>&emsp;First light flashes in the bulbs of streetlamps when I approach the railing of the eighth floor Academy lofts, drawing a cigar to my lips. I hardly smoke. Not like Romin or my father. I have a cigar when I reach the end of a frame of life, looking out upon the expanse of a beautiful view, elevated high as if to convince myself that I can see all the paths my future will take me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I breathe in the texture of past experiences, collecting those memories in my lungs to hold them in one last time before I release them forever. The words go first, then the crispness of the image, until all that&apos;s left is the feeling, only to ever be coaxed out by an artifact of that past, slipping away as silver smoke in the early morning air.</p>
<p>&emsp;Back when the world was less heavy on my shoulders, Romin and I would climb to the summit of one of Blackwater&apos;s bluffs. Though the smoke obscured so much of the city, there was a liberation in the feeling of height: as if all your problems were smaller than the scale of the familiar buildings of our childhood town far below. And after a while &mdash; between shifts of the Blackwater Electric workers, in that five-or-ten minute gap when the generators catch and lights flicker &mdash; production halts and you can hear silence for the first time in what feels like ages: not distracted by the white noise of fluorescent lights nose-deep in a textbook; not the background noise of chatter or combat in the Academy training gyms; not the stupor of drunken cadets finding any reason to celebrate on the floor above.</p>
<p>&emsp;But I never allowed myself to get used to that silence in those rapid spells of calm emptiness. The older I got, the further my life and demands took me&mdash;and the less I heard that silence ring in my ears that felt like the frequency of the world itself, beyond Essence or any gift the Gods of the Afterlife can bestow. It&apos;s probably the reason the beers I choose to drink are non-alcoholic, and why I can&apos;t indulge in more than one cigarette at a time. </p>
<p>&emsp;I only have one. </p>
<p>&emsp;I throw the rest of the pack in the trash bin and head inside, exhaustion eclipsing the episode of excitement with Isla as reality returns. The windows are still open. The shades are still drawn and the room is cold, but the comforter is so warm.</p>
<p>&emsp;Out there beyond the dusty, frosted panes of glass, silhouettes dance in rectangles of light like frames of a movie projected through a screen door. I wonder how many times it&apos;s been that I&apos;ve taken in the same sight. What view will I wake to in the next chapter? And what will be the last image every night the next hundred times I go to sleep?</p>
<p>&emsp;You can tell slumber approaches soon when your blood runs with molasses and your eyes feather shut, when your racing mind jumps between impossible tangents that hold no weight in logic or meaning. I can swear I hear that silence again when sound fades from my awareness, the faintest frequency. But the creak of my bedroom door opens my eyes with enough of a start to set me awake.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m sorry . . .&quot; Sylvia says, her words slurring, her hair disheveled and the left strap of her dress bent around the side of her shoulder.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sylvia, Gods . . . You should have called! I would have walked you home,&quot; I tell her, slurring my words too, but only because I&apos;ve left half my mind on the edge of sleep. &quot;I didn&apos;t think you were coming back to the lofts tonight, after you left with . . . him,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It wasn&apos;t much,&quot; she says. &quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But why didn&apos;t Delvin walk you?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because I didn&apos;t want to go home,&quot; she says, punctuated by a hiccup and a stutter.</p>
<p>&emsp;I rise from the sheets. Exhaustion fades fast when it&apos;s replaced with that feeling. &quot;Come here, I&apos;ll take care of you,&quot; I tell her, sitting on the edge of the bed as she approaches.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You always do, but I&apos;m okay this time. I need to tell you something. Before it wears off . . . before I lose the spirit to . . . before we run out of time,&quot; she says, as if on the verge of tears, but it&apos;s too dark to tell.</p>
<p>&emsp;I stand. &quot;Let me get you some water. I&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sit,&quot; she demands, pressing her hand against my right shoulder as she pushes me into the bed. Her breath is warm with cinnamon. Her black hair is coarse when it brushes against me. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I hoped tonight would have been so different than it was,&quot; she says, &quot;but it&apos;s always distractions, I hoped I had the chance to make you feel it, so that you might believe me when I tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I can feel my feelings stir towards their own emotional truth. But my jaw is locked, my tongue weighs heavy, and I can&apos;t usher the question to ask what she means. Nor can I meet her eyes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re drunk, Sylvia,&quot; I tell her. She looks frustrated when she can&apos;t rearrange the words in her head. I don&apos;t want her to.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No! I know, but...&quot; she insists. I stand up, walking towards the sink in the half-bathroom as she reclines on the bed as if I could escape. I&apos;m not ready. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I want you to know. That I&apos;m always watching you, ever since the orphanage, ever since you saved me from it, ever since you showed me that kindness, you know, because . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let me get you some water,&quot; I tell her. I feel my hands tremble in the sink with the cup in my hand, and it reminds me of a time I wish I could forget.</p>
<p>&emsp;When I return, she grasps the cup with shaking hands and I realize how cold she is, and I wonder how far she walked in the dark alone. My room is just as cold as the frost outside, but this time, the window is closed. I wrap two blankets as her eyes softly close. I rest my hand on her, whispering the words to myself when I know she can&apos;t hear them. The fluorescent lamps of early lighttime brighten the motes of dust like embers, and they dance with her shallow breaths as I sit there.</p>
<p>&emsp;She flinches in her sleep. Ever since the orphanage she&apos;s always dreamt of the times I tried to forget. And sometimes I find myself dreaming of the same thing.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s too dark to tell whether the tears crest in her eyes. She mutters words I can&apos;t recognize, and I can&apos;t discern whether she feigns her slumber. Her arms reach to grab for something without pillows atop the bed, and she surprises me, dragging me backwards to embrace my head in a space right beneath hers. Her grasp is strong, and once I feel the warmth and softness of her body, I find no desire to escape. My stomach still churns on fear of all the futures I can imagine. There are so many who depend on me. The ball and chain weighs heavy, but it feels so good, because at least it keeps me grounded.</p>
<p>&emsp;I should thank Romin he plugged the phone into the wall while I was changing&mdash;it awakes us near mid-morning, and I flinch up from finding my head on Sylvia, her arms still wrapped around me like I&apos;m a pillow.</p>
<p>&emsp;I quickly draw the phone to my ear. &quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus, it&apos;s Clint,&quot; he says, scrambling for breath. &quot;The storehouse is burning! Damn vandals . . . arsonists . . . Guard with their questions . . . Get down here, now!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel my heart rise into my throat. I leave Sylvia still dreaming, no longer flinching from hours of our peaceful, drunken sleep.</p>

<p>&emsp;1&quot;It wasn&apos;t me, son, I swear &mdash; why would I burn my own property?&quot; Clint says. His head sinks in his hands. A handprint of ash drags across his cheeks. &quot;But these bastards think they knew what they saw.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, what did you see?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I only caught a flash of it. There&apos;s been a couple of &apos;em, out late during darktime, who&apos;ve been tryin&apos; the locks at the storehouse and I yell &apos;em off&mdash; early this morning they broke the locks and made it in. Went over to call &apos;em out, but I only caught a glimpse of them as they left, wearing city guards&apos; gear, just as the whole place lit up. You have to tell them, son, they won&apos;t listen to me,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You sure?&quot; I say. &quot;Because the last time I checked, Everett had that place insured, and . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint yanks the throat of my collar to his face. &quot;And you think I&apos;m lying about it? You think I&apos;m that low, son?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Two weeks before Everett&apos;s insurance was supposed to expire on the place, and we&apos;d have to pay for renewal, I saw the letters in the mail,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it wouldn&apos;t sell before, no matter how hard Everett tried,&quot; I say, &quot;you remember?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I&apos;d never do that, son,&quot; Clint says. The anger dissolves from his eyes, traded for the rare complexion of weakness or grief. I find myself believing him. &quot;I&apos;ll do anything to protect you and Ellie, anything within the bounds of the law. In fact, it&apos;s not even mine anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The surprise short-circuits my mind. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You . . . you fucking sold it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;In the best interest of our family,&quot; he says. &quot;The deal was just about to go through &mdash; I let them visit to unload their things early.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I told you. I told you not to do that. Never! Not for this pathetic sinkhole of a shop! Are you kidding me?&quot; I yell. Others start to glare.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, it wasn&apos;t willed to you, you stubborn prick. It was willed to me! Everett. My father &mdash;&quot; His words trail off: thoughts unable to hold weight, so they float into the air, just as the city guards approach.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll have to take you in for some questioning since you&apos;re a person of interest,&quot; they say.</p>
<p>&emsp;Anger and sadness clash in his mind until a single emotion wins over. He lifts himself to his feet, and I&apos;m reminded of how scrawny he&apos;s become since his days as a guard: hardly eating, just enough to keep the shop running, just to stoke the continuous dream. &quot;Alright,&quot; he mutters. &quot;But you&apos;ll get nothing. Nothing! Years serving this city, and when I retire, all you do is forget and screw me over!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The scene clears out after half an hour. Clean-up crews still sort through the wreckage: it looks as if someone dumped a large bag of charcoal in a warehouse-sized firepit. And for the first time in years, not a single light glows in the window of Clint&apos;s shop&mdash;not in the reflection of the trinkets, not the military surplus gear, nor the shimmer from his reading spectacles when he does some accounting at the lonely desk facing the window.</p>
<p>&emsp;The news filters through slow as molasses throughout the day, and observations bleed in crimson ink across the headlines. It began as reports on the burning of the property: the smoldering blaze that lasted for hours. City patrol said the fire started from inside the property, from a room in the basement, spreading outwards until the warehouse collapsed on itself like a house of cards, and the descending flurries of snow were no match for it. The cold gusts of air had naught a chance to put it out either &mdash; and it was left in ashen ruins until evening before crews sorted through the rubble.</p>
<p>&emsp;It was then and only then that the source of the fire was discovered, along with the bodies, charred black to a crisp as if the Chymaerans had sucked the life from them, but scalding burns alone weren&apos;t the only abuse these bodies had taken, stab wounds so deep the fusing of flesh in the combustion failed to mend their skin together, some entry wounds so deep they penetrated all the way through the bodies.</p>
<p>&emsp;The cadavers&apos; clothes were entirely singed off, but the metallic melted plates fused on their shoulders, and it was this fact alone that revealed their identity. The same plates I wore when I was an early cadet in their combat training schools. The same plates Romin wore to the academy sometimes when a &quot;family job&quot; ran long and went all night, it was the symbol of the Carmine: the same insignia proudly worn by nearly ten percent of Blackwater (or those courageous enough to show their colors in public.) It isn&apos;t until the morning after that Romin&apos;s tirade explains the rest.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Those sons of bitches! I told them it was a setup,&quot; Romin shouts. &quot;Those Vermillion bastards killed them . . . &quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;The Carmine compound swarms with activity. They&apos;re armed for war. Caches of weapons are brandished from their crates and the courtyards flood with faces I&apos;ve never seen, every able-bodied soldier coaxed from the woodwork. If there&apos;s one thing our city is good at, it&apos;s spreading news like wildfire&mdash;where daily news drops like the Firebrands beyond the walls.</p>
<p>&emsp;And the only reason this all happens, the only reason it&apos;s possible for the Carmine to get in? Because they own the place. And they were only kids. Kids of the Carmine officers who were unloading boxes for allowance money.</p>
<p>&emsp;My father sold the damn place behind my back and didn&apos;t even tell me about it, which cuts me deeper than the possibility of it being insurance fraud in the first place. After extensive interrogation, he was absolved of being a suspect of the crime. And he can&apos;t sink any lower in the list of people I don&apos;t trust, even lower than Romin hiding cards under the table when we gamble for money on the weekends.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They were kids, Titus! I saw them just yesterday, I swear. Imagine, just imagine... imagine if that was Ellie in there, dead, all for nothing, not even seizing any of our product, all just for murder, all for blood, all just to send a damn message or, I don&apos;t know, just to . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin. Just think about this for a minute before you do something you&apos;ll regret.&quot; He appears almost twice as big when he&apos;s angry and agreeing with him might exacerbate his livid anger. &quot;Why would the Merlot do this?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because it was them! Their gear. Their foot soldiers left it in the wreckage.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But what would even trigger this?&quot; I ask. &quot;Think, Romin, what reason would they have? You understand people better than I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin scoffs. His fists clench in tight boulders. &quot;So a setup? Who else than the Merlot would dare try to stop us? They&apos;ve had it out for us ever since we decided to protect the people and resist against their draconian bloody laws.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It just doesn&apos;t feel right,&quot; I tell him, but his anger eclipses any hope of sensibility in his mind: it&apos;s a natural state for him, and after years of skirmishes with the Merlot, their entire brotherhood is far from forgiveness. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We need more bombings to show them who really runs the city. Shoot first, ask questions later&mdash;give the enemy some dead to mourn before we talk,&quot; Romin says.</p>
<p>&emsp;Only my father and grandfather remember the riots from before I was born. Five percent of the properties in the city were reduced to ashes. It was only several leaders&apos; houses that they targeted, but the perfect conditions of wind and heat erupted it into a full firestorm. Shattered glass from the looting scattered across the streets, and there was so much property damage that the entire city shut down for two weeks just to try and recuperate the losses.</p>
<p>&emsp;I hope nothing rash will come from this burning. But the Carmine are too proud of a people, and so many swarmed the compound with such a strong groupthink it will only take minutes before their rage destroys any chance at dialogue.</p>
<p>&emsp;Sometimes days stretch on for lifetimes. And in rare moments of chaos like these, sometimes a life&apos;s-worth of action takes place in the space of hours. And regardless of the rage of the Carmine, there&apos;s one piece of news that still bothers me.</p>
<p>&emsp;The Academy is determined as the safest place for Firebrands and their families. So many accumulate in the District Twelve square: medical tents once purposed for combat trials used to tend to the grievously injured; faction-aligned Cadets arguing and throwing fists to speak for their anger; authority sheepish and cowardly, unable to suppress the anarchy; but it&apos;s not just us. Not just District Twelve.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The entire city of Blackwater is now under a forced curfew,&quot; a speaker repeats above their heads. &quot;Report to your homes or the nearest safe-designated facility.&quot; It wasn&apos;t just the trade house. I might believe it was the first, but at the same time, hundreds of Carmine properties were set ablaze, traces of Merlot gear singed in the wreckage, and I wonder how they could possibly be so careless to leave it behind.</p>
<p>&emsp;But I&apos;m not at the Academy. Through streets of soot and smoke I tread onwards, dodging masses of black-covered instigators and homeless and Outwaller desperates getting in on the anarchy, sure to cover any ties to either faction.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s sick,&quot; Clint says. He&apos;s home for the first time in ages. Ellie sits on the couch. She looks sick and pale, sweating profusely, the veins of her flesh almost looking amethyst under the faint light.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Chymaeran Curse. Like Everett,&quot; Clint says, but he&apos;s wrong. I spent years studying the Chymaerans. I&apos;ve spent just as long looking over Sylvia&apos;s shoulder at the medical books.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Not the Curse. This is something I&apos;ve never seen before.&quot; Ellie doesn&apos;t cry or scream. She just sits there, immobile, as if the joints in her bones have been fused together, drawing labored breaths, extinguished of her young energy, and my father and I panic over what to do next.</p>

<p>&emsp;The Carmine might have sparked the riots, but the city&apos;s anger burns on the fuel of a hundred years of poverty. Inequality bounded the Outwallers on the far edges of the city, fighting to survive their frozen landscapes without the warmth of the inner lands. Now they act out their livid frustrations as if destruction could recuperate even a tenth of their horrible lives.</p>
<p>&emsp;Beyond the walls of this house, I can hear none of it. My heartbeat pulses in my ears. My hands fumble over her, and I curse myself for the lack of knowledge that could save her and bring her back to health. Never have I seen this before in all my years&mdash;in none of the Frosthards beyond the walls that succumbed to Chymaeran attacks; any of the Academy footage and research; not in anything.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ellie. Ellie,&quot; I repeat, over and over. Her flesh is ice, the circumstances inexplicable. There&apos;s nothing within her to possibly make her this sick, and the fear of losing her only makes my hands shake harder.</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint sits beside her. He cradles her frail form in his arms as if the warmth of his body can bring her back, and I can see a restless regret grow in his eyes. He left his shop at the first word of the chaos, returning back to our home for the first time in months, and he found her sprawled out across the floor, incapable of speech and of little motion.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And this is how you found her?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot; Clint&apos;s words are short. &quot;The caretakers should have dropped her off two hours before I arrived. The nanny never came.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Damn it! I should have been here. I should have been here,&quot; I say, and Clint turns to offer a word of reassurance, but my mind races. All I can think of is every lecture I&apos;ve ever had. Obsidian skin covers the Chymaera. The Chymaeran Curse leaves the veins Amethyst. Only in the presence of strong Chymaeran energy can this happen, but why can&apos;t I feel it? Or Clint?</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Was the door unlocked when you came in?&quot; I ask him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It was,&quot; he replies, &quot;but you know how Ellie forgets to lock doors. It could have been the caretakers.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Panicked, I rise my feet. All the energy I have with nothing intelligent to do drives me towards anything. &quot;And you found her here?&quot; I ask him. </p>
<p>&emsp;He nods.</p>
<p>&emsp;I inspect the floor, but nothing stands out to me: I know nothing of what we&apos;re up against. Merlot suspected of raids on the Carmine. The city in flames, looting, anarchy, but how could the Chymaera influence an internal dispute, when they&apos;re far beyond the walls?</p>
<p>&emsp;Just then an energy feathers in the air, carrying a scent of ozone I&apos;ve only noticed miles outside the city. </p>
<p>&emsp;Clint jumps. &quot;No, no, no, stop!&quot; he shouts, and I approach them, only to witness the amethyst spreading faster. </p>
<p>&emsp;She shivers in her sweat.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ellie! You&apos;re fine, you&apos;re alright,&quot; Clint reassures her. With nothing I can do, all I can muster is to lean over the couch and helplessly watch. I can feel the invisible source of danger approaching closer, a certain energy that vibrates every particle of my very existence, resonating with the meager essence in my circuits.</p>
<p>&emsp;The door bursts open, and before either Clint or I can turn around, the intruders announce themselves.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Child Services. We&apos;re taking your daughter to a place where she belongs.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I take in my first glimpse of them: dressed in the sharply-woven threads of Merlotan civil servants, pinkish-red and gold adorned in the accents of their clothing. My teeth nearly chatter when the darktime winds blow in from the street.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;On whose bloody-damn authority?&quot; I ask. </p>
<p>&emsp;And then I think of all the forms Clint pushed on me. Only one person could be responsible for this: the only one who&apos;s passively aware without helping at all.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint, you Gods-damn bastard!&quot; I shout. &quot;You&apos;re the reason they&apos;re here!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I swear to the Gods, Titus,&quot; he says. Holding Ellie, he crumples in what seems like a genuine state of panic, but his lies are always far too convincing.</p>
<p>&emsp;There&apos;s four of them. They circle us, and my breath parts in fading clouds. I consider the door behind us is open, but when I turn to look, I realize it has already been shut.</p>
<p>&emsp;The first dark-haired civil servant drags his finger across the counter. Dust collects between them. And another of them sneezes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Despicable living conditions,&quot; he says. &quot;Hours spent alone without family, and now your daughter is sick from the cold. We&apos;ve received an endless string of reports.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Like fridging hell you have,&quot; I say. My hands tension to fists, and Clint grows defensive like a cornered rabbit as they approach. &quot;From who?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;From Eliza&apos;s teacher, at the Academy. You didn&apos;t think the girl was smart enough to reach out to a real force of reliable authority?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The four social service members approach as Ellie&apos;s condition worsens, and though I open my mouth, Clint speaks first.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You Merlot home-wreckers aren&apos;t allowed to show up without a notice,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;ve sent nothing!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ve sent more than nothing. Three letters, to be exact.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint turns to me, but I beat him to the punch this time. &quot;They&apos;re lying. Not a single letter, not anything, has come to us.&quot; But his face says that he still doesn&apos;t believe me. &quot;Oh, I&apos;m sorry, should I just redirect all the mail to your shop since you practically live there now?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You could try, Titus, just a little bit harder to care for your family!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, when I raise this young girl and you won&apos;t even see her? You haven&apos;t stepped foot in this house in three months!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Three months?&quot; The case worker exclaims. Clint&apos;s face screws up further when we realize I&apos;ve only stirred the pot. &quot;Gods! Poor child.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s coming with us immediately,&quot; the two surrounding my father say. &quot;Give her up. Now.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Over my dead body,&quot; Clint says, but I feel a sickness in my stomach over how all of this adds up. During the riots, at darktime? And not only that, but&mdash;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Who made these reports?&quot; I ask again. I can feel this exchange feathering that line between talk and brutal action, and so I circle left to the fireplace, feeling for cold iron.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Academy teacher.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s my sister&apos;s name again?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;They stumble for answers. &quot;We don&apos;t know all the details. We&apos;re just case workers.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Her name is Ellie. And she goes to Seminary, not the Academy.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I give them a chance to react. At the sight of me brandishing the spade and poker, normal Merlotan desk-jockeys might cower and run or call for backup: not even close to worth their minimum-wage jobs.</p>
<p>&emsp;But their expressions are hauntingly stoic and unmoved, and my heart jumps when I realize the improbable is real. Before the surprise is dead, I take a hard swing with the spade against the back of one intruder, and I&apos;m surprised when I don&apos;t connect with the bones of the spine.</p>
<p>&emsp;But it still keels them over, and they cry out in anguish. Three still stand: one to the left and two to the right, reaching within their coats to pull something a true social worker should never have. I take the spade by the butt edge and feel the weight of it, more unbalanced a tool like a hatchet than the poker, and so I swing it out in a full arc, the sharp edge driven perfectly against the breastbone of the left intruder after two clean spins. But like the last, there&apos;s no clang of hardness when it connects. </p>
<p>&emsp;The two right intruders now brandish iron that shoots, and my mind flips to the rifle Clint stores beneath the bootlegger&apos;s hatch in the kitchen. Too far to reach, I realize, and as I duck for cover behind the couch, Clint rushes up to bash one of the gunman at close range.</p>
<p>&emsp;The rounds blast through the couch fabric. Our ears ring in close quarters. They won&apos;t shoot Ellie because, for some reason, she&apos;s their reason to be here, so I pilfer an unconscious intruder for the hardware they were packing.</p>
<p>&emsp;My training reacts before I can. I cock the hammer of the five-round revolver and scope in beneath the couch: Clint&apos;s boots and a stranger&apos;s pop up and down like the generators&apos; pistons in their tangle. My finger hinges once and the revolver jumps. Something bluer than blood blood sprays against the wall, and the non-brandishing bastard fighting my father yelps for a second.</p>
<p>&emsp;He falls to the ground, and I take a second shot. It digs into the intruder&apos;s shoulder. Clint&apos;s able to overpower him now, but I can visualize the other trigger-happy intruder turning to blast him, so I reach to peek my head above the couch with the handgun. I feel something freezing cold strangle my ankle before I can shoot, and it forces me backwards towards the fireplace. The gun slips from my hand. My head bashes against the brick and fireworks light behind my eyes, while Clint tussles with the bloody bastard on the ground as the other gunman waits for a shot. </p>
<p>&emsp;It comes to me when I turn back to look at the first one I bashed with the spade, purple blood, darkening flesh like a melting black-wax idol, their true identity made, but it&apos;s too late for the information to be useful.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint, they&apos;re Chymaerans!&quot; I shout.</p>
<p>&emsp;That pricey fireplace set mom bought years ago cost extra for three tools instead of two, and I bet Clint would retract his complaining if he saw me reaching for the tongs. The Chymaeran&apos;s grasp is still strong as death and cold as ice. The tongs leap from their hook but fall into the fire, handle-first, and the more I reach, the more I feel a pin-and-needle stabbing pain climb my leg.</p>
<p>&emsp;Something hard clatters against the floor on the other side of the foyer, and I realize it&apos;s the other gunman&apos;s revolver. They fight hand-to-hand now, and as I reach further, inching my fingers just a little bit more, I feel them reach just enough to wrap around the inside edge of the bent metal. The iron is hot. The other end is scalding red, and when I whip it around to strike in and sizzle the Chymaeran&apos;s flesh, I feel the stabbing pain withdraw.</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint still fights with the fourth one, and now that the Chymaerans are exposed for what they really are, no holds barred, I can see Clint&apos;s adversary smirk with a twisted grin. Something changes in the attacker&apos;s right arm, reforming to something slender, obsidian, and black. My struggling father doesn&apos;t notice, and it&apos;s far too late to react, though my hands still clasp around the gun.</p>
<p>&emsp;The slender limb stabs through my father&apos;s chest and he gasps for air, unable to scream. And then it slices again, severing my father&apos;s arm in a swift draw.</p>
<p>&emsp;His blood mixes with the purple ooze dyed into the carpet, and when he collapses, choking on the blood saturated in his punctured lung with only one arm to brace it, the crimson trickles down his chin.</p>
<p>&emsp;Furious, I raise myself to shoot, but my body freezes on a sudden gust of chilling winds. </p>
<p>&emsp;The door is open again. </p>
<p>&emsp;A fifth figure with no disguise has already entered, dressed in a black-hooded cloak. I can feel the strength of their Essence. My blood runs from fluid to molasses to ice, and it feels as if the push-pull command of all my muscles fire at once in perfect balance, my finger hinged around the trigger, trapped in that scarce moment before deliverance.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Fridging hell, you two really did a number on them,&quot; a male voice says. &quot;If I wasn&apos;t here, you probably could have made off with her.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint sprawls across the carpet I once played on, as still as I am, his wounds cauterized in this moment by solid blood. Neither of us can manage words, but just watch, as the tall stranger passes the dead Chymaerans, walking directly past the path of my gun.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But if you left, you wouldn&apos;t have anywhere to run. Those shitblood Frosthards and Outwallers both freeze the same &mdash; the only difference is what side of the wall they&apos;re on.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I can feel every cell of my body scream for oxygen: so still I can&apos;t even feel my own heart. I wonder if it still beats in my chest, and whether by fortune or folly my eyes still fix on my dying father. Both him and his attacker are stuck there like the miniatures from the war games Romin and I used to play as kids.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that he notices my line of sight. &quot;Whether you shoot him or not, your father is still going to die a horrible death.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;I can see the anger carved in the opposing Chymaeran&apos;s face, stabbing arms suspended above my father&apos;s heart, trapped in a scene much like the bronzework of the Academy halls.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Shoot him or don&apos;t. Either way you&apos;ll weep over your father. These failures are useless to me every time I send them in,&quot; he says, and he lifts Ellie in his arms. &quot;I&apos;m taking her to a place where she&apos;ll have greater purpose than you or your father can ever give her.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I fight my arms so tenaciously to bend, just a little, to turn the muzzle toward her nihilistic captor, but he&apos;s already reached the door with my sister. As soon as the door slams, I feel my body gasp for air, my pointer finger hinge instinctively around the trigger, and the skull-matter of the Chymaeran spray black tar across Moira&apos;s floral wallpaper.</p>
<p>&emsp;The further the stranger and my sister slip away from the bloodstained room, the faster my father&apos;s stump un-cauterizes, spilling his life even further in a puddle across the floors and all the sheet-covered upholstery.</p>
<p>&emsp;His eyes turn upwards, but he has no words for me, staring somewhere else far beyond this world, as if he can see the woman behind the portrait he&apos;s drank to on so many late nights. I curse myself in regret over that last act of hubris in the lofts &mdash; slamming that door shut just as he mustered the courage to share his feelings with me &mdash; and I feel the penetrating saturation of self-hate overtake me with every labored breath. The guilt and regrets seize the words in my throat, but his gaze is suddenly serene, and directed right at me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m covered in my father&apos;s blood. I try to do something&mdash;anything&mdash;as the oxygen slowly returns to my pin-and-needle atrophied muscles. My heart pulses, driving the elixir of life through my veins that leaves Clint by the buckets, and I refuse to accept the brutal fact that there&apos;s nothing I can do to save him.</p>
<p>&emsp;He watches me panic. He watches me cry, and I feel his red-caked arm weakly grasping my trembling wrist: soft, and I can feel the last moments of his life transferred through the heat.</p>
<p>&emsp;My first words are the last he&apos;ll hear, and I stumble over them. Apologies. Regrets. The pain of guilt and the irreversibility of how I caused this. I hate myself because I can never be enough, not to anyone, and I abhor that bitter weakness that follows. But the serene look in his eyes gives me pause &mdash; a look of forgiveness, of absolute fatherly love no longer inhibited by his fears and resentment, and then I remember all the best times of my childhood that I repressed, the pride in his eyes, the weight of my light body on his shoulders, the beauty of everything before the blemish in our history that divided us.</p>
<p>&emsp;I still can&apos;t cry as his eyes glaze over, pointed upwards like forgotten glass marbles fixed to the ceiling by an invisible thread, the lightest grasp of his hand on my shoulder weakening as his body runs dry.</p>
<p>&emsp;He finally returned home in the end. Now I pray the Gods will take him to the woman he missed for so long. The only thing that burns brighter now than the self-hatred is another force that drags me even further: the liquid heat of revenge and retribution that only I can deliver alone.</p>
<p>&emsp;The siren wails in the distance, late to answer, and the motif of three shrill tones confirm the terror of what I&apos;ve witnessed.</p>
<p>&emsp;The Chymaerans have breached the walls.</p>

<p>&emsp;The Vermillion estate glistens rose gold on the paydirt of the foothills. Its overly luscious landscapes of bright manicured grass, saturated with antiques of past ages and a staff of so many groundskeepers it could be mistaken as a small village, fails to captivate my attention the way their lascivious ways intend.</p>
<p>&emsp;The highest echelon cadets were sent to the foothills to defend the Merlot against the rage of the Carmine. The only chance at free will I had was to sign on for the Vermillion estate, though I knew Romin wouldn&apos;t be here &mdash; gods know where his rage leads him now.</p>
<p>&emsp;My eyes don&apos;t scan for faces the way the other cadets do. I can only look within myself &mdash; and wonder why emotion fails to twist my stomach or draw tears from my eyes. As panic and anxiety exchange for the long exhaustion of what those emotions cost, I find no catharsis, but that doesn&apos;t surprise me.</p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia and I find ourselves at the heavily-guarded front door. Mercenaries in pink fill the fields like flowers. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m asking where Valentina is. Valentina Vermillion?&quot; I ask, but the guards are oblivious, as if they refuse to recognize her. </p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia and I soon give up, descending the marble steps of the front entry way. Several dozen cadets meander in the grass, either lost or anxiously awaiting further orders.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe it&apos;s a safety thing,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;I can&apos;t think of why else they wouldn&apos;t identify her. We&apos;re only here to protect the head families of the Merlot.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then why is Vera out there?&quot; I point to the well-manicured lawn of verdant grass, bounded by sentries standing at the edges of the metal-barred walls. Vera stands with her full fireteam while we still can&apos;t account for half of ours. Scattered around, the Academy captains stand in as makeshift generals, disseminating commands from higher powers, reminding us of the sanctity of our cause &mdash; defending the Afterlife. Sylvia and I listen in as we head for Vera.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But what about our families? What about the people below?&quot; voices ask, rendered anonymous by the size of the crowd. But they ring out, unanswered.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You will not be here for long, two days at the maximum. The riots are still active, the worst this city has ever seen. Our leaders fear the anger directed at the Merlot and the Afterlife, led by Carmine terrorists,&quot; the Captain says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then why are there so many reports of Chymaerans?&quot; another asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There are no Chymaerans!&quot; the Captain replies. &quot;The Chymaerans are weak. How could they ever breach our walls?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I turn to Sylvia. &quot;I know for certain that they were Chymaerans. Wearing all black. No other faction or agency wears that,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You still haven&apos;t told me what happened,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not important right now,&quot; I say. The endless thoughts have been setting me on edge since the incident, but I guess I&apos;ve done well to hide it. I should panic about Ellie. I should be haunted by the face of my father and the last words he spoke to me, but it&apos;s not a priority.</p>
<p>&emsp;We approach Vera. She reveals all she has heard from Merlotan informants. I grab Vera&apos;s attention between a pause of her speech. &quot;Have there been reports of any other factions&apos; involvement?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;As in neither Merlot or Carmine? Not that I&apos;ve heard of,&quot; Vera says. &quot;All that we know is this issue&apos;s far more severe than we anticipated. And what&apos;s weird? Carmine and Merlot forces alone can&apos;t even equate to all the destruction in the city below.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well there&apos;s a lot of Outwallers. What, forty percent of the population?&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But all of them at once? Most are too uneducated to even read the signs they&apos;d be holding,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;They&apos;re too focused on poverty to understand the depth of Blackwater politics.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And where&apos;s Valentina?&quot; Sylvia interjects.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s here,&quot; Vera says. &quot;She&apos;s in her room, I believe. Do you know where it is?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The guards won&apos;t let us enter, let alone even talk to them,&quot; Sylvia says. But I still want Vera to answer my question. I want to know everything of my sister&apos;s captors. And I know the Chymaera are a part of all of this.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She doesn&apos;t live in the house,&quot; Vera says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean, then?&quot; Sylvia asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So you really don&apos;t know? She hasn&apos;t told you . . . well, of course.&quot; Vera points to a shoddy stone building beside the house. &quot;Check in there.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Is that a . . . shed? Why would she be in there?&quot; Sylvia asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just look,&quot; Lyra says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I speak in a hushed tone when Sylvia walks towards the shed. &quot;The factions, back to that question, is there any other activity? The group that kidnapped my sister&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus, Titus, Titus! I don&apos;t have all the answers,&quot; Vera interjects, &quot;there&apos;s hundreds of missing people. Get in line with the rest of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She shoos us away. We make for the stone building in the corner of the estate, weaving through gardeners and handymen wearing Vermillion attire. It humors me sick to see the rich still care so much about petty appearances, though I have no room to laugh. The stone shed is a square edifice with cobwebs between the eaves and the walls, entirely unkempt, as if purposely neglected by the housekeepers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Fetching supplies? I couldn&apos;t see a woman like Valentina getting her hands dirty,&quot; I tell Sylvia.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She wouldn&apos;t step within a hundred feet of a building like this,&quot; Sylvia replies. We knock on the door. Boots clatter against uncarpeted floors. The door hesitantly opens, just a crack, and Valentina&apos;s face is flushed with embarrassment when she sees us.</p>
                                                                                                "},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":22,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":11,"ChapterFull":12,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":22,"Index":36,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"34","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Val&apos;s fa ade crashes.

<p>&emsp;Valentina always talks about her life in pompousness, from the clothes on her back to the jewelry on her wrists and fingers. It is a stark contrast to her room in the cellar. </p>
<p>&emsp;Yes. Her bedroom, in the cellar.</p>
<p>&emsp;Frigid stone walls hold spiderwebs tucked in the corners. The only color comes from the bright vermilion bed with the golden &apos;V&apos; crest on the headboard, swallowing all the color from the room, as if transplanted there like a fresh heart into the chest of a dying body.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They just moved me here. But it&apos;s temporary, since I&apos;m away for a while,&quot; Valentina says. Clothes scatter across the ground in a disheveled mess, with a sea of so many hats I lose count of all the peaks. Every day she wears one. Now I finally see how many she really has.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just temporary. Father&apos;s working on upgrading my room to celebrate graduation.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia and I watch her. She knows the disbelief is beginning to overtake us.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Painters. Designers. Maids, you know,&quot; Valentina says. She&apos;s a good actor and a better liar&mdash; but now, she lacks the energy to carry her image.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just temporary. And . . . Gods, I can&apos;t take it anymore!&quot; She bursts into tears, grasping at her cramped stomach with manicured claws as if her lies have finally come to infect her. She dabs her eyes with a crimson scarf, and I begin to put the pieces together: that jealous glare that always consumed her when her sister Vera was around; their competition over appearance. But now, all that remains is a hollow thousand-yard stare that traces through all her memories of loneliness and shame.</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m at a loss for words&mdash;just to say something that wouldn&apos;t shatter her pride further. Envelopes stack on the dresser, dated for each week, stamped with the title WEEKLY GUEST PROVISIONS, half of them still unopened, addressed to just &quot;Valentina&quot; with the last name excerpted from their covers. Just the fact that this basement was entirely separated from the main house was enough to feel so perverse, the tension of some insidious hatred that Val buried for years.</p>
<p>&emsp;The dam crumbles, and the truth pours out, a discomfort she&apos;s hidden for years without telling us. I wonder if Romin knew anything of this.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;ve been cut off for the last three years?&quot; Sylvia asks. &quot;What do you mean? Why didn&apos;t you tell us?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because if the truth got out, then I&apos;d be severed for good,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;It was only four years ago that my mother found out the truth, thinking I was adopted from another branch of our family. She took me in so lovingly all those years. That damn letter . . .&quot; she says, voice shaking. &quot;That damn letter from my estranged mother, and I wonder if my father even tried to hide it. Does he really care? Does he ever even stand up for me against her, that vile bitch? Gods, it&apos;s not my fault for being born!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The strength of Valentina&apos;s words escapes her. Sylvia speaks her name, trying to soothe her with her voice.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I wasn&apos;t the best daughter either, you know,&quot; she says. &quot;You know, I think I just asked too much, too stuck-up, so I don&apos;t think she was wrong, there was just always this feeling of guilt that came over me again and again, and, and&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;Val, Val. Don&apos;t think for a second&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;-and, and Father would just stand there every time she&apos;d say all those things, and I&apos;d wait for him to cut in, I&apos;d wait for him to say it was all wrong but he&apos;d turn his eyes from me, and Sister would stay away from us until Mother ran out of words to pour her anger . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But you&apos;re here!&quot; I say, &quot;You&apos;re with us, here, and&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m a mistake. I was never meant to be born in this world,&quot; she cries.</p>
<p>&emsp;The reverberations of distant catastrophe echo through the cellar, bringing out the most delicate parts within each of us. I feel the vulnerable part of myself strangled by the hands of a distant pain, something I can&apos;t release, even though Sylvia so freely voices her own feelings of pain. Sylvia sits next to her, but I can&apos;t understand. I don&apos;t know what to do. I feel so uncomfortable, not knowing what to say, still so stuck in my recent past that empathy is unreachable.</p>
<p>&emsp;I just stand there. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Have you ever wanted to meet her?&quot; Sylvia says, trying to derail her train of thoughts.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Her? My mother?&quot; Valentina asked.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Your real mother. I&apos;m sure she loves you so deeply.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s the one thought that&apos;s always held me here,&quot; she whispers, reclining on the bed as Sylvia lays next to her. &quot;If that one day I&apos;d just worn a hat like always . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Sylvia asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The shame. The physical representation of my father&apos;s sin. Proof that there&apos;s such a big world out there hidden from all of us, of other peoples and other allegiances. The secret I&apos;ve hidden since long before we first met, always there just to remind me of my dirty blood.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus and I are always open if you want to tell us,&quot; she whispers. I nod, unable to play the right notes to match the melody of the moment.</p>
<p>&emsp;She purses her lips, sucking the bright red from the sparkling lip gloss caked across them, and the words teeter on the edge of her lips. </p>
<p>&emsp;But it&apos;s more an action than a sentence. </p>
<p>&emsp;Her hand reaches for the top of her hat. &quot;My mother was a stop on that trip that Daddy took to the other lands. He never expected me to be born, never wanted me to be born. And one day he learned that I was alive. He came back to get me: not from a place of love, but a place of fear, afraid of his reputation, of how it might affect him if he didn&apos;t silence the truth. I still remember that day he gave me a hat. He told me to wear it forever, because it was lucky, because it was our secret, and&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She pulls the hat away, and the sight speaks volumes on its own. </p>
<p>&emsp;Twitching blond peaks dial to the sounds of the room. My memory flashes to Everett&apos;s tales from my early childhood: the folk tales, and the word AHKVASAN is the first realization that crosses my mind. </p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m in awe. The blonde peaks of her ears softly twitch at the deep intonation of my voice.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s incredible!&quot; I say. The words escape before I can stop them. Sylvia jumps. Valentina still tenses in anticipation of our reactions, but slowly loosens, and I know she couldn&apos;t ever conceive of my response. &quot;That&apos;s incredible, are you kidding me? All these years of Everett&apos;s stories, and all those fairy tales, the Carmine, me thinking he was crazy saying it was all real, and . . .&quot; I laugh, too elated to speak.</p>
<p>&emsp;She blushes. For the first time in days, I watched her crack a smile as she began to laugh, too, and soon the entire chamber echoes with laughter until she is crying tears in good humor.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I love you even more now, if I didn&apos;t already love you before,&quot; Sylvia says, as Valentina gains the light of a realization she&apos;s missed for far too long.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve lived my whole life afraid of myself. Now that I&apos;m no longer silenced by the threat of being severed from this family, everything feels a little bit lighter,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;I haven&apos;t stopped thinking about your speech at graduation, Titus, and I know those words came from your soul. We have to let go. Of everything. Of all that pain and feel into it.&quot; </p>
It hurts to know the words were nothing to me, just projections of a higher truth others wanted to hear. But if it can give her genuine strength, I find that&apos;s all that matters."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":3,"AutoNameFull":23,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":11,"ChapterFull":12,"ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":23,"Index":37,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"35","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Titus&apos; dream.","VerboseID":"2.12.23","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"BWZI","Body":"
<p>&emsp;We find a strange peace that night. While others camp outside in tents just beyond the property, the three of us remain inside the claustrophobic shed. Sylvia sleeps in the bed with Valentina. I sleep on a bed of hats to keep warm.</p>
<p>&emsp;The dreams grow stronger, and I&apos;m no longer plagued by the same recurring dream. I dream of the coldness of my father&apos;s figure, still sprawled across the floor somewhere in a pool of his own blood, his glance forever fixed beyond the door I left open. I can feel the regret of his thoughts. From miles away I can sense his soul still wandering the halls of that house he tried to forget, forever waking to open the door of my sister&apos;s room to find she&apos;s been lost. The depth of the red puddle grows. It catches my ankles as I stand over him, and as if it were stretching the edge of a deep lake, I fall into it, unable to paddle.</p>
<p>&emsp;I suffocate in his crimson shadow.</p>
<p>&emsp;I thrash for minutes until I&apos;m deprived of energy. My lungs scream for air, but I will my mouth shut. Though oxygen is extinguished, I find that they don&apos;t burn.</p>
<p>&emsp;I open my eyes to find the water is deep cobalt. There&apos;s no shimmering crest where the water touches the sky, and I feel the pressure of depth without a light to bring me back. There is only a lantern in my hand, its beacon only strong enough to light an arm&apos;s length ahead, and around me, charcoal black stalagmites stab from gravel sedimentation.</p>
<p>&emsp;The only sensation of touch is something bound to my wrist&mdash;a thread, thin but unbreakable, tensioned to something far beyond the murky depths, and it drags me between the obsidian rocks. A deep acoustic vibration reverberates through the water. I&apos;m being pulled faster. And the louder it gets, the stronger the black statues harmonize. Statues, not stalagmites: the further I go, the more the geometry diminishes in its abstraction, like unfinished sculptures the artist quit after chiseling a general form. I&apos;m dragged faster. The thread digs further into my wrist, stitching my forearm higher and higher, tensioning until I can feel my pulse, but all I can watch are the figures&mdash;so real now, so lifelike&mdash;and they&apos;re no longer trapped to the curse of their rigid medium.</p>
<p>&emsp;Their arms are reaching for me, still too slow. It&apos;s as if I&apos;m watching evolution in a matter of seconds. Their surfaces so impossibly smooth as if sanded for thousands of years by the persistence of the water, grasping as if I&apos;m the only source of motion that can save them from the darkness.</p>
I can feel them touch with their cold, brutal forms, pleading: their voices now audible, and now I know the source of those vibrations that were once so far away. But the thread doesn&apos;t allow me to stop, to do anything. It drags me, onward, until the tension is unbearable, until the drag of the water is so strong I feel as if my arm will sever, and I can feel myself passing out, unable to hold on to consciousness while the thread stitches my entire arm, and so I let go."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Endogeny","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Twelve","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Thirteen","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":12,"ChapterFull":13,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":38,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"36","Synopsis":"The party discovers a sinister Chymaeran agent.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.13","Links":{"Wattpad":"https://www.wattpad.com/user/SavantGuarde","Personal":"https://autononymous.io/authors-and-stories/savantguarde/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand/firebrand-1-12","RoyalRoad":"https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/109661/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand-book-one","AO3":"https://archiveofourown.org/works/63835228/chapters/164388721","DeviantArt":"https://www.deviantart.com/savant-guarde"},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

<p>&emsp;I awake to Valentina, her face flushed with panic, staring beyond the grated cellar window at the commotion. Her ears twitch as she trembles, focus attuned to something indiscernible. </p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia is still asleep. It&apos;s only several hours that we&apos;ve been out. We slept so peacefully with no anticipation: though it&apos;s anger that fuels the lower riots, most Firebrands believe our orders to be a temporary endeavor. Even my own mind begins to slip over the possibility of the Chymaerans breaching the city. Had it all been a hallucination? Was it some other external force that took my sister away? I know for sure they weren&apos;t Merlot or Carmine mercenaries, as they were draped in all black.</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m still uncertain of when I&apos;ll tell them. I don&apos;t think I will. All my fears are just a drop in the sea of anxious faces &mdash; that all of Blackwater is far too deep to surface from.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus,&quot; she whispers, &quot;are you awake?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. What?&quot; I ask. </p>
<p>&emsp;She motions for me to approach the window. &quot;Are the Firebrands supposed to leave their tents? There&apos;s a bunch of them walking around. The lights aren&apos;t even on in there anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Probably because they&apos;re all asleep,&quot; I say. But wait. No, they couldn&apos;t all be asleep. Some have to be on night watch. Although my eyes have already adjusted to the darkness, I struggle to determine what walks the grounds. It&apos;s as if the figures themselves are made of darkness. The lights are out. I begin to wonder if a quiet force swept through all the tents, when I hear a faint voice calling out to them.</p>
<p>&emsp;A sleepless Firebrand strides from the house to the lawn, and his voice piques with recognition. &quot;Erik. It&apos;s not your shift yet,&quot; he says. &quot;What are you doing up?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The other figure doesn&apos;t reply. I can&apos;t even see them from the frame of the thick stone window, though I can tell they&apos;re approaching.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Say something, you idiot,&quot; he says. &quot;Are you still giving me the silent treatment because I stole some of your rations? Whoa, Erik, what&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Silence. The Firebrand falls. Valentina gasps, covering her mouth. My heart skips a beat, and I step back, but something bothers me. I wasn&apos;t afraid by the severance of that cadet&apos;s speech, but the way he fell over. It didn&apos;t look as if anything had struck him. He didn&apos;t fall flat. He didn&apos;t crumple. His body didn&apos;t react in any way I expected, but rather as if it were amorphous, made of some tar-like substance. Memory of the term &quot;Black Bile&quot; flashes into my mind &mdash; a phrase Ellie&apos;s captors spoke before taking her. It&apos;s like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before, no way to explain it. And the unnatural silence falls on us once again before Valentina slams the window and rushes to lock everything separating this space from the outside world.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Up already?&quot; Sylvia mumbles, turning from her sleep. All she finds in us is the stillness of confusion, and I watch her heart jump into her throat.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What did we just see?&quot; Valentina asks. &quot;What was that . . . thing? That cadet was there and then he was gone before he could even finish his sentence.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It was fluid. He didn&apos;t bend or crumple, it&apos;s like he just . . . dissolved, or melted,&quot; Valentina says, and Sylvia sits there, confused, having expected nothing of our excursion to the Vermillion estate. &quot;But there&apos;s hundreds of cadets out there! How could it slip through all of them? Whatever this is&mdash;how couldn&apos;t they shout, not even one of them detect it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Just then, a shrill scream reverberates from somewhere beyond the walls. Inhuman. It reminds me of the bloodcurdling sound foxes make, almost like human voices, but just different enough to feel the fear of its distortion, and in that instant I&apos;m so thankful we decided to sleep here. We&apos;re safe. For now, though none of us know the adversary that surrounds us.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We need to get out of here,&quot; Sylvia says, gathering her things in a frenzied rush.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Absolutely not! We need to stay here. Until help arrives,&quot; Valentina insists. Or until lighttime, until we can tell what we&apos;re up against.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s everywhere. It&apos;s all around us, I can feel it,&quot; Sylvia says, &quot;can&apos;t you feel it? The smell of ozone?&quot; And then I notice the texture of the air. The smell of the Chymaera, of something foul and sickening growing stronger.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The lift. The lift,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;They said tomorrow, our family would be taking it to the upper lands. We just have to tough it out until then.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And you didn&apos;t tell us this before?&quot; I say. &quot;You all just expected to leave everyone behind. Let them all just die?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We couldn&apos;t expect anything like this! It was just until the riots were over. The Afterlife protects the Merlot. My family is their messengers, their enforcers, their distributors of nutrition and power.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Guys&mdash;&quot; Sylvia says, stopping our argument before it can start.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;How do we know this is affecting the whole city? What if this is what they wanted us to defend against, but we just didn&apos;t know it, they didn&apos;t tell us?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That doesn&apos;t matter. We need to get to that lift before it leaves,&quot; Sylvia says.</p>
<p>&emsp;Just then, a siren cracks the air. Flashing lights cast the landscape in blinding white, reflecting the snow as we watch beyond the southern windows. A slight incline affords us the smallest glimpse of the city. The iron gates are indiscernible. A black boulder rests where no earthly object stood before, and we see it between frames of strobe light like a silent picture. Now it&apos;s fluid. Pieces split from it. They grow arms. The masses evolve in seconds to whatever structure best suits them, and they rush towards the source of the sound.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods! Damn it!&quot; Valentina shouts, her voice drowned out by the droning of the siren, and in her betrayal, I realize what that sound represents. Her arms lash at the pieces of her wardrobe scattered across the floor. Sylvia and I do the same. Val seems uncertain of what she&apos;s looking for, until she struggles to lift a large metal grate from the floor. &quot;This is our only way out. Hurry. Those . . . bastards can&apos;t leave without us,&quot; she says, between breaths. My back cramps as we lift the heavy iron. Below is a drainage tunnel, a little large to drain such a small space. But considering the scandals of wealthy life and Lord Vermillion&apos;s taste for affairs, I don&apos;t question it.</p>
<p>&emsp;Valentina drops in. Her boots clatter against concrete, and instead of waiting for the three of us to replace the grate, she storms off, just as Sylvia inches herself below the ledge.</p>
<p>&emsp;I shout. &quot;Valentina, wait!&quot; but she&apos;s already disappeared into the darkness, and I jump straight in without grasping the sides. All I can hear is the echo of her frantic footfalls. I call for her, until breathing her name subtracts the air I need to sprint for her. Sylvia follows somewhere behind me. All that reverberates is the faint droning of the siren, growing louder as we approach. When darkness engulfs us, we fumble for the walls, and I hear the splash of her boots between bursts.</p>
<p>&emsp;A light crests the end of the tunnel, flashing, though too far away to distinguish any of our immediate obstacles. My breath tastes like poison. Sylvia grasps the back of my coat, asking nonverbally to lead her from this place.</p>
<p>&emsp;I call for her one last time before I make a blind dash. Physical obstructions can&apos;t stop me. All I can think of is losing a cherished friend beyond just Ellie and Clint, what terrible things might befall her, and after the death of my father, watching his soul squeezed from the narrow vessel of his body, the fear of losing others overrides the anxieties of my own life.</p>
<p>&emsp;I stumble over boulders and rocks and curse the uneven corridors. My knees and shins are shredded by shear stone, though Sylvia still follows behind me, almost keeping the same pace. I can see her silhouette. We&apos;re so close to the end. The flashing is brighter, it covers more of the tunnel, and I can see the faint stream of still wastewater glimmer, hear the weight of Valentina steps as she sets the water in disturbance.</p>
<p>&emsp;The sounds are deafening, echoing until the alarm is a droning scream. I reach out for her. My hand slips: a sting pierces my nerves when I realize my hands are sliced to hell, but I keep running. She&apos;s right there, and I can even hear her crying, sniffles between breaths as she chokes over mucus from crying and exhaustion.</p>
<p>&emsp;We&apos;re too late. </p>
<p>&emsp;The great trolley is reduced to the size of a fist in the distance, climbing the hill like a landslide in reverse. Four Vermillions peak from the railing, silhouetted by cabin light, and one smokes a cigar.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m still your daughter,&quot; Valentina whispers. She falls to her knees in the mud, face saturated in streaks of dirt as she watches her betrayal. Her exhaustion trades for helplessness, unable to find the motivation to take another step, now fully stripped of that identity she so reluctantly held to with a white-knuckle grasp.</p>
<p>&emsp;But whatever the tar is, and whatever form it takes, we can feel it approaching. The Merlot were never interested in saving Blackwater, nor in managing it. And for a moment I think I understand completely. They were only emissaries of the Afterlife because of a promise to be saved. But it only takes moments before I&apos;m proven wrong again.</p>
<p>&emsp;The shockwaves of a distant pop crest our eardrums before the hillside glows orange. Flaming refuse cascades from above. Screeching metal screams as it tears, obliterating the tracks, tearing like a caught hangnail ripping the flesh of the stark earth.</p>
<p>&emsp;Valentina&apos;s eyes glow jade green as she rises to her feet. I watch the wreckage reach a standstill, as if suspended in place, the fire no longer flickering, as if it were painted there with luminescent acrylic, unable to move. </p>
<p>&emsp;Humans have the powers of life and fire; Chymaerans of frost and death. But Ahkvasans, from all the forbidden tales my grandfather read to me &mdash; can manipulate the fabric of something different.</p>
<p>&emsp;Time halts to a near standstill, as if fate wills us a chance to escape. The air around me is too slow to draw in my lungs and produce words as Sylvia and I halt our momentum to turn around, but Valentina has fully risen, and her emerald glare penetrates us.</p>
<p>&emsp;The tears stream from her eyes. I realize she has no intention of leaving this place, and I have no power to persuade her. Snuffed of purpose or attachment, she reaches her arms towards us, giving us all the push we need to change our direction and dive for the tunnel. The refuse cascades from the skies before we can reach to save her. She allows the weight of her family above to crush her.</p>
<p>&emsp;Time returns when the hard parts of her crack and she is gone forever. Entombed in her family&apos;s steel duplicity, we never find her, without time to search or bury what&apos;s left.</p>
<p>&emsp;A sound of rustling grasses comes from behind us, and then a whisper: whether they&apos;re hushed voices or the Black Bile, we have no way to know. I reach for my sword, only to realize I left it behind in the rush, along with everything else that might aid me. </p>
<p>&emsp;All I hear is a cry, and I look to Sylvia. Despite the wetness of the rain, reducing her hair to strands of silken black, she sheds no tears, and her chest doesn&apos;t rise or fall. She just stands there, staring in disbelief, as if trying to figure out how she could reverse what just happened.</p>
<p>&emsp;And then it&apos;s several footfalls. The anxiety swells within me, the fight or flight, and I can only think of that ashen adversary drawing closer, panicking over what I might do, wondering what ungodly form it might take, and I grab a severed, rusty bar from the lip of the drainage pipe, hands trembling, unsure of how I&apos;ll even use it.</p>
<p>&emsp;It gets closer, but it sounds like multiple. They get closer. My grip tightens, and I raise the sharp edge, slinking back into the tunnel, knowing the element of surprise is the only leverage I might have, ready to jump, just as Sylvia does the same.</p>
<p>&emsp;And then they&apos;re voices, disjointed, incapable of full sentences. Maybe the tar still holds the minds of their hosts &mdash; their horrific intonation leaves gooseflesh on my body.</p>
<p>&emsp;As soon as it breaks the edge I lunge for it, and it whips around, sword in hand, bashing the metal pipe against the stone wall. It clatters from my grasp, and I&apos;m defenseless. And as I reach to pummel with my right fist, I halt when I see the face of the short figure standing in front of me. </p>
<p>&emsp;Her face flushes of tension. </p>
&quot;Isla,&quot; I whisper."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":25,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":12,"ChapterFull":13,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":25,"Index":40,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"38","Synopsis":"","Summary":"The four climb the hills.

<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s gone . . .&quot; Isla says, but she&apos;s not speaking of Valentina.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It was all so quick,&quot; Jarrett says. Only the two of them are left. &quot;I woke up. Delvin was shouting, saying he had something on him, and I told him to shut up and stop wasting my sleep. But it was so quiet. Not a light beyond our tent, and not even Isla and Vera&apos;s made any sound. That&apos;s when I turned the light on, and realized the smell, the sight of how badly the tar had already infected him, like nothing I had ever seen before. It had his legs. He felt nothing of it, the whole time it ate him away, and he was unable to lift himself, and as soon as he realized, all he could do was scream.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Isla interjects. &quot;That scream saved my life. I awoke to Vera missing, and it&apos;s only now that I realize what she did to us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That bitch!&quot; Jarrett says, swelling with anger just like Romin does. &quot;Never told us of her plan to escape, and she had all the time in the world. She didn&apos;t care about us living through this, only interested in herself and her family.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And I bet Valentina did too, right?&quot; Isla says, as I gather the last of my things.</p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia responds. &quot;She didn&apos;t. She was left behind, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Are you serious? But why?&quot; Isla asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because her family never cherished her like we do,&quot; Sylvia says. Her look is somber as she raises Valentina&apos;s crimson scarf, the one she wore for years to keep her from the blistering cold, and she wraps it around herelf, taking in the scent of Valentina&apos;s perfume as if Valentina could hug her one last time.</p>
<p>&emsp;Isla and Jarrett nod, not probing any further. Jarrett changes the subject. &quot;So where&apos;s Brother Romin?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Missing,&quot; I tell him. &quot;So drowned in his rage over the trade building that he never answered the call to the Merlot. Have you heard anything from the District Twelve Carmine?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not a thing. I haven&apos;t even heard anything from my family, and I spent all night processing that panic,&quot; Jarrett says. He&apos;s the only one with the stomach to turn his eyes back towards the wreckage, whatever parts of the Vermillion family remain after the explosion.</p>
<p>&emsp;He mutters something indiscernible when something catches his eye, and he bends down to lift a piece of the metallic rubble.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is it, Jarrett?&quot; Isla asks. Just as Jarrett takes the shard of ferric debris in his hands, he winces, dropping it back into the scalding pile of scrap.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Essenced explosives. Not just saltpeter mixed in here, but I don&apos;t get it &mdash; the Carmine would never waste this much Essence.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;These are Carmine explosives,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;The plating is our Essence-infused carbon steel. The only box that can hold that much Essence is one made of Essence itself.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;His words make my thoughts stretch further on where Romin has been, and Sylvia ponders the same question. &quot;Is he . . . really capable of such a thing?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;But Isla refocuses us. &quot;Capable or not, that&apos;s not important right now. We have to press for the Afterlife. The inner walls should protect us. In fact, I bet all the survivors are headed there. We press into the city, we&apos;re as good as dead &mdash; if you figure that Chymaeran creature&apos;s taken the life of everyone down there, just at our greatest moment of weakness.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But what will we find at the top, then?&quot; I ask.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter. We have no other choice. We can only concentrate our forces on one goal, and this is the best option,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;We idle and we die. Assume that Endogeny is driven by life power &mdash; by Essence, and it needs it to survive. The only direction it could possibly travel is towards the Afterlife. Those Chymaeran bastards probably planned this all along, just to destroy the whole city and turn it against itself.&quot;</p>
&quot;Let&apos;s go then,&quot; I say. I take Valentina&apos;s Vermillion rifle, knowing she has no further use for it. Sylvia steadies her bow and prepares her quiver, loaded with Essenced arrows that deliver a punch far stronger than a bullet, the only feature that makes it worthwhile. Though we play a losing game, having lost so much before the start, all we can do is press on in the memory of the ones we&apos;ve lost. The voice from my dreams is still so strong, and I still feel the tension in my wrist."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"First Wall","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Thirteen","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Fourteen","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":13,"ChapterFull":14,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":41,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"39","Synopsis":"The fractured group reaches the first inner wall.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.14","Links":{"Wattpad":"https://www.wattpad.com/user/SavantGuarde","Personal":"https://autononymous.io/authors-and-stories/savantguarde/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand/firebrand-1-13","RoyalRoad":"https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/109661/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand-book-one","AO3":"https://archiveofourown.org/works/63835228/chapters/164388994","DeviantArt":"https://www.deviantart.com/savant-guarde"},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

<p>&emsp;It gets warmer the closer we get. Our grafted fireteam sheds skin like a snake, leaving our layers behind in the brush, and I&apos;m already down to a short-sleeve shirt. The air is fresh. Smoke no longer rises from the generators: we&apos;re too far inland to smell the last of it, anyways.</p>
<p>&emsp;There&apos;s little room for talk between heaving breaths. The land is desolate of houses, just stark grasslands, and it infuriates me to think how such land can be unused when the outwallers freeze at the edges of the city. We haven&apos;t seen Endogeny since last night, and we continue climbing up unmarked switchbacks of an untraveled path, hoping the future landscape will open up to anything.</p>
<p>&emsp;We take breaks for Jarrett. Like Romin, his muscle is burdensome, great for quick action and aggressive bursts, but nothing for long distances. We turn around to look at our progress, watching the city grow lower and smaller until buildings are reduced to pebbles in a boundless gravel pit. Despite everything, the view is captivating, and we find ourselves more driven to watch the sight than to press on.</p>
<p>&emsp;The motion feels cathartic despite the worry. I see all the best images float through my mind and out in my heaving breaths. I still see Ellie, knowing nothing of where she was taken. I remember our childhood, the last time she smiled, when mother was still around and Clint didn&apos;t stoop to his endless depression. I know I&apos;m weak, but I find myself praying every hour that I&apos;ll see her again, whether it&apos;s this life or the next one. I know nothing of this world is owed to me, and I learned that fighting tooth and nail for worthiness in the orphanage. But when everything is gone, all that remains is just the flimsiness of hope; the moments when you truly question what immaterial source drives you, what pushes you onwards when nothing remains.</p>
<p>&emsp;All I can do is look to my friends for answers, catching glimpses like cheating during an Academy exam. Isla and Jarrett&apos; expressions are resolute, bodies tensioned, no looseness in them at all. Fear is an exceptional motivator. It&apos;s what drives the Academy, motivating Cadets to climb the ranks: not only fear of failure, but of one&apos;s duty to family and society. I know little of their origins. But without family or society, all that&apos;s left is the anxiety of self-defense against the unknown; the natural Human terror of the dark.</p>
<p>&emsp;But Sylvia surprises me. Her body is as light as theirs is tense, as if she has swallowed the unpalatable weight of grief and begun to process it, and somehow, she looks beautiful: fragile, yet fierce, with a venom that fails to arise from her own vitriol. And then I see the faces of all the people I&apos;ve lost. I feel the blessedness of their presence in my life. I try, just for a moment to be like her, to feel the grief of Valentina&apos;s untimely demise, just as she learned to love herself, wishing so deeply I could undo the pains of that past. </p>
<p>&emsp;I feel my wrist tension. The emotions halt where they always do, and all I have left is to steel myself further. It&apos;s been a full day now, and darkness shadows the horizon. The clouds aren&apos;t too high above us, and I wonder how much further we have.</p>
&quot;We&apos;ll camp here for the night,&quot; Jarrett says, our de-facto leader by size. They left their tents behind, so all we can do is scavenge for sticks, eat our provisions, and cozy by the fire until sleep outweighs the discomfort of the ground. None of us sleep too close. We favor the fire over contact, too absorbed by mutual fears, which are much greater amalgamated mess than Endogeny."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":27,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":13,"ChapterFull":14,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":27,"Index":43,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"41","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Convince cadets to let them in by using fear.","VerboseID":"2.14.27","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"TMZK","Body":"
<p>&emsp;We arrive in the middle of the second day, starving, with no sight of that endogenous black bile. But its presence still lingers close as if it watches us. We catch the irradiated smell of ozone. Sparse trees are stripped of their leaves, and fluid veins glow amethyst. Whether it&apos;s just a property of the upper land, or that Endogeny has drawn such mass that its influence stretches for miles, we don&apos;t know. But a temporary relief rests inside us when we find the inner gates.</p>
<p>&emsp;A cadet hails us from the perimeter walls. He shouts something of Dragon Class, and dirty faces approach the lattice of the portcullis. But the gate doesn&apos;t open.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Prove yourself!&quot; one of them shouts. It&apos;s a lower-class Cadet, but still the highest among them.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Prove what?&quot; Jarrett asks. His irritation peaks from two days of exhaustion. &quot;Just let us in.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Prove you&apos;re not one of them,&quot; he says. He gestures towards the ground beneath the gates, and it&apos;s then that we notice the bodies blended in the brush all around us.. Cadets level rifles to the gates, steadied in the iron mesh, pointed directly at our heads. I look down. Most of the corpses&apos; eyes are amethyst, beginning to fade back from their Human disguises. They&apos;re skin-walkers. The stories are true.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s nothing left to prove, you low-level bastards. Now let us in before I shove those rifles up your ass so far your brain will spray out in gray-matter confetti,&quot; Jarrett says. Carmine run hot-blooded. Some of the minions panic, but their leader is adamant. </p>
<p>&emsp;His fingers touch the lever. &quot;We&apos;re the ones with the upper hand here, not you,&quot; he says. &quot;For all we know, you&apos;re those skin-walkers. Maybe you took the cloaks of Dragon Class and pose as them. We already know they&apos;ve infiltrated the city long before this.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t act like you don&apos;t know, Chymaeran,&quot; he says. I feel an anger twist in me. &quot;A friend I knew for years turned on me.&quot; He shows a scar across his lower torso. &quot;Tried to kill me as soon as things went south, until I killed him first. So don&apos;t think we&apos;re too weak to kill a threat that talks like an ally.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re insane,&quot; Isla says. &quot;Cut your stupid power trip and let us in, that&apos;s an order, Garnet Class,&quot; but he refuses. She only makes the situation worse.</p>
<p>&emsp;One of the Cadets pipes up. &quot;Hey &mdash;&quot; she says, &quot;isn&apos;t that the Valedictorian? From graduation? What&apos;s his name . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot; Several nod, and she turns to their edgy leader. &quot;How else would they know that?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They walk among us. Remember that friend of mine &mdash; they say they even steal their host&apos;s memories.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But that doesn&apos;t justify&mdash;&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;He slaps her across the face. &quot;Don&apos;t speak like that or else we&apos;ll throw you out there with them&mdash;you understand?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia gasps as she looks at the ground. I follow her gaze, and my stomach crumples at the horror of her realization. At least a third of the corpses were actual cadets &mdash; people whose lives they gambled with, and I realize we are reasoning with immoral psychopaths.</p>
<p>&emsp;How to convince them, I think. None of the others understand. This bastard just wants power, so how do I give it to him? Or how do I make it crumble?</p>
<p>&emsp;Fear. Fear is how you do it, I think.</p>
<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;Endogeny is right behind us&mdash;the Chymaeran black bile. That&apos;s why we&apos;re out of breath. We could see it after we packed up camp this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Bullshit,&quot; he says. The cadets grow uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But do you know anything of how to defeat it? Do any of you know its weakness? How to defend against it? It tore through a whole battalion of Dragon Class cadets in a single night. And you&apos;re all doomed to die if you don&apos;t get our help,&quot; I say. I sow further fear. &quot;All of you are weak. You&apos;d piss your pants before you drew your sword or rifle.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But we can&apos;t risk it!&quot; He says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s a risk you can&apos;t afford to take. Would you rather die in an hour or have a chance to live longer? Kill us, and you lose that knowledge. We&apos;re the only ones that survived it. It will liquidate your forces and dissolve you away just like your families,&quot; I say, making sure my face is adamant with rage and resolve.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No. You&apos;re not the leader here&mdash;&quot; he says, but the cadets overtake his power. Beyond his words, he has nothing. He tries defending the lever, grasping on to it as if it were a lone branch in a torrential river, but their forces overpower them.</p>
<p>&emsp;The portcullis opens, just a hair. The stabbing edges rise from the dirt, just enough for us to crawl under, as their demoted leader is forced away. The cadets draw their weapons, trembling, pointing them at us. The truth is that we&apos;re all just kids that have never seen war, only weapons and training. I doubt any of them have the courage to pull the trigger &mdash; all bark and no bite.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What the hell were you doing?&quot; a voice shouts, its figure emerging from a makeshift bedroom inside the walls. A Dragon-Class cloak shimmers. &quot;I make you second-in-command and you raise hell on a power trip. Send this traitor out of here. Go, force him!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The lower-level cadets drag him like subservient ants. He thrashes. They knock him unconscious. They roll his body beyond the gates and close it, though his arms and legs refuse to move. For a moment, I wonder if he&apos;s dead. Some protest, but the others follow his command.</p>
<p>&emsp;He&apos;s the only one I could expect to be drunk on absolute power. But his face lightens in the moment that he sees us, only to frown when he counts four.</p>

<p>&emsp;&quot;Just so we&apos;re clear, I&apos;m in command here,&quot; Romin tells Jarrett. &quot;This is District Twelve, not District Seven.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. Whatever,&quot; Jarrett says.</p>
<p>&emsp;We sit in a makeshift command tent on the dirt-trodden main path. The stumps of four logs make chairs. A wooden board makes a table.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Where is Valentina?&quot; Romin demands.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She didn&apos;t make it. She&mdash;&quot; Isla starts, but she&apos;s cut off by Romin. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I wasn&apos;t asking you,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Titus.&quot; I notice that he tries to dry out the friendliness from his voice, but it wavers just a little. &quot;What happened to her?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I want to shout the incendiary accusation that waits on my tongue and burns my heart. But I&apos;m slightly better at controlling my anger than he is.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She didn&apos;t make it, Romin. She saved our lives. It was the only way we survived down there,&quot; I say. &quot;And don&apos;t cut off Isla. Just because you run this boys&apos; club here doesn&apos;t mean you can forget where you came from.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Rank isn&apos;t anything anymore,&quot; he says. His eyes constantly pass between the guards standing at the front of the tent, noticing how they listen in, knowing he must put on a good show regardless of the cost, thinking it&apos;s the only way he can hold on to whatever he has. &quot;Nothing is left of that past world. All we have is this.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s been three days, Romin! It&apos;s way too early to dive into total anarchy. Let us lead together.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He cringes at that last word, as if I were a lesser wolf threatening his leadership of the pack. There is no pack, just a bunch of stranded idiots. &quot;Don&apos;t challenge me. We still don&apos;t know if you&apos;re Chymaerans or not. Don&apos;t forget that,&quot; he says, and a twinge of resentment sounds in his voice that only I can notice, but he hushes that sound in fear that all the others can hear.</p>
<p>&emsp;He looks again to his &apos;guards&apos; in front of the tent &mdash; I notice he pinned two of the Dragon Class rubies from his mark on their chest. I scoff: no matter what, ego and honor always win.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;In fact, I want you to take these three away,&quot; Romin says, pointing to the rest of our surrogate fireteam. His eyes don&apos;t even meet Sylvia&apos;s. I can tell his fa ade is breaking, and he doesn&apos;t want the others to witness it.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But don&apos;t you know them?&quot; the &apos;guard&apos; asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t question my authority. We&apos;ve already established it,&quot; he says. &quot;This cadet will be the one to either prove or deny. If they fail, they&apos;ll be sent back to the lower city.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Understood,&quot; his minion says. The three refuse to protest &mdash; they know the sheer volume of frightened soldiers that would jump at anything to take commands, to feel even a fraction of direction.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Good luck defusing his power trip,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;Romin. You bring shame to the First Blood of the Carmine.&quot; He spits, but Romin&apos;s face is resolute, staring directly at me. New &apos;guards&apos; cycle to the front of the tent, but he dismisses them.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Leave us,&quot; Romin commands. They follow his orders without hesitation.</p>
<p>&emsp;I lean over the table. It tilts in my direction, balanced only by three makeshift legs. I look him dead in the eyes, more certain than I&apos;ve ever been in my life. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin. You know that we&apos;re not Chymaerans. You and I both know this charade isn&apos;t about that.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He doesn&apos;t respond. He&apos;s already made up his mind, and though his bottom lip quivers, he doesn&apos;t want to waver.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;How the fridging hell did you even get here?&quot; I ask him. &quot;You never came to the Academy. We were so worried about you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You left me, just to replace me with them. Am I that replaceable?&quot; he asks. &quot;Am I that forgettable?&quot; Like a toddler abandoned by his parents for several minutes, craving attention.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin. You never came to us. We were separated. What else were we supposed to do? Wait for you? When you don&apos;t even know where we were? We&apos;d die out there&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He slams his fist on the makeshift table. &quot;Shut up,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;ll have to live with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I scoff. &quot;Live with what, Romin?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;But he continues on. &quot;My mission was assigned down in the city. In fact &mdash; we all were. As the only Dragon Class cadet there, the leadership decided that I was in charge. We defend this foothold of the Upper Lands. Against anyone.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So why do you treat us like this? We&apos;ve been friends for years. You explored beyond the walls with me. You saved me from my room, days ago, when I was too depressed to leave. You&apos;re the one who&apos;s acting the impostor.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;To lead men, you have to rule with an iron fist. You have to do the unspeakable things that no one else will do. You have to show that strength to them, that resiliency to moral nature in the interest of protection, and reinforce it in them, so that they never question you. We&apos;ve entered a time of war. There is no Carmine anymore. There is no Merlot. No . . . Valentina,&quot; his voice wavers, but he corrects it as soon as he can. &quot;All that&apos;s left is the wolves and the sheep. And I am their shepherd.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I remember the non-Chymaeran bodies just past the gates, and my stomach twists. &quot;It was you, then. You had those innocent cadets killed! Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because it&apos;s us versus them.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is that supposed to mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It needs to be us versus them. With no them, there&apos;s no us. The enemy needs a face. These weak soldiers need a &apos;them.&apos; And if that means . . .&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Killing innocent cadets? Sentencing them to death just because you&apos;re afraid? Creating a wild witch hunt to stir chaos, and make them need a leader? That makes you a coward.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; Romin says. &quot;It makes me smart. Fear is the strongest emotion, and if my soldiers rest on the precipice of that fear of death, they will never question me. Only then do they find unity.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re just an egotistical coward,&quot; I tell him. I bend over the wooden board, and he stands up in response. &quot;Let us lead together. Please, Romin. You don&apos;t have to do this alone.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I finally have what I&apos;ve always wanted, and you just want to take it away!&quot; His face screws up, as if he&apos;s on the verge of tears. He regains control when his anger wins over, and he hushes his voice before the distant cadets can hear the weakness in his outburst. &quot;I don&apos;t want to have to decide between the both of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t have to, Romin,&quot; I say. &quot;You can have both. You can have leadership and friends. Great leaders are loved.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Great leaders are feared,&quot; he says. A quick onset of panic rises when he notices his minions have turned around, catching him in a moment of weakness. &quot;And I&apos;m sorry I have to do this.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I only manage a single world. &quot;You&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He draws his fist, erupting it across my face at full force in a cheap shot before I can anticipate. I taste iron as I crumple to the ground.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Take this . . . Chymaeran . . . to the prison,&quot; he says, refusing to look me in the eyes as blood spouts from my nose.</p>
<p>&emsp;The guard pauses. &quot;But shouldn&apos;t we just desert them out there? If they&apos;re Chymaerans? That makes no sense.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;In my anger, I can only manage that single string of words I had been saving to tear at him. Now I can believe it.</p>
&quot;It was your Gods-damn fault she died, Romin!

<p>&emsp;Hours pass in the temporary holding area beneath the wall. Four cells face each other with two on each side, and two cadets stand watch in the aisle between. They&apos;re unsure what prison guards even do beyond the books they&apos;ve read and the films they&apos;ve seen, so they just idle &mdash; whistling as they pace back and forth.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t have to listen to that bastard,&quot; Jarrett insists. He&apos;s said that for hours. Our voices are the only power we have left, as the amorphous mass of Endogeny gets closer.</p>
<p>&emsp;In the evening, I hear the gate raise just a hair. Scouts approach on horseback. Fortunately, the barred window of my cell faces the empty courtyard, and I overhear their conversation.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Valedictorian wasn&apos;t lying. I saw it . . . whatever it was,&quot; he says, &quot;that mess of black stretching further than my eyes could register. What did he tell us to do? The Dragon Class guy?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He hasn&apos;t said a thing. He told us to just wait here.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I can feel the fear I planted stir across the camp. It grows exponentially with each silent minute. My plan is still working, even though I never expected our incarceration. Most of Romin&apos;s cadets are still awake, shivering in the cold, their eyes sunk in crescents of apprehension. With so many cadets, it will only be minutes before the powder keg erupts.</p>
<p>&emsp;And I can start the fire.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What are we to do,&quot; Sylvia says. She reclines on the stone bed of her cell.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I need you all to play along,&quot; I tell them. &quot;We&apos;re watering the seeds of fear I planted at the gates.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t get any ideas,&quot; the guard says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Or else what, cunt? You gonna kill us?&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;A hundred pounds soaking wet, probably bottom of the class. I could snap you like a twig.&quot; The cadet steps back from the holding cell. &quot;Yeah, that&apos;s what I thought.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I turn to the expanse beyond the window. Their panic is growing. The darker the landscape grows, the faster their fires dull without fuel to stoke them, the more anxiety settles. It&apos;s the perfect time now.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re all going to die! The tar is approaching,&quot; I shout. Most of them jump to their feet, gathering their rifles. &quot;The only ones you have that know anything of that creature are in your prison. And you just sit there, you stupid idiots! You&apos;re doing nothing, just waiting to die!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Shut up!&quot; one of them shouts, voice trembling.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You aren&apos;t trained like Dragon Class. That stupid leader of yours has done nothing to prepare you. He doesn&apos;t care about you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is this about,&quot; Romin says, stepping forward from his tent.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right. You have no power here,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;Bastard brother in the Carmine.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I can see it!&quot; Isla shouts. She and Sylvia scream in panic. &quot;It&apos;s right at the gates!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;They rush to the gate, stumbling over each other, and several of them are incapacitated in the stampede. The prison guards don&apos;t know what to do. The commotion rises with the dread like baking soda and vinegar, and I turn to the guards.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re weak, pathetic. You need us,&quot; I tell them. &quot;Let us out and I&apos;ll save your life.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I...I can&apos;t...&quot; one of the guards stammers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Like hell you can&apos;t. You need us.&quot; I can feel their uncertainty draw them to the bars with the keys. &quot;That&apos;s right. Turn the lock.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; he says. But just as he reaches for the lock, Romin descends the stairs, furious. An existential dread cramps his fists, and it seems like he&apos;s about to throw up. He kicks the keys away. One guard passes him to run for the stairs. The other twig that tried to free us collapses on his back.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t even think about it!&quot; Romin shouts. &quot;What the hell are you all doing? You&apos;re making everything worse.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re getting out of here. This isn&apos;t a game. These cadets need to prepare or else they&apos;re going to die, you bald-headed twat,&quot; Jarrett sneers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s time, then,&quot; Romin says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Good,&quot; Jarrett replies, &quot;you finally came to your senses.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No. It&apos;s time to rush the gates,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And let us go,&quot; Jarrett says, but Romin leaves without another word.</p>
<p>&emsp;The keys lie just between Sylvia and Isla&apos;s cell, and Sylvia tries to reach for it, but they rest just beyond her grasp. Isla stares beyond the window, trying to make sense of the landscape. &quot;Gods, it&apos;s actually true, I can see it! It&apos;s right there, getting closer.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Panic is the last thing we need. All we need is to calmly respond,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;Isla, you have thin wrists. Reach for the keys&mdash;&quot; but he&apos;s interrupted by Romin&apos;s voice outside.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s time now, cadets!&quot; he says. He stands atop a makeshift stage of fruit crates. &quot;Now is the time where we fight. The enemy waits at the gates. We must meet them before they destroy us!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is he talking about? Is he talking about going out there?&quot; Sylvia says, as Isla reaches for the keys. She shifts herself. She&apos;s so close.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s suicide,&quot; Jarrett says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All he wants is to be a martyr. All he wants is glory,&quot; I say, &quot;and he&apos;s about to take a hundred cadets unless we stop him.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin beckons with his rallying cry. The cadets respond with nervous cheers, adrenaline eclipsing their fears of death, if only for a moment. They want so badly to be led, to feel a part of something, even if it means until the bitter end, but I refuse to let that happen.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I can&apos;t reach it,&quot; Isla says. &quot;It&apos;s too far.&quot; And then I see a stick just beyond the ground-level window.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Use this,&quot; I tell her. I toss it through the bars, and she grabs for it. She reaches for the key ring, trying to hook it. The rest hold their breath. I watch my friend rally a hundred cadets in martyrdom.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Step forward if you&apos;re courageous. Step back if you&apos;re a coward. This means almost certain death, but you&apos;ll be sacrificing for the betterment of our people, the key tenant of our Academy,&quot; he says. Several step forward. Isla&apos;s arms atrophy.</p>
<p>&emsp;My words can do nothing behind these bars. My heart drops when cadets open the gates. The crowd is divided in two groups of trembling firebrands, about one-to-four, and Romin stirs their emotions further.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ah!&quot; Isla exclaims. The keys are in her hands. She fumbles her fingers against the lock and it opens.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You first. You&apos;re the only one that can stop him,&quot; she tells me. The door clicks, and she throws the iron grate aside. I hear Romin&apos;s cry drown out as it grows further. Endogeny is approaching, and it will spare no one &mdash; not even these cadets with tombstone courage.</p>
<p>&emsp;I break the top of the stairs, heaving, clearing great distance as quickly as my legs will allow me. They&apos;re passing under. The final split is nearly half and half. Hundreds of cadets are going to die just so Romin can feel his last moment of glory. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Stop! Stop, all of you! This isn&apos;t courage or glory. We fight with our minds, not just our hearts!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Only several of them stop, the ones that just broke the line of the gates. I watch their eyes. They see something unspeakable approaching, and then their natural instinct of self-preservation finally kicks in.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Lower the gates!&quot; one cries.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, wait!&quot; the others beyond the walls scream. But it&apos;s too late. The heavy metal gates are already down. Several of them try to climb, to gain whatever height they can as if the floor were molten lava. All the wise can do is watch as their friends trample over each other, regretting their final decision.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You cowards,&quot; Romin shouts. It&apos;s dark, but I can see him weep. &quot;You have no honor. You have no courage! If you die, you will be remembered! You will live forever in the hearts of our people.&quot; But he&apos;s the only one standing that far beyond the walls.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Open the bloody damn gates,&quot; I command. The others hesitate, so I do it myself, just enough that the scrambling cadets can roll through. &quot;Several at a time, or you all will die.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;We can only save twenty before the great cancer Endogeny is too close. My hand trembles on the lever, and I curse Romin for his idiocy in leveraging such a terrible situation on me. When do I lower it? There are still so many that struggle. They&apos;re like rats desperate to escape a flooded drain tunnel. If I don&apos;t lower it now, the rest of us will all die for nothing.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Lower the gates already, it&apos;s going to kill us!&quot; Jarrett shouts, but I&apos;m stuck in indecision.</p>
<p>&emsp;The stranded cadets screech with bloodcurdling cries. I close my eyes, unable to watch the horror as I throw the lever. I hear the cracking of bones. I can hear their screams drown out as the spiked edge of the massive gate lowers on them, while the ones still alive cry, reaching through the bars, resorting back to climbing as they curse me, condemning with the last of their souls as they&apos;re marked for death.</p>
<p>&emsp;Tears crest my eyes, and I fall to my knees. The hate grows stronger, and I want to die here. I couldn&apos;t save them, not all of them. I wish so strongly that the ground could swallow me whole. I anticipate a death so painful that it could repay just a fraction of those lives I&apos;ve sacrificed, wishing I was among them.</p>
<p>&emsp;And then I feel her embrace. Sylvia hugs me. Though her warmth can&apos;t penetrate the depth of my loathing, all I can do is rest there, deprived of the desire to rise from the frostbitten ground, and she raises me.</p>
<p>&emsp;The cadets I saved join her. They stand around me. Hands rest on my shoulders. They thank me for what I&apos;ve done. They pledge their lives to the fight to survive, but even over their voices I can&apos;t refuse to hear the chaos of the soon-to-be-dead; the cacophony of confliction, and so I bury myself further in the dirt.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let me die here,&quot; I plead. But they drag me, away from the lever, away from the walls where twelve cadets&apos; bodies are separated in half, some of their upper halves still crawling as they hold tightly to life, some resigned to their fate, others holding to the top of the gates as they kick lower firebrands off.</p>
<p>&emsp;The last I see is Romin, standing atop a crate like a statue: absolute; galvanized in the strength of his conviction; unyielding though no eyes watch him. He doesn&apos;t hear the screams of the ones he&apos;s stranded. He doesn&apos;t watch them crawl, their arms grow bashed and bloody from thrashing against the iron lattice.</p>

<p>&emsp;They said the iron gates dissolved in a matter of minutes. I refused to turn my head and watch ever since that moment I closed my eyes and bowed my head. </p>
<p>&emsp;I feel so weak. Weak and afraid. Afraid and unworthy to play the executioner in a world of sheer brutality. A single spasm of muscle and I ended the lives of two dozen cadets, condemning to the fate of death before Endogeny could consume them, and I wish I were among them.</p>
<p>&emsp;I refuse to move while the cadets I saved fight for me. That confidence was all a lie: we know nothing of this horrifying amalgamation, and just like Romin, I am nothing but a coward, unwilling to fight, detached from the drive to live for myself.</p>
<p>&emsp;My sins will never be forgiven. Every time I close my eyes I&apos;m met with the face of my dying father, and I remember our final argument. Gods &mdash; I was such a child. And Ellie&apos;s cry, pleading for me to save her when I was powerless and weak, as weak as I am now &mdash; there was nothing I could do for her. Now the two dozen other fatalities join them; they need no faces for me to place their anguish to the bitter end.</p>
<p>&emsp;My body tingles with the desire for motion. All it needs is just a spark, and I search for it within me. How terrible am I, to speak words of courage and how badly these Cadets need us, only to cower here and do nothing? If there&apos;s an afterlife, I don&apos;t deserve it. No acts of valor denote the bookends of my story. I can only redeem a fraction of what I&apos;ve taken if I give myself wholly. There will be no peace otherwise.</p>
<p>&emsp;I draw Valentina&apos;s Vermillion rifle. I loaded it moments before, considering pulling the trigger when Sylvia wasn&apos;t looking, but the thoughts of leaving her in her last moments weeping over the body of a friend who killed himself is too much to bear.</p>
<p>&emsp;So I decide I won&apos;t live for myself anymore. I steady the rifle to the sound of battle cries beyond the barracks, and the memory of distant dreams harmonize between my ears, singing that I was born to this world as nothing more than a sacrifice. There need be no spirit when it impedes the soulless machine of battle. The pain of sorrow can no longer hurt me. The pleasures of love pass through me as phantoms of a life I don&apos;t deserve. I&apos;ve always lived just to die for others, and now in the final chapter, I must steel myself in those vows.</p>
<p>&emsp;My ears ring. All I can hear is the sound of my own heartbeat, and all I can feel is the trembling ground beneath my feet with every explosion. For once my mind is entirely clear, unrestrained by primal fear. Endogeny pours through the melted gates like molten magma rock, a conscious mass of blackened innards, bone, and tendons, splitting and merging in an orchestrated cacophony. Explosions rip chunks that launch skyward, leaving craters that mend in seconds. The front lines keep dragging backwards, driving us up the hill. </p>
<p>&emsp;The mass is conscious and horrifying. It contains the memories of all the lives it&apos;s taken. When it splits into humanoid projections, armed with obsidian swords composed of the hardest parts of its victims, it seems as if each cadet can discern the faces, and I soon learn that hesitation is its strength.</p>
<p>&emsp;So many figures withdraw from Endogeny like hail from a storm cloud. They grow legs when they need to go faster; additional arms when engaged in swordsmanship. My hands are steady when I draw the rifle, finger posed on the trigger at the perfect angle. I pull when the sights line on a blackened torso. They crumble like wax idols, dissolving into the dirt, waiting to be remerged with its greater form, too small to be capable of motion. I pull the bolt back and chamber another round, just as the front lines are pushed a hundred feet from the stone walls.</p>
<p>&emsp;The great mass shapes all its victims in flesh before the living, a master weaver of sinew and bone; a sculptor with skill as divine as the Chymaeran Gods. It reaches within to the memory of every victim to project the images of everyone that cadet has ever loved.</p>
<p>&emsp;I watch Isla&apos;s hands tremble as Delvin and Vera appear before her. Flushed in false color like glazed tar pottery, I&apos;m surprised when these projections try to resist, but no matter what, Endogeny collapses them to reform again, endless as the waves against the shore of Blackwater&apos;s lakes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t hesitate! Hesitation is death,&quot; I shout, but I cannot hear the sound of my own voice, and I&apos;m sure not many listen either. The lines draw closer. I know these are my final moments. </p>
<p>&emsp;I want to die away from my friends, somewhere they won&apos;t find me, to an enemy that leaves its victims with no recognition.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Pull back! Pull back,&quot; the Cadets shout, but I don&apos;t listen. Our faith tells us of the Reservoir of Souls, where the dead reconvene before being reborn into a new life. You can only be freed when you entirely release the attachments of your past life, and I pray if I succumb in a final act of valor that I might be found worthy to see the ones I love again.</p>
<p>&emsp;I want to come home to my mother. I want to feel the warmth of her embrace again. I want to cry and tell her how hard this life has been, how sorry I am that I was too weak to protect her daughter. I want to apologize to my father. I want us to be a family again, wherever that future world takes us, no matter how long we might wait there in the Reservoir, how many words and tears it might take to settle the woes of this endless nightmare.</p>
<p>&emsp;And I feel my grasp loosen on the rifle, the last piece of a cherished friend who waits for me on the other side. I can feel her spirit in every stroke of the bolt, the jarring crash of the debris that killed her in every blast. The concept of death horrifies me, no matter how much I galvanize myself against the values of life, and I hate that feeling. I hate the self-preservation that draws the breath when I hold it as long as I can. Will it be painless? Did poor Delvin feel nothing when it took his legs and he was beyond the point of no return?</p>
<p>&emsp;Endogeny has focused on me. I&apos;ve disappeared from Sylvia, Isla, and Jarrett in the scrum of two hundred cadets, the closest on the front lines, and I know now is the time to give in. I can pray that I&apos;ll see them on the other side: there&apos;s no chance for anyone.</p>
<p>&emsp;Endogeny erects three masses, drawing a ten-foot circle around my feet, closing me in. It chisels them in convulsions of muscle and sinew, drawing the memories of my beloved that succumbed to its influence.</p>
<p>&emsp;Their guise adapts from memory. Endogeny searches the neurons of minds that recall me for emotion of the strongest memories. One rises with the cloak of a city guard, strong with muscle. A mess of black sharpens into a prickled beard. The figure is unfinished, but not by accident; the arm crumbles off as if it were a statue mistakenly blemished by its creator.</p>
<p>&emsp;To the side rises Romin. Further right rises Valentina, their faces just slightly off, enough that it twists my stomach and sends shivers down my spine, as if they were formed by an amateur artist who had only seen them in passing, who knew nothing of proportions.</p>
<p>&emsp;They extend their arms to me. We can be free, forever, they speak, without words. I feel my hands loosen further on the rifle. I feel myself drawn towards their embrace, wanting so badly to succumb, to give my life for one last feeling of warmth to send me off. </p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s a gift to die here, and I feel my breath falter. My heart slows. Endogeny presses another ten feet up the hill, and I&apos;m left far behind in the circle.</p>
&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; I tell them. &quot;I&apos;m sorry I couldn&apos;t save you. I don&apos;t deserve this mercy.&quot; The circle draws closer as they approach. The rifle falls from my hands, and just when I think I&apos;m going to lose myself entirely, color begins to flush in the shadowed face of my father."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":3,"AutoNameFull":31,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":14,"ChapterFull":15,"ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":31,"Index":48,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"Revised","Keywords":"","UUID":"46","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Clint resists, driven by regret and guilt, unable to save his son.

<p>&emsp;The circle halts. Endogeny freezes around me. I can see a tension in its mass, some force resilient against the command to consume. </p>
<p>&emsp;The form of my father resists. The colors grow sharper. The cloak saturates, and his arm grows from bone. He twinges, as if the conscious anguish metastasizes in a physical struggle for command of his form.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You deserve . . . everything . . . of the world I couldn&apos;t give you,&quot; he mutters, as his true colors flush entirely, and he detaches from Endogeny. His skin is smooth, no longer worn with age. An iron sword carved from memories of his time as a guard is tensioned in his hand, and the gift of a locket I gave him as a child holds around his neck.</p>
<p>&emsp;He&apos;s no older than I am. He looks around twenty. Cords of finely-honed muscle brazen his arms, and the past design of the Dragon Class mark pours from his shoulders.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t die an early death and live the rest of it in regret. Don&apos;t make the same mistake as me,&quot; he pleads. &quot;In death I will protect you the way I never did. I hope it &mdash; amounts &mdash; to anything,&quot; he says, slashing at the forms of Romin and Valentina, decapitating them. They fall back to the uphill river of black tar.</p>
<p>&emsp;The creatures turn to me. I&apos;m a hundred feet inside the bounds of Endogeny. They take the faces of any victim I&apos;ve ever seen: the postman that greeted me every day at the door. All my beloved Academy instructors. Valentina and Romin. Even the face of my mother &mdash; and so I realize it ravaged the graveyards for flesh as fuel, too.</p>
<p>&emsp;But the postmortem specter of my father braces. I can feel the immense pain he takes to keep this form apart from Endogeny, and I know it won&apos;t hold forever. I watch him raise his hand as the tar river slims in front of me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I reach for the rifle only to find it has already been taken. He extends his new arm to clasp my hand. In the firmness of my grasp, it molds to take the form of the sword he bought me when I began my training at the Academy almost fifteen years ago, the sword I threw out in anger when our arguments boiled over into rage, when I began to hate him so much that I stopped visiting him for leisure.</p>
<p>&emsp;Bone and sinew contract to form the appearance of carbon steel. The weapon is brutal and resilient, literally forged of love and memory, far stronger and sharper than any weapon I&apos;ve ever used.</p>
<p>&emsp;The projection of my father and I stand together. Our movements play in an immaculate last dance of slashes. The sword I hold floats with the lightness of my family&apos;s love. The sound of every slice graces with rekindled memories of my mother&apos;s voice. When it connects with the black wax of dark dopplegangers, it slices through with the sharpness of my father&apos;s lessons, the strength he taught me before sadness divided us. Every step is another memory, and as a blade dancer, I can feel an entire life flash before my eyes.</p>
<p>&emsp;I watch the colors of my young father fade. His strength over the conscious mass weakens as I re-approach the edge of the tar, so close to breaking through, although the creatures mutate faster. The last memory of Clint and I reduce the masses to their earthly graves &mdash; just enough impedance before they reform ahead of us, and we&apos;re slicing at them all over again.</p>
<p>&emsp;But that detachment still holds within me. In the beauty of this last moment, I can&apos;t think of it as anything more than a last fruitless effort. The line of freedom is still so far away, and what is it for? Just for another hour alive to succumb later. I can see Sylvia slashing from the other end, out of arrows, reduced to a scavenged sword, and she cries out for me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I still can&apos;t feel any reason to live for myself. The love of others is beautiful, but not persuasive enough. I can feel the exhaustion flood my muscles. I know I cannot keep this up forever. Ninety percent of the cadets have been extinguished. The remaining are stranded atop the perimeter walls, their high ground a stranded island surrounded by seas of liquid charcoal.</p>
<p>&emsp;I see Isla&apos;s face appear among the tar-bound doubles, and a piece of my soul fractures when I sever her neck, slicing like butter with no hardness of a spine. I&apos;ve lost her. And when Jarrett joins Romin, I feel the spirit of my resistance dissolve.</p>
<p>&emsp;My hands are frail and weak. Endogeny gains strength as my father fades. Sylvia is still so far away, and I hope I can apologize to her in another life. </p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m not strong enough for this battle.</p>
<p>&emsp;The will to live for myself is too weak.</p>
<p>&emsp;So my slashes grow sloppy, my dodges slow like moving through molasses, and obsidian blades begin to slice my skin.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that I fall to the ocean of tar, to become another face that haunts the living.</p>
<p>&emsp;My father stands over me, reminding me of the times we practiced in the back yard of the house with training equipment. So many rounds after the passing of my mother he would stand over me in resentment, feeling pleasure in letting me saturate in that pain, as if I could feel the hurt of loss for him. But here his body covers me, no color left to distinguish him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry I couldn&apos;t save you,&quot; Clint says, before his mouth seals over with the tar, robbing him of any further words. He dissolves back to nothingness as I feel Endogeny overtake me, the heaviness like water torture with a weighted blanket, and I try to force my last thoughts to be of the life after this one.</p>
I catch a final image of Sylvia standing over me before my face is overtaken. With no breath, mouth, or nose to shout, I watch as it overtakes her. The viscosity collapses her alongside me, and we lay there, entombed in Endogeny just as Valentina laid once beneath the wreckage."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Summit","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Fifteen","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Sixteen","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":15,"ChapterFull":16,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":49,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"47","Synopsis":"Titus reaches the end of his journey.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.16","Links":{"Wattpad":"https://www.wattpad.com/user/SavantGuarde","Personal":"https://autononymous.io/authors-and-stories/savantguarde/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand/firebrand-1-15","RoyalRoad":"https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/109661/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand-book-one","AO3":"https://archiveofourown.org/works/63835228/chapters/164389339","DeviantArt":"https://www.deviantart.com/savant-guarde"},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

<p>&emsp;In the conscious collective mind of Endogeny, there&apos;s a part of me still there, a part of my blood. It refuses the connection like oil and water, but in those places it connects, I feel the consciousness of a million humans.</p>
<p>&emsp;I can feel memories, all their last moments of horror, attachments of what it feels like to love and hate. I can feel the nameless essence of who they all were, as our memories have all been joined together. My connection is weak but I still search for her, so many faces like the young girl I raised, though none are Ellie. A part of me feels relief that she&apos;s free of this place, hoping that she&apos;s still alive somewhere, and I pray she finds the strength to live on.</p>
<p>&emsp;My brain sends signals to my arms and legs, and I&apos;m surprised when I still feel them there. The only sensation that holds me to this world is a hand still clasped in mine, and I feel the incredible strength of her Essence, coupled with a part of myself that&apos;s unpalatable to Endogeny.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s as if I can feel divinity flood my circuits. I recall dreams of holy blood. And for the first time in my life, I feel the true strength of my Essence in physical form, resisting the black bile and refusing to merge. </p>
<p>&emsp;Endogeny gives me a vision as it tries to overtake me. I&apos;m trapped chest-deep in a black tar of gnashing faces that have no lungs to scream. The humanoid faces cover the floor, walls, and ceiling. I try to resist by pushing myself out with my arms, only to find that the scar on my wrist is tethered with a glowing, crimson thread, attached somewhere beyond the layers of black bile above me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I use the thread to free myself, climbing it like the ropes at the Academy fitness course though the bile impedes my motion. I&apos;m nearly free when I hear the resonance of something that almost sounds electric.</p>
<p>&emsp;Something angular and unnatural protrudes from the amalgamation of flesh: large, obsidian, and planar with sharp, slender limbs.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So many millions I&apos;ve brought to this unity. But you still resist.&quot; Its voice crackles through that same electric resonance like changing radio frequencies. Its thick, shelled armor is an extension of its body: the edges contoured with gold, and its triangle of eyes glows beneath the surface of the thick shell covering its face. &quot;I am Endogeny, demigod of the Chymaera: called back to this world by a Mask of the Gods, to act on the only purpose for which I was created.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A Mask?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Mask. The divine conduit between the will of the Gods and the impermanent life of the Humans, the righteous conductor holding a fraction of their power. Have you truly never heard of this?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;It stabs its slender arm into one of the faces, withdrawing what might be thoughts or memories. &quot;Look at that. Not a single human in this age knows the truth. Are you all just ignorant?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why are the Chymaera attacking Blackwater?&quot; I ask, still trying to free myself as Endogeny watches. &quot;What does this frozen wasteland have that you could ever possibly value? Is it the powers of the Afterlife?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I have no knowledge of what demand compels me. I am only a force of nature. Yet, for the first time, I have a master of mixed heritage &mdash; with only half the blood of Chymaeran divinity.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;The demigod approaches.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The other half is just like yours. Human.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;It reaches to try and sever the thread with a swipe of one of its arms, but it only pulls me out further. The thread refuses to give. Something else does first, and so Endogeny cries in anguish. Part of its arm is missing, and as it wills it to grow back from the conscious bile, it cries out.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is this? All these Essence-less cattle, yet you&apos;re nothing like them. A connection to the Gods,&quot; it says. &quot;You have no business here. Get out!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The scrum of eyeless faces condense as Endogeny disappears into the walls. It feels as if I&apos;m being digested: the bitter smell of death and rot as these amalgamated fleshy intestines try to digest me like a swallowed coin. But the thread tensions. I feel myself withdrawn from this viscous grave like an ingrown hair torn from flesh. Layers upon layers of arms and legs and faces of living muck pass me, and when I break the surface, I sprawl atop a large mound of dark, ashen clay, surrounded by an infinite crystalline plane of obsidian.</p>
<p>&emsp;An uncountable crowd of silhouettes stumble across the crystalline desert: lost souls waiting to be reborn. Somewhere far in the distance is the only non-reflective surface, just like in all the prophetic tales of life after death: the void of rebirth.</p>
<p>&emsp;I try to run for it, but I find this thread is attached somewhere far above me. My feet leave the mound of conscious clay and I swing forwards before returning to the point from whence I tried to escape, only to find a second thread extending down somewhere else.</p>
<p>&emsp;My ethereal form indents in the muck. Next to me is a young girl dressed in immaculate, white clothes, holding on to the other end of the thread. She lifts her wrist. My thread extends upwards to infinity, but so does hers. I can only imply ours are tethered together.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A million souls held for ransom, incapable of being reborn until the moment they&apos;re all released,&quot; she says. &quot;That&apos;s the power of Endogeny.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;This is not the world I remember. This must all be a vision. I look around. The sky is missing, replaced with planar surfaces of obsidian at an infinite distance, as if I float from within a hollow geode lit by the faintest purple light. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;This is the Reservoir,&quot; I say. &quot;The true afterlife.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes. But your time has not come yet. And if your stubbornness persists the same way as the one that came before you &mdash; all you will ever be is a visitor.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A visitor to death? I gave myself to die &mdash; Losing my family, my friends, all the ones I care for, even the one I love . . . it was too much to bear alone,&quot; I say. &quot;And I&apos;m done.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You made a pact! You gave up your divine gift for this, so you don&apos;t get to back out now,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There is no gift. And there was no pact. I was reborn just like all these lonely souls,&quot; I say. &quot;I deserve the freedom to die. This life was miserable: grinding hard for success at the Academy just for it all to be thrown away. For what? I hated this life!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But you bartered for it. You made a deal with me for another chance to make things right. Do you even remember where you came from?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I was an orphan, found by my grandfather Everett beyond the walls.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What parents abandon their child beyond the walls? How would you not freeze in seconds? There is nothing that lives out there. You know that, yet you refuse to accept it. I can only assume that piece of myself I sent protected you until the time was right.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then where else do I come from? Why would Everett lie?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You were reborn from the soil of that shallow grave. You were kept alive by our deal, threaded to a piece of me. Your promise was to fix Mother Khiras&apos; mistake in exchange for a second wind. Did you really forget it all? Did my divinity not forestall the effects of rebirth?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s your failure,&quot; I tell her. &quot;It&apos;s your fault that I forgot all of that. I lived as full a life as I could. But my friends are dead; my family is dead; my sister is missing; the entire city and all that remains of humanity is reduced to a rotting mass of flesh. I lost everything! Gods above . . . or here, or wherever they are, have you even seen the suffering it&apos;s taken to get here?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just a daughter of the races&apos; Gods. I cannot see all the affairs of mortals like they can. I simply exist until I&apos;m called to take their place.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And this purpose made you send me to suffer?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No. That purpose was mother Khiras&apos;s ignorance. She preyed upon another guilt-ridden Mask of the Gods with the same offer. Rebirth is a cleansing process that purges the vitriol of past lives, but mother Khiras used him for her own purpose, allowing his to persist, letting him cycle over and over until the perfect end pleased both of them. But that perfect end never came.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So you gave me the same curse. You&apos;re sick.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You were the one that asked me for it. You pleaded me for it: you even pleaded to go with me, persuading me to escape the ennui of a meaningless infinity as a Goddess&apos; child. You told me how much I would suffer in mortal flesh, how much it hurt when you passed on. But you promised me it was worth it; how much you loved your father and mother; your sister; the entire experience of life no matter how much it hurt you and left you for dead. So who do I speak to now? Do you lie just like all the other mortals that came before you, brokering deals with the divine for a life to squander?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I spent an entire life since that moment never giving up, even when I should have, yet it still broke me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then I guess it&apos;s luck that keeps you alive. My blessing saved you. Divine energy made you unpalatable to Endogeny.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The slack in the thread tensions. I feel the vibrations of something far beyond this realm: the first sensation of touch I&apos;ve experienced since I visited here.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And among the living, you&apos;re no longer welcome here. Your mission is to be the infinity that cancels out that other malignant force of infinity.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then how can I ever be done if it never ends?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;By cultivating the only thing your opponent lost along the way,&quot; she says. &quot;The reason I thought you would be different. The reason I thought you could liberate reality from this endless stalemate, a stalemate that even the Gods are powerless and blind to.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;The slack begins to viciously tug at my wrist. I look up to find that a thousand other threaded figures suspend from the obsidian sky like flies wrapped by spiders.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;This is the beginning of a long journey. And those are all the failed outcomes you have yet to leave behind.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I try to resist as the thread as it jostles my weightless form. &quot;How can I end this? How can I ever be free?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The same way you find the end of a circular path. Your journey had a beginning on this circle. There may be no edges to mark your progress, but that which begins must always have an end. You are the only being alive not controlled by fate: a mortal with infinite paint, yet a limited canvas. And you will die forever unless you answer the question he forgot to ask . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Her radiant eyes pierce mine with a final glance.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot; . . . How can the greatest work of art in all existence ever be complete?&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;I expect to find myself deposited in the foxholes of the foothills when I awake at the end of the thread. My mouth is no longer bitter with natural taste of iron and dirt. There&apos;s no biting cold to freeze craters of mud as unsealed coffins for mass burial, but a peaceful warmth, and when I open my eyes to try and lift myself from the softness of this place I&apos;ve been carried, there is only gold and white.</p>
<p>&emsp;My muscles ache with atrophy. It feels like a training day, as if I&apos;m flooded with the soreness of a full-body Academy workout, and when I try to lift my legs from the blanket wrapping me in a warm embrace, something heavy resists my right leg.</p>
<p>&emsp;I let a small groan escape the grimace tensioned in my lips: flexing everything to mitigate the pain, I&apos;m unable to pull myself from this barricade of sheets. I test every muscle in my body. The pin-and-needle response of tingling means it&apos;s there, and I try to pulse the blood back through my veins, waking the whole rest of my body to catch up with my conscious mind.</p>
<p>&emsp; I whistle when I draw a full breath through my chapped lips. I can finally remember the circumstances that brought me here, and it all comes rushing back to me. Clint. Ellie. Valentina and Romin. Sylvia buried beneath Endogeny, and now it&apos;s just me, alone in a white room, staring at the ceiling while the warmest breeze I&apos;ve ever felt dances in the drapes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gone . . . all gone,&quot; I say, and I want to cry so badly, but I&apos;m so parched of water that my body refuses to waste any of it. I can only cry through whatever lonely words my lungs will offer to the empty, humid air; pleading for death as if that little girl still listens at the other end of the thread. I put the last of my energy into any muscle that will heed my call. I drag myself to the side of the bed, and once I pass the threshold of soft comfort, I slide off the edge, crashing to the floor.</p>
<p>&emsp;The cloaked figure at the end of the bed jolts from slumber, wearing garments that belong to the Afterlife&apos;s Royal Guard. I find the very premise of my value to the divine acolytes of the Afterlife to be too absurd to believe, let alone the fact that one of their own would be assigned to oversee my recovery. But when the stranger withdraws the hood that brought them to lightless slumber, I find she is not a stranger after all, but the last person that entombed herself in Endogeny along with me.</p>
<p>&emsp;She speaks my name in a dazed panic, finding my upper body crumpled against the floor and the edge of the bed with my legs still dangling upright: my naked body atrophied of muscle and overcome with a rash that covers much of it. Her dark hair brushes my bare chest as she bends down to lift me in her arms, and I feel so humiliated and weak. She deposits me on the bed so she can bury her head in my chest, too broken yet to form a sentence, and I let her cry for the both of us, tracing my trembling fingers through her hair since my body has no warmth to offer her. </p>
<p>&emsp;We rest there for what feels like hours. It&apos;s how long it takes for her to conjure the first words, alive in an Afterlife where we still cannot see the ones we cherish.</p>
<p>&emsp;Hearing my heartbeat reassures her that I&apos;m still here. &quot;After all we lost . . . I&apos;m not letting you go like them,&quot; she says, mumbling the words into my sternum.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I thought it was over,&quot; I say. &quot;But you were there alongside me. It swallowed us together &mdash; how come you aren&apos;t hurt like I am?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because Endogeny never touched me. And when it washed over you, trying to consume your life and Essence, to assimilate you, to rob you of every feature I cherish . . . I tried everything to free you. To pull you from it. To cover you with my body so that it might ignore the both of us. But after all I tried, it didn&apos;t matter &mdash; it gave up on you on its own.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The dream returns to me. I look at the birthmark on my wrist.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The thread,&quot; I mutter. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The what?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Nothing. Just a dream,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But then the Afterlife found us. Said something about pure blood, and then they took us into the city. And then Ullrich was there. He spoke of our potential&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ullrich? As in . . . the Grandmaster?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right. You shared a stage with him. And he said we were special compared to the ones that died, that there was something inside us, and he extended an offer that I accepted for the two of us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;His word choice bothers me, but I assume she misspoke.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What offer?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He remembered you from graduation. That our fireteam was in the highest echelon of the Academy. He said that we were meant to join the Afterlife&apos;s Royal Guard, to join with the other Dragon-Class cadets in a mission to strike back against the Chymaera beyond the walls. To literally serve the Gods like they do!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And you just accepted this without thinking about it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The question catches her off-guard. She lifts her head from my chest and meets my eyes with her crimson rings, finding disbelief in my skepticism. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You just accepted this proposal right away. Without time to grieve, or metabolize this, or process it in any way, or to ask me? It&apos;s been how many days?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Two. And I&apos;ve been here for almost all of it, besides swearing in.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Swearing in?&quot; I scoff. &quot;I thought it&apos;d be an eventuality, that at least it was an &apos;eventual yes&apos; or something like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There was no reason not to, and with the path we were following before all this, it was only a continuation of that.&quot; She wipes her eyes, taking a moment to metabolize this discomfort between us. &quot;I don&apos;t know. I just thought you&apos;d be ecstatic about this opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t have room for that feeling right now. All I have is grief. For Romin. For Valentina. For my father, my sister, for Vera and Jarrett and Delvin, and . . . I haven&apos;t told you yet, but my father died right in front of me. He died in my arms in my childhood home, trying to save his daughter!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&mdash;I didn&apos;t know that. I&apos;m sorry,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;It bothers me. &quot;How can you just move on like this? All these people you love. Can&apos;t we take some time together to just process this if we&apos;re building the strength to live on? Well, no. I guess we can&apos;t, if you went ahead and signed your life away.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I was never in a place to experience . . . that. Not once. Not ever. And I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever really had that.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What, family?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I was never chosen like you were, Titus. Maybe your mother made me feel like a part of your family before she died, but then they tossed me to the streets at eighteen, and I was only financially saved by the Academy, by our rank, by riding the coattails of you and Romin and Valentina!&quot; She tensions her hands around the sheets. &quot;I don&apos;t have any other family with them gone. I never did. Only the four of us, and with them gone, all I have is you. And I was certain, so certain you&apos;d be willing to take this leap with me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I just don&apos;t understand why it doesn&apos;t bother you. It just seems inhuman to want to move on so quickly. Don&apos;t you feel anything?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I am sad. I assure you, but when I thought I lost everything &mdash; you, the others, I just felt this panic inside me that was so much stronger than grief. This fear that overwhelmed any inkling of that sadness: that same feeling when I was on the streets; when the older kids in the orphanage did those horrible things to us, and even more so to me . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Sylvia,&quot; I say. I draw her closer to me and embrace her with whatever warmth I can muster.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And it was just like everything else didn&apos;t matter,&quot; she sobs. &quot;I was petrified. I was actually a PART of something for so long, not having to think about what it felt like being on the outside again, and I remembered that feeling, sitting alone in that room before you might visit me, feeling so distant and vacant like I came from nowhere, only to be a soulless thing with no more autonomy to move than one of those training dummies . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It must have been hard,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And I just knew that I had to never feel like that again, no matter the cost, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I do know,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel the wetness from her eyes seep into the covers. I brush her hair to the side the same way I did when we were alone together in that terrible place, and it slowly calms her. </p>
<p>&emsp;My voice cracks when I muster the words from my dry mouth. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;As long as I last, I&apos;ll be here,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;She pauses for a moment, and just like every time before, a part of me fears those three words will rise from either of us. We&apos;ve spent our lives saying everything but as if it were some dangerous incantation, even though our connection is so far beyond them.</p>
<p>&emsp;So I say a different three.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll be here,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll be here for you too,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;ll consider it. Probably end up taking the same oath, but I need time,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
Several minutes pass before her breaths return to a calm rhythm and she lifts herself from my chest. She gathers her things together, mentioning that she has the first responsibilities of her service to attend to today, leaving me with a few sweet words before she breaks the threshold of the door. It&apos;s only moments after Sylvia departs that the Grandmaster Ullrich surprises me with his presence: not only to extend the offer, but to surprise me by asking for something else."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"The Grandmaster","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Sixteen","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Seventeen","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":16,"ChapterFull":17,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":52,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"50","Synopsis":"Titus encounters Ullrich for a second time.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.17","Links":{"Wattpad":"https://www.wattpad.com/user/SavantGuarde","Personal":"https://autononymous.io/authors-and-stories/savantguarde/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand/firebrand-1-16","RoyalRoad":"https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/109661/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand-book-one","AO3":"https://archiveofourown.org/works/63835228/chapters/164389456","DeviantArt":"https://www.deviantart.com/savant-guarde"},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ve been getting a lot better, son, and it&apos;s only been a day. That&apos;s the power of the Afterlife. Of our resources,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Do you not remember me?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Your face is everywhere,&quot; I tell him. My voice is hoarse after only a couple words with Sylvia, so all I can manage is a whisper. &quot;Ullrich Valensend. The highest emissary of the Afterlife. I shared a stage with you at graduation.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He scratches his dark, salt-and-pepper beard before brushing his jet-black pompadour to the side, revealing several streaks of undyed silver. His face wrinkles with a smile against worn frown lines, drawing his hands in the pockets of white-and-gold clothes that conceal all of his skin. &quot;A rousing speech you gave, there, valedictorian,&quot; he says. &quot;You gave hope and spirit to all those graduates. You might be the reason they saved us from the Chymaera.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I wish I could have done more. Our people survived that attack. And for the ones we lost, you can all live in their honor.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Honor,&quot; Ullrich says. It sounds like he laughs, but continues with a cough. &quot;Yes. They were very honorable in their purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But the civilians &mdash; did you save any of them?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They perished. Endogeny was far too strong for them. They have no Essence like us, gifted from the Gods. And that &apos;us&apos; is what brings me to the reason I&apos;m here, Titus, because all of this: Essence transfusion; the insistence of Sylvia; a warm bed and a seat in the Afterlife; all of this is not free, and we didn&apos;t bring you here so you could give up. Despite what those rustbloods down below think, we don&apos;t just worship the gods. We all work. And with the Essence potential that sets you and your girlfriend aside from your colleagues in the Academy, you have a special opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;It looks as if he expects me to leap in the air, throw the covers off and dance on my aching bones, predicating his next words with joy, but the heart doesn&apos;t heal anywhere close to that fast. &quot;I can&apos;t pivot that quickly in all this grief. Gods above . . . minutes ago, I was begging for death to finish me off.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But now you have a reason to live on, Titus. I was exactly like you, once. I see myself in you, and do you know how I got to this point? Do you know where I came from?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not at all. Except that they said it was like you came from nowhere, with exactly the right words for everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I&apos;m good with words. I&apos;ve had lifetimes to practice,&quot; he says. &quot;The Essence of the Afterlife has kept me alive for more than a hundred years, and before that, I explored this world as a Mask of the Gods. As the firstborn child to the king of Northaven, I was betrayed and cast aside by my own family. But I still had the divine birthright. So I carried on, and when Northaven fell to the Chymaera, my wife and I moved to Blackwater. We had a family of two children. We lived beyond the walls in peace for a while, but even there, the Chymaera tried to attack my family.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It just never ends, that suffering . . . &quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It never does. I saved them so many times, yet once, I faltered and lost it all. And yet I still stand here today right in front of you, because I still believe there is something to save.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Maybe I don&apos;t understand it yet, the way that he does, so I humble myself.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;How do you go on when you&apos;ve lost it all, when there&apos;s no way back?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t. And anybody who tells you to move on is a pathetic fool, Titus. There is no price too high for redemption. And if you have to pay with blood, you will fight a glorious and honest battle. Being forced to try again and again is what saved me. Death was no longer an option, like you think it is for you. Sometimes there is a way back, and that attitude is what got me to champion the Afterlife, reshaping all of Blackwater into something better.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then why do you bother with someone like me?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because I think everyone who fights for all and asks for so little deserves the world,&quot; he says. &quot;Especially if they&apos;re special like us. You&apos;re not like the rustbloods. That girl of yours didn&apos;t save you: you saved yourself, because you had enough Essence. Do you know why we call this place the Afterlife?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because you commune with the Gods themselves? Because your prayers bring sustenance to all of Blackwater?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, gods below . . . it&apos;s because we reach higher than that,&quot; Ullrich says. &quot;And I want you to defend that dream with us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is it the Afterlife dreams of?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They dream of power and peace. And they might not know it, but for me, it&apos;s enough Essence to bring me back to that golden age,&quot; Ullrich adds. He gestures to someone beyond the door, another Royal Guard, carrying neatly-folded threads of the Royal Guard that look strangely familiar. &quot;I want you &mdash; no, you&apos;re going to &mdash; join me in this sacred mission.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;His acolyte sets them on my lap, and I lift my hands from beneath the covers. The texture&apos;s the same as Sylvia&apos;s uniform: impossibly perfect in their stitching and warmly infused with Essence. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re having a service today to remember the sacrifices it&apos;s taken to keep that dream alive. I want you to speak to all the . . . &apos;honor&apos;,  it took, for us to get to this point.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That, I can manage,&quot; I tell him, and he puts his hands on my shoulders. </p>
<p>&emsp;My heart still longs for the ones whom I never got to say goodbye. I decide I&apos;ll speak to their honor, if it&apos;s the last thing I do, and if I find my ambitions rise higher, I will serve the divine quest to live on for the ones I love. Something makes me uncomfortable putting on the uniform, but here and now under this pressure, I don&apos;t think I have the time. I pray I&apos;ll be able to find it later without a choice.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Come with me. You&apos;re not aware yet of what you and I are capable of. Together, in our endless struggle, I&apos;d say we have more power than the very gods.&quot; He extends his hand to offer his strength, and I can tell he feels a certain pleasure in how he arranges words. &quot;Walk alongside me, and you&apos;ll help me in my quest to return to that past.&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;&quot;Where is everyone? Is the Afterlife always this empty?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course not,&quot; one of the three escorts says. The light hurts my eyes when I break the threshold of the infirmary&apos;s doors, and I shield them with my pallid wrist. The uniform I wear is unbecoming of the weakness I exude: the perfectly-woven obsidian threads in cacophony with my tangle of messy hair and unkempt beard; my white flesh contrasting the color of a population that spends much of their time basking in the radiant light, even if their hands aren&apos;t calloused and dirty like the ones that toil below.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then where are they?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;He gestures toward the shining center of the city.</p>
<p>&emsp;It takes a moment for my eyes to accommodate the vast distance. For so long I&apos;ve only looked at close things: faces, impressive infirmary meals, whatever scant literature I could find whenever the exhaustive toil of my body and the Essence treatments made my mind prioritize slumber. The furthest I see is the edge of this landscape. The entire city of the Afterlife looks like a porcelain chalice filled with white foam and wild berry mead, between the radiant azure roofs and polished marble walls, embellished with eaves of lustrous gold. The streets that wrap between the buildings are lined with raw granite, so perfectly flat as if nature intended it, reminiscent of the snow and ice these citizens only experience from a vast distance. And in the center, so many miles away where all the moisture of the basin congregates, is an island of glistening land where the tallest buildings rival the height of the outer rim.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s quite a walk,&quot; I say, and I&apos;m taken aback when one of my escorts takes offense.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Is that some kind of joke? You think people like us would waste our time on foot?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, not at all,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There. There&apos;s our ride. The Grandmaster sent for a touring car to take us there,&quot; he says. &quot;And that other guest is joining us, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The low hum of an engine crescendoes as a vehicle approaches. I can count on my hands how many times I&apos;ve had the privilege to ride in one of these cars: each time at the conclusion of a school year when Valentina&apos;s chauffeurs ferry us from the Academy to lavish parties at her estate: in the early years to protect us from danger, and in the later years to protect us from ourselves, preventing a dangerous, lonely, moonlit trek with half a handle of liquor. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s so lovely to see you up and about,&quot; Sylvia says. Driven from a barracks far more exorbitant than Merlot blood could ever dream of, she&apos;s taken the time to look her best. She leans against my shoulder as the motor hums to life once more, and I feel an odd and uncomfortably unrequited sense of stillness.</p>
<p>&emsp;It takes me a while to figure what&apos;s missing after the automobile departs from the curbside, and I feel that strange sensation of inertia in all directions like riding the swaying gondola from summit to ground. It&apos;s far unlike the train that starts where the gondola leaves off, traveling in a perfectly straight line. What&apos;s missing is how smooth the ride is &mdash; as if we glide across the ground on white rock softer than chalk, or maybe the springs of this great, pearlescent machine are tuned so precisely that any disturbance is ignored.</p>
<p>&emsp;It only gets warmer the closer we draw to the center, covering miles and miles in such a small span of minutes. They make fun of my captivation at the miracle of motion as if I were some kind of savage, throwing the word &apos;rustblood&apos; like Ullrich, yet I think they&apos;re insane to ever become used to this blessing. And Sylvia joins me in splendor. The silent rush of wind beyond the purr of the motorcar in the spaces when the driver lifts their foot from the accelerator and we descend on gravity alone into the basin; what it sounds like to be far from the eternal clockwork of industry in a land where their worship provides sustenance for all.</p>
<p>&emsp;The verdant grass loses the lifeless brown. Lush, leafy bushes explode with vibrant flowers, unafraid to show their colors when they&apos;re not fighting for the meager nutrients to survive, and my hand grazes the foliage I can reach on the side of the road. The island approaches as the ground runs flat in the bottom of the basin, reflecting a line of light in the peaks brighter than the golden eaves, boundlessly offered by the unsetting sun.</p>
<p>&emsp;For a while, I forget the conditions of my presence here, a tourist of these sights I never imagined beyond Everett&apos;s forbidden books, thinking them a fantasy. It&apos;s just as we slither around a switchback to face the place from whence we came that I notice the strangest sight, rubbing my eyes to try to reconcile the bending light. It&apos;s somewhere east of where we left, just over the rim, but still within the bounds of the Afterlife, distorting the air around it like the affects of a heated grill.</p>
<p>&emsp;I ask them what it is.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ll learn soon enough,&quot; he says. And quickly adds, &quot;when you&apos;ve been here for long enough, of course.</p>
<p>&emsp;The air condenses several degrees when we cross the bridge to the great island embellished with the finest buildings, looking so new though they hold that venerable beauty that only the most masterful craftsmen of history could ever create. I consider they must be the centers of worship where the selfless sacrifice of their time allows the Gods to provide sustenance for all, designed for the pleasure of a celestial eye that looks for reassurance of our eternal exaltation.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that I see the populace walking towards the central spires. What they wear is nothing like the vantablack threads of the Royal Guard: immaculately white in a way that boasts of how pristine and unadulterated their lives are, only colored by the precious jewelry and patterned colors, and for a while I feel that I should bow before them, undeserving of their slightest attention. Not a single one looks a day over middle age, their faces only creased by laugh lines that make it impossible to imagine a moment of sorrow, yet it feels as if each has lived for a hundred peaceful years.</p>
<p>&emsp;We pull up a couple hundred yards away from the central building I can only assume is either a political center, a house of holy worship, or both, with a square perimeter path of red stones spanning at least a quarter mile square. I can&apos;t resist imagining how many of the destitute families below could thrive in such an unused, well-manicured space, but I have to focus on the words I carry from the experience below: one of such pain that these smiling worshippers couldn&apos;t fathom to imagine. The azure spires cast peaks of shadow that stab into the grass, obscuring the sun, yet the central hall has so many windows etched into all sides of the marble that rectangles of magnified orange radiate the dewy fronds. The grass is so soft beneath my feet as we cut across the great yard with all the other finely-dressed acolytes raising the excitement of their peers. My entourage surrounds me closely as if I were either a guest of honor or a prisoner. Sylvia gets her space. And when I enter the main hall, I hear raucous shouts that sound like celebration, wondering if this is truly the event that Ullrich described to me.</p>
<p>&emsp;Unlike the flimsy stands of the Academy&apos;s auditorium where I gave my speech, there are sofas of box seats shaped in &quot;U&quot; formations that face towards the stage in the center, each grouping with an overstocked personal bar. But it&apos;s not just drinks. The succulent smell of the most delicious cuts of meat assault my senses, and I realize I&apos;ve never felt so hungry in my life. There is laughter, clanging golden chalices, and more red wine than all the blood shed by their lower subjects. I hear the voice of Ullrich in the speakers as I descend the stairs, omnipresent like the celestial beings that must have had a hand in sculpting this haven. There are so many people here. The closer I draw to the front, the more claustrophobic the crowding becomes, though the circle of guards part through the masses like a hot knife. They hardly give me any attention: despite how Ullrich dressed me, I only receive looks of disgust and contempt.</p>
<p>&emsp;Ullrich eyes me between words in his speech. They celebrate the survival of Blackwater, still alive after the massive Chymaeran offensive. There are cheers, laughter, and as many drunken-red faces as that of Vermillion Boulevard after exam week.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The next Golden Age approaches in only moments, after so many endless years we&apos;ve waited. The enemy of true-blooded Humans will finally pay their price. We will return!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;And at that, another great cheer echoes through the hall. Gold bracelets clatter. Crystal chalices raise with wine I imagine is older than Nordhaven. We set our chairs briefly in one of the boxes. Sylvia settles at the table, taking a long drink of wine. And when I approach the stage, I take my first full look out at the crowd. Candles adorn every table, and despite their high spirits, I consider this is still a vigil for the unwitting victims below&mdash;whom to these people must be far out of sight and mind.

<p>&emsp;The words leave my lips by their own volition. My emotions crescendo with the weight of my words. This is nothing like that soulless graduation speech. This time I speak not of future dreams and visions of success and camaraderie: those visions are the afterimage of a beautiful dream our lower people dreamt before the horrors of Endogeny. Wrapped in my words, I don&apos;t notice the expressions of the crowd. I&apos;m trying to stay afloat, on the edge of drowning in all the anxiety and sorrow, closing to this podium like a branch that will save my life.</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m afraid of what might happen to me if I stop talking. My eyes water when I think of their faces. Romin. Valentina. Ellie and my father, cherished family and friends I failed to protect. </p>
<p>&emsp;As longer pauses span between words, I am finally attentive to the crowd. They continue drinking and laughing, not paying any attention to what I have to say. These are stories of the real people that fell to the Chymaera to keep them alive, who haplessly took the brunt force of our common enemy.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Chymaera will pay for what they did. We all need to live on in their names,&quot; I say, and as I continue to speak on the courage of my comrades, the demeanor of the crowd is changing, as if they&apos;ve heard enough. When I use the words &quot;lower peoples&quot; and &quot;honor&quot; and &quot;sacrifice&quot; in the same string of sentences, their expressions grow sour.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They are the heroes. Never forget their names, as long as you all live, because&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, shut up, already!&quot; A heckler derails my train of thought. I consider I&apos;m hearing things, as if the thoughts in my head have been given a voice, but then it continues. &quot;They were meant to die.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;And then I realize their laughter wasn&apos;t in idle side chatter.</p>
<p>&emsp;They find this funny. My words are just another piece of entertainment for them.</p>
<p>&emsp;All the energy I have in sympathy dissolves wholly to unbridled anger. My tongue sharpens to a dagger on the grindstone of their ignorance.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why? Why do you laugh? We share a common enemy! Did we all die just so you could celebrate?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You died so we could live, you stupid rustblood!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Ullrich chimes in, then, from behind me. &quot;And here he is: one of the last pathetic bastards we found we beyond the walls.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The crowd laughs and jeers. I feel myself crumbling inwards in a visceral mix of terror, disbelief, and spite, because in this finite moment my soul is ungalvanized from the anguish, scratched away by the wear of sudden and immutable suffering, the rot spreads as a thousand years of rust.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Show us now! Show us what you have to say to the true enemy of the Humans.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s the Chymaera! I&apos;m not one of them, I swear,&quot; I say, pleading now. &quot;I&apos;m one of you!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m pelted in the chest by something that stings like rubber, and from the ruddy residue left on my clothes, I realize it&apos;s an entire cooked steak. A meal finer than I could ever provide for Ellie, something well-cooked I&apos;ve only eaten once or twice in my life.</p>
<p>&emsp;But Ullrich halts them. &quot;Not yet, people. You will get your chance,&quot; he says, &quot;as much as you wanted to see Endogeny cull the ones whose weakness led us here. Today we will make an example of the weak: the offspring of the rustbloods who let our people die!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The people jeer and cajole like caged animals, as if a century of ceaseless catering atop the great pedestal of Lionshead was a plight that could ever incite such anger. Ullrich smiles at the response he&apos;s cultivated. I can tell he looks forward to what comes next.</p>
<p>&emsp;The vision persists in my mind of all the people who wait for me on the other side of the Reservoir. Somewhere I&apos;m sure my sister has been reunited with my father. Romin and Valentina await my return. For a month I&apos;ve been forestalled from accepting the inevitability of the end.</p>
<p>&emsp;I won&apos;t go out a coward.</p>
<p>&emsp;I spring to action on feeble limbs, driving everything I have in one punch against Ullrich, and I catch him by surprise. My knuckles crack as they grind against his cheek, and the smile on my face crests to an ear-to-ear grin as I prepare to tell these spineless bastards the truth they refuse to hear, regardless of whether they accept it.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The people below are the real heroes of our people. All you will ever be known to history as are the parasites that leech off of true Humanity, the ones who enabled you!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The Royal Guard approach, armed to the teeth, but they don&apos;t raise their weapons, because they know another force can hurt me far more.</p>
<p>&emsp;I don&apos;t see the crystal chalice before it collides with my head: it blends too well with the reflections of jewelry and glass. My tongue stops dead in my mouth, still as cardstock and dry as paper. The taste of iron and the sensation of warmth are the last sensations I feel before time lapses and my head collides with the stage. They still insist on staying in the audience. Their clothes are far too disgustingly white to tarnish them with the streak of blood that scrapes in front of me. They fear all the matters of man that callous the hands and spread dirt on the palms, thinking themselves too clean to see the result of their murders. And thus the crystal chalice that likely fractured my skull came from no-one, just as the blame of unleashing Endogeny on the population can&apos;t fall on the blind.</p>
<p>&emsp;My adrenaline will last me long enough to speak my last words. I raise myself to my knees and prepare my vocal cords.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You all are murderers. You can incapacitate, curse out, and bludgeon me, but you can never remove the weight of the ultimate truth, and you all will die with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that Ullrich grabs me. &quot;I want you to know it was nothing personal,&quot; he whispers, before driving his knee into my stomach, letting me keel over in the absence of breath. &quot;When I let your father die. Those Chymaerans that you inferior people fear are the ones that stand with us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My limbs refuse to lift me from the stage. I had just enough strength to speak and just enough fury to attack him once. My vision falters when I look to the box seats where Sylvia sits, squinting to see if I can find those crimson eyes before I&apos;m stoned with artifacts finer than anything Clint&apos;s shop could ever sell; before the refined barbarism of these godless adherents ends me. All I know is that she is there. She covers her eyes of the sight though she convulses with sobs, too timid and afraid to watch me dying.</p>
There is nothing left for me here. But Ullrich doesn&apos;t want me to die. Between the cheers of this congregation, he makes his pronouncement: &quot;This rustblood, and the other two prisoners, will be saved for later. Endogeny will finish its liquidation of the last stragglers in merely a day, and these will be the last to fall to the tar. Tomorrow begins the rise of the pure-blooded Mask, the Heiress of Purgatory, whose divinity spans two races. She toils deep within the heart of this mountain to train and raise an army of the worthy. With the new golden age of the Humans only a sunset away, we will rise and reclaim Nordhaven, and all the lands beyond the frost!&quot;"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":37,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":17,"ChapterFull":18,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":37,"Index":57,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"55","Synopsis":"","Summary":"[ 01/2024 ]  Arrive at first floor of the Undercroft, kept with Lyra and Raine.

<p>&emsp;So little I remembered of the trip to the dungeon: only two similarities and a difference. First, it was the same escorts surrounding me just as closely as they did before, without the pleasantries of a word. Second, it was the same car that took me there, leading me to an understanding that this was the plan the whole time.</p>
<p>&emsp;The only difference is the feeling of betrayal I could never imagine: to have my understandings of this people transition from lauded selflessness to utter disgust; to have all those formative years in Seminary I learned songs of admiration and worship to mean absolutely nothing; only certain of the presence of divinity by that inexplicable column of crimson light in my dead father&apos;s shop that precipitated all of this.</p>
<p>&emsp;We drew closer and closer to that anomalous mirage of bending light on the horizon, just over the rim, and when we finally made it to the precipice, I saw the endless stretch of warehouses, segregated by rail lines fanning like capillaries from a vein of something critical being distributed around the city. Nearest to the northeast near Province Nine, I could see that one of them leads to a depot where I can only imagine a lift carries those resources down.</p>
<p>&emsp;Darkness consumed the open-topped touring car after we descended between the span of warehouses. It&apos;s a wide tunnel with two rail lines on either side. I felt a nausea crescendo the closer we drew to the light at the end, as if my body was being compressed and stretched against its own matter though it holds the same volume. The guards held their noses, ducked their heads, and closed their eyes as if they felt it a thousand times before. But with my eyes wide open, the shrinking world behind us took on a distinct shade of blue as if  our eyes were adjusting from candlelight, though this long tunnel is darker than sin. There was no fire to precipitate the sensation of heat, or the glowing motes passing us that shift from blood red to yellow to white to cerulean to deep indigo, giving off no ambient light. Ahead, the grand skylit chamber looked as if it were set ablaze, redder than the sky when Everett&apos;s trade house burned with the children inside, minus the ash and smoke. The colors saturated stronger with acceleration, the sensation of all my matter being pulled from the front and back and squeezed on every side, until finally we came to a stop at the threshold of a vast chamber, bathed once more in pure white light from wide openings above.</p>
<p>&emsp;Now they escort me from the automobile, depriving me of all my possessions. Parting with my mother&apos;s necklace means so little now that there is no one else left to remember her. They strip me of the fine-woven uniform, giving me the only sullied linen outfit I&apos;m convinced exists in this puritan bubble &mdash; that is, until I pass the room filled with thousands of the same, lightly tinged with dried blood that couldn&apos;t have been cleansed in the meager seconds each of these were cleaned.</p>
<p>&emsp;The cloth feels older than humanity itself. When my fingertips graze the tears in the fabric, I realize they&apos;re not the frayed, soft contours of holes made from wear, but from something sharp that sliced the threads and the meat behind it. A residue of fine particulate garnishes my fingers, and I find it&apos;s from the fabric itself: so old that the smallest fragments of the fiber lack the strength to adhere together, and if I dressed any more aggressively, the outfit might have turned to dust.</p>
<p>&emsp;I think it is glass that accents the entire outside of this dome, so great it might be able to cover the entire Academy of Province Twelve, but it&apos;s something else. No way that glass could ever be curved so precisely absent the scratches, over such a vast surface, and when I look closer, it looks like a shaded membrane of some gas that doesn&apos;t like being crushed. Maybe that entire experience in the tunnel spans only a couple feet up there: unsurvivable by even the celestials, and when I hear something crash to the ground in front of me, I find the only other sign of life at my feet. It&apos;s a cardinal: flushed with vibrant feathers on its right side as if it died only seconds ago. The midsection is bare, stripped to rotting meat as if the decay of weeks had taken hold of it. And on the left, there is nothing left but the bones that once held the structure of the wings.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Keep moving,&quot; my entourage beckons: the first words they&apos;ve said since they dragged me from the hall. We march through another tunnel lit in patterned rectangles of light from above, and I come to understand that there are three of these monolithic chambers in a triangle joined by the halls. Something divinely powerful and older than the rocks of this planet rumbles below. It sounds like voices, like entire conversations spoken in seconds, the sound of tools of both violence and labor. Though I can&apos;t see past the threshold of the overlook, I know it&apos;s there to afford light to whatever survives beneath, probably spanning deeper than the height of the frostbitten ground at the foothills of this vast mountain.</p>
<p>&emsp;We descend a set of stone stairs, and the light is ever-so-slightly saturated in blues and reds once again. I hold my nose and close my eyes or else I might vomit, led by the guards and my grasp of the guardrail until there&apos;s no more steps etched in the stone. The cells were recently vacated: I can tell from the sight of half-consumed produce and meat without the yellowed decay or smell of rot, and it&apos;s when I hear the shouting that I realize I&apos;m being led to the other two unfortunate prisoners.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;This is all your fault! I told you over and over that the debt we amassed for being out there &mdash; for holding to that pathetic, imaginary sense of self-congratulatory purpose &mdash; would come due. That it would result in this if we didn&apos;t try. The collapse of everything. And all we did was fucking watch!&quot; The young woman says</p>
<p>&emsp;They don&apos;t even notice at first when the steel-barred door hinges open, creaking on centuries of rust, and I&apos;m ushered into the cell. The massive dark-skinned man dressed in aged robes of the Carmine bows his head as he crumples in the corner. The carved stone is dark in splotches beneath his head, and I realize that he must be crying. He wipes his gray beard of the mucus that collected there, still refusing to deposit it on his robes though he&apos;s been stripped of all his honor.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And we call ourselves the First Red? The ones that staked our whole lives on planning a return, on liberating our own flesh and blood that were raised to die? The ones that are already dead? Those vaults in all the compounds are still full: full of all the implements we needed to at least fucking try, Raine!&quot; She shouts. When she withdraws the hood of her own Carmine fabrics, her back turned to me, I recognize this anger is only half of her raw display of emotion. Behind the dark-brown braid that spans from behind her head to the front of her right shoulder, she weeps harder than the man called Raine squatting in the corner.</p>
<p>&emsp;Raine&apos;s voice is deep and remorseful. &quot;I understand, Lyra. I understand your grief, and I&apos;m aware . . . of our failure . . . &quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Trapped in the very chambers their weakest young are sent to toil, to train . . . kids no older than I look that come out beyond recognition, if they ever leave. And can you believe this place was once a blessing? A Divine Wish by a Chosen Mask to afford a boundless source of sustenance with meager sacrifice of every living person? Bastardized for war and imbalance?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m hesitant to speak so I just stand there. All that&apos;s left is to bide time before whatever fate approaches, and I&apos;ve resigned myself to it.</p>
<p>&emsp;The girl called Lyra slumps in the other corner. Her hazel, bloodshot eyes briefly meet mine before settling on the floor, letting seconds pass before she offers so much as a word. &quot;And what makes you so important to them?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No idea. I was good at the Academy. That&apos;s about all I ever was.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I ramble on with recent events. My voice is better background noise than the rumble of whatever churns beneath us, and with my aching body devoid of any peace to bring me to sleep, I spill everything to try to find the slightest sliver of catharsis.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And so I lost everything. My father. My sister. My fireteam. And now the person most special to me. She couldn&apos;t even watch when I stood up for myself,&quot; I tell them.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Family was a sacrifice for all of us. We&apos;ll be joining them in the Reservoir soon enough,&quot; Raine says. &quot;I gave up my family to act as a liaison for the Carmine of my Province. I thought it was for the better. To prepare. To return and save our own race, but we became so&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Complacent. Pathetic. Self-gratifying over an unkept promise, tugging yourselves off to your own glory,&quot; Lyra says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know that,&quot; Raine says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Your own family,&quot; I ask, &quot;are they dead?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I have no way to know. All I know is that my children think their mother and I am. It had to be airtight. When the last elder passed and the opportunity arose, I was next in line, and it had to be unquestionable, no paperwork or trail leading back, or else the Afterlife would smite us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Lyra adds, &quot;And all that was&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, Lyra,&quot; Raine says. &quot;It was all for nothing in the end.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Water drips somewhere beyond the cell. The faintest light from the grand central dome reaches the walls by the stairwell, merely a reflection of a reflection of sunlight in the dark hollow, the only evidence of a world beyond this space.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what of you?&quot; I ask Lyra.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve been running of the fumes of a stupid hope that once filled me with purpose,&quot; she says. &quot;My father betrayed our own people. My mother died early. And my older brother put himself in danger to save me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He gave his life. There&apos;s no denying it,&quot; Raine says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I still refuse to believe that,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;His grave was empty. Before I ever left the Afterlife to join the mission of the First Red, I visited that place beyond the walls again and again, but one day it was empty.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But that means nothing,&quot; Raine says, savoring a sense of revenge for the poison of her past words. They both rise to their feet. &quot;A shallow grave? Maybe his limbs were picked apart by hungry, desperate wolves with the claws to dig. Maybe Snowdrifters exhumed his body for any precious accessories they could steal.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s not a chance!&quot; Lyra says. She drives her fist against him with all the intention of a powerful blow, but his chest is no different in hardness than the three stone walls surrounding us. </p>
<p>&emsp;Lyra crumples. It was all the strength she had.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know he&apos;s out there. Or he was. I just know my father was hiding something, that Everett was hiding something, that it would be impossible for a child of cross-raced, pure-blooded strength of royalty to be allowed to die so fruitlessly. That column of crimson light was proof of it!&quot; she says. &quot;He was going to be the next Mask of the Gods. Now all we have is this impostor . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The curiosity of the name outweighs my helplessness, so I stop her rambling. &quot;Everett?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;My uncle. The pathetic weakling that forced my brother&apos;s hand. The one that locked us out of the only safe place we could separate ourselves from those marauders guising as Snowdrifters.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;My grandfather was once called Everett,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not a surprise to be named after one of the royal children of Nordhaven,&quot; she says. &quot;My Everett was the original. And my father was his older brother: the one that leads this holocaust. You know him as the Grandmaster.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What? So Ullrich is your father?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He disowned me when I stood up for the very people he once swore to protect,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;When he returned to the scene of bloodshed and my dying brother, something changed inside of him forever. It was almost too quick a change to believe, as if he were weathered by a thousand lifetimes in a few seconds. And, by the Gods how he loathed Everett: that lonely, pathetic coward insisting he was protecting what those intruders came for, more valuable than either of our lives. I&apos;m glad he had no children to carry the weakness of his blood. And I&apos;m glad he spent the rest of his life regretting that choice...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well. My Everett had a son that he ignored, and his offspring did the same to me,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Good for you,&quot; she mutters. A couple seconds of dripping water pass the time before she opens her mouth again. &quot;I&apos;m sorry. I didn&apos;t mean that. It&apos;s just &mdash; none of this really matters anymore. There&apos;s nothing left to fight for: nothing left to save. All that&apos;s left is to watch that other cross-blooded monster take the birthright of my brother. Maybe father made another one since I didn&apos;t have the right blood for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And why is this &apos;mask&apos; so damn important, worth massacring for?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, what would you do to harness the power of the Gods, if it meant fixing something that was taken from you? There&apos;s no going back for him. Not to the innocent child he buried over his negligence. Not to the daughter he disowned because his grief was stronger than his love. Not to when Nordhaven  fell to the Chymaera a hundred and fifty years ago when he was a young man, when his own people escaped to the north, extinguished of all their Essence, rendered powerless from the loss of generations of Essence accumulation. Maybe he thinks he can get even with fate, maybe he&apos;s convinced himself that he&apos;s earned it,&quot; she rambles.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Is he going to get it?&quot; I ask.</p>
&quot;Not a chance. No outcome is ever going to be enough.&quot;"},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Liquidation","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Eighteen","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Nineteen","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":18,"ChapterFull":19,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":58,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"56","Synopsis":"May their souls find rest in the Reservoir.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.19","Links":{"Wattpad":"https://www.wattpad.com/user/SavantGuarde","Personal":"https://autononymous.io/authors-and-stories/savantguarde/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand/firebrand-1-18","RoyalRoad":"https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/109661/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand-book-one","AO3":"https://archiveofourown.org/works/63835228/chapters/164389954","DeviantArt":"https://www.deviantart.com/savant-guarde"},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

<p>&emsp;We bide the passage of time in our own ways. Raine and Lyra pray to Khiras for the courage to face death, while I spend hours wondering why this sensation feels so familiar. I don&apos;t find out until I stare at the ceiling, looking for familiar cracks by habit, as if I brought myself to this place on my own accord, just like I did so many nights before. The only difference is that there&apos;s no window to open to let the cold air fill the room.</p>
<p>&emsp;All I have to measure time is the seven trips to the latrine afforded by the guards: little more than a pit dug deep into the earth, rancid with the waste of an uncountable number of people before me. The food is enough: rather than divine praise bringing bushels of produce from the sky or however the lower peoples imagined it, it came from the very ground, and this place is unquestionably the everflowing source of it.</p>
<p>&emsp;It feels so much longer than the day that Ullrich proclaimed. I find sleep when it&apos;s forced out of me. That reflection of a reflection of sunlight on the far stairwell wall turns dark only once. There&apos;s little conversation between the three of us, since the only commonality is that we&apos;re trapped together. Occasionally we&apos;ll sleep with our backs to each other, or all sprawled against the bare wall with heads on shoulders: our flesh the only softness that exists in the cell beyond the thin fabrics we wear. But by the time our detention expires, it all feels like it was only a matter of hours.</p>
<p>&emsp;The sound of footsteps builds in the stairwell, along with the sound of voices: going up, not down. Neither of us can catch a glance at any of them: at least a dozen, ushered by a single tall figure with silken blonde hair.  They wear the same threads I wore for the celebration, yet they&apos;re not polished enough in their speech or cadence to be seasoned guards. I almost think I recognize a couple of their voices. Then I just consider it&apos;s a panicked mind longing for connection with anyone I&apos;ve seen before.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It must be time,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Time for us to go. To pay for the sin of valuing our fellow man over progress,&quot; Raine says. &quot;The only sin I bring to this death is being too late to try to save them.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;And then the freezing gale engulfs the cell. It brings me back to the night I lost my father, when the sister I cherished was ripped from his arms, when my blood was so cold that I couldn&apos;t urge my muscles to move. I shiver in the fear and grief. The others tremble, but not from the cold: itching their skin, panicked at something else that seems more horrifying than any imaginations of death could ever conjure.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Raine, do you feel that?&quot; Lyra says.</p>
<p>&emsp;The hardy Raine&apos;s voice trembles. &quot;The power. Not by generations or by nature, but by something far, far worse . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My body freezes like it did when I confronted the Chymaerans for the first time. My hands refuse to hinge. Even the thoughtless beat of my heart slows to a painful slosh of clotting blood, and when the obsidian-clad, tall, flaxen-haired woman passes the threshold of the leftmost wall, her amethyst eyes pierce deeper than the blade that killed my father.</p>
<p>&emsp;Spiderwebs of purple spread across our flesh like an allergic reaction to wind. It brings me straight back to Everett in the final years of his life when he lost his mind to the Chymaeran Curse, and part of me thinks it will end this way, before I remember it&apos;s not climactic enough for Ullrich.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You will follow me,&quot; she beckons. &quot;Your body won&apos;t give you a choice.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She unlocks the door, and we follow her up the stairs. The resistance of any muscle undedicated to putting one foot in front of the other causes a strain like growing pains. And it&apos;s when we make it to the top of the stairs that I see all the others that lived far beneath the ground.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus? Is that you?&quot; A voice says. It comes from a face I can&apos;t reconcile: just a little too old to be a colleague from the academy. Or is it?</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s really him. The Valedictorian.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of what class?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The last one.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I never saw him in the trials.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He was the top of the class! Of course his fireteam wouldn&apos;t have suffered through that. They were special enough to serve.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why don&apos;t you give us another rousing speech?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I open my mouth to reply. All I manage is a squeak before the obsidian pain reclaims my wasted energy towards walking to the touring car at the mouth of the tunnel, and I find my head turn forwards and down toward my feet.</p>
<p>&emsp;The last trip passes in pain and resignation, while the other two passed in astonishment and betrayal. I find humor that I can brag I&apos;ve taken more car rides than I can count on my fingers now, but there&apos;s no one left to listen. All the acolytes are gathered once more for the final event before the transition of some prophesied golden age, and it seems we&apos;ve been reduced to just another entertaining sideshow. They&apos;d be throwing quartz and pouring their expensive liquor on us if it weren&apos;t for the fine craftsmanship of this automobile. Across from me, the blonde champion stares into my eyes while I refuse her glare, the only thing left I can resist. And before long, they usher us to the front of a makeshift pit unearthed in the park outside of the grand central hall, surrounded by watchers that ravenously feed off every ounce of our desperation.</p>
<p>&emsp;The hate we witness is unfathomable. The three of us, redressed in tattered rags of worse quality than the furthest outwallers, are cajoled with all the ruthless anger and hatred of the weakness that brought our race to its knees, forcing us to seek refuge north of Nordhaven in Blackwater. We&apos;re free game for the clods of dirt and pebbles when we&apos;re far enough away from the automobile, still forced to walk by that deathly, otherworldly force. Eventually we fall to our knees in front of the pit, our backs turned to the pulsating remnants of Endogeny, its putrid smell of unsettled flesh wholly overridden by the sweet smell of honey mead and venison. It takes all the will we have to prevent gravity and the weakness of the curse from pulling us into the pit.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s finally now that I can see the leaders of this regime, seated directly in front of us. I don&apos;t recognize any of them, though I&apos;m sure none of their cattle would ever be important enough to know.   What do pigs and cows know of their masters beyond the hand and sickle? What use is a name when overwhelming power makes the boldest pronouncement? My heart races with that innate, animalistic sense of adrenaline that begs me to survive at any cost although my mind has resigned itself to this inevitable end.</p>
<p>&emsp;The nameless king beckons for Ullrich to end the campaign he began so long ago. Ullrich and his vassal for the power of the Gods assemble directly before us, and behind, the unrecognizable cadets in obsidian fatigues flank the pit.</p>
<p>&emsp;I hear the king speak for the first time. Like any leader worth their weight in needless gold, he tells a story they&apos;ve heard a hundred times before that gets far more hyperbolic and exciting with every telling. &quot;A hundred and fifty years have passed since the fall of Nordhaven. Our capital city was the shining beacon for the future of Humans. But the coalition of forces led by the Chymaeran separatists nearly extinguished our people. Most of you probably remember running for your lives. You are the ones whose strength allowed them to hold on to the Essence of generations. The weak were mostly extinguished, drained of their Essence by our enemies: few of them following our retreat like moths to flame, clambering north through the snow with their meager Essence, keeping the fortunate warm enough to survive the trek alone, leaving more frosthards than powerless swine.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Their weakness damned us!&quot; One of the adherents shouts.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So we overtook Blackwater. In a hundred years we expanded it from a fledgling city of a hundred thousand into a new capital that forgot everything of its past. We shaped the filth and brine into a system that would work for us. Instead of the mild climate wasted on all the peasants across the land, we consolidated such power that the jungles of the Verdalans and Ahkvasans could grow atop a barren summit three miles high. And we forced the pigs below to produce the power and smoke that would keep them warm. We filled the troughs through the labor of their own people. Gave them all the conditions to fornicate and produce as many bodies they could to slowly trickle with the generational crescendo of Essence. And now, at the end of our long winter, and at the threshold of our long-awaited return, we herald a new Mask, a new vassal to carry our forces to Blackwater and everywhere beyond!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The king steps down from his portable throne to re-introduce the new ruler of their armies and his leading general. He introduces the cadets behind us as &apos;rustbloods that have proved their ruthlessness enough to die for our causes.&apos; I watch as Lyra and Raine tremble to the left and right of me, light of the curse as their champion waits to extinguish us at the most enjoyable time.</p>
<p>&emsp;I hear my name somewhere between the cheers. I twist my head as left as it can muster: it&apos;s Sylvia, awash with that eternal look of fear and weakness that has followed her since our earliest years together in the orphanage. She is powerless as ever, just a spectator to the death of a man that once protected her, that might have even said that he loved her, but in all my affection for her, I can&apos;t find a shred of anger.</p>
<p>&emsp;I still feel the snag of attachment, like a thread, bonding me to this world, and the more I see it, the more furious I become. It&apos;s the feeling of something more than duty. For the entirety of this life I could accept that the world was just unfair, that I deserved nothing and got whatever came to me, whether good or bad. </p>
<p>&emsp;But instead of the stillness I thought would come with fulfillment of duty, it&apos;s a pain of loneliness and fear.</p>
<p>&emsp;I regret. </p>
<p>&emsp;And those words of emotion terrify me before I can withhold them.</p>
<p>&emsp;This entire life has all been a waste. And then the longing overtakes me. That despite the anger and fear, how badly I wish to be safe in the warmth of her embrace, rather than feeling the heat leave my body and fall into the now vacant pit behind me.</p>
<p>&emsp;How I should have listened. How I should have opened the door to my father. How I should have spent more time with Ellie. Gods! How could I have been so selfish to keep her? How could I ever be good enough for her, to render her life an eternal nightmare because I didn&apos;t have the strength to let go!</p>
<p>&emsp;I muster a smile at Sylvia as Ullrich makes his presence, hoping just this once that actions can speak for the words that, despite everything, I had yet to tell her. And one last time, I can forgive her as she vanishes into the crowd, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>&emsp;Ullrich says, &quot;It took the royalty everything to convince me to join their effort. I was opposed at first. But it was the loss of my own child . . . the loss of my two children, rather, that showed me the true importance of this crusade. They taught me the definition of sacrifice&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Fucking rat bastard,&quot; Lyra manages. &quot;Even killing your child is all about you, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;and as I stand here faced with the face of my daughter, I can tell you that this is a reminder of the strength it takes for us to let go of that past. To forgive the weak for their sins. And to give them a quick and painless death so that the ones that matter can forge on. Besides the weak-blooded daughter, I once had a son that would carry the pride of our blood. But now, I have a true daughter,&quot; he says, placing his hands upon the shoulders of the Mask. &quot;And now, for the first time in a century and a half, we will make our triumphant return!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I hear Lyra unleash a bloodcurdling scream when the Mask is distracted: just enough strength in her body to do one last thing.</p>
<p>&emsp;She manages little more than a couple steps before the Mask casts spiderwebs of amethyst upon her. Ullrich extends his hand to grab her throat and lifts her in the air.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You can stop that,&quot; he tells the Mask. &quot;This is something I have to handle on my own.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, Lyra!&quot; Raine manages. And so the Mask focuses all Lyra&apos;s suffering on him, causing him to tremble hard enough that he begins to slide down the muddy pit.</p>
<p>&emsp;I can only watch as he suspends Lyra over the pit while she&apos;s at full strength. It takes Raine all the resilience he has to draw the effort into his powerful muscles to propel himself to his feet. With his arms outstretched, he tackles Ullrich into the pit along with his daughter.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m coming, Fletcher.&quot; The name of her brother is the last words that crest Lyra&apos;s lips.</p>
<p>&emsp;The onlookers are mortified. Only the king and queen, and all the rest of the royalty, remain in their seats unaffected by the turn of events. And when I hear the sudden turn of the spectators, as if this were some Academy wrestling match in the fields, Ullrich ascends from Endogeny entirely intact.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The strong will always prevail. The weak will always be left behind,&quot; he says, as he returns to his place in front of me, dropping whatever&apos;s left of their skulls upon the ground. &quot;And it is the Essence in our circuits that divides us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He calls to the Mask, handing something to her from within his pocket, and I recognize it as soon as she places it around her neck. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The first cross-blooded Mask of the Gods to come to this world. Raised on the blood and sacrifice of the rustbloods,&quot; Ullrich says, raising the necklace to show a single shimmering fragment. &quot;Between the divine blood of the Chymaera and the Humans, she will be known as the Heiress of Purgatory!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Despite my vision, I instantly recognize it, glowing red as it approaches her: the piece of Pure Essence in the amulet I found beyond the walls. And on the fumes of a dying mind, I realize what I had been missing the whole time.</p>
<p>&emsp;The Merlot never stole it. The Carmine never kept it. It was the Afterlife that took the pure-Essenced Amulet to use it as a catalyst for this godless metamorphosis.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It is time to withdraw the great weapon Endogeny. It has served its purpose,&quot; he says, and as the Mask closes her eyes to meditate on the celestial power, I can only watch as it dissolves, assimilated wholly with her circuits.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that a radiant heat bathes the outer lands in cleansing light. Particles of crimson Essence lift from millions of dead, disintegrating Humans, floating in the air like paper lanterns at light against the eternal dawn. The liquidous void surrounding their island capital saturates with motes of amber, rising as bubbles from something dissolving far below, higher than the steeples and spires of the central hall. And like an infinite blanket of stars, they glow on the light of a state a lifetime past. </p>
<p>&emsp;I have no tears left to weep at the disregard of their sacrifice. I&apos;ve sweated out every last fluid in my body, and I hold on to the meager moments I have before I press on to the veil of the Reservoir. The motes gravitate towards the undeserving acolytes of this godless regime, and they stretch their hands like joyful children, absorbing whatever stolen sparks they can as their flux consolidates on the Mask, saturating her with unspeakable power. </p>
<p>&emsp;But their triumphant elation ends as soon as the Essence hangs in the air, like a room of dust in bright sunlight. There&apos;s something else that drains the electricity from the air, and when the motes begin to flow away from the Heiress, past my body to a space behind me, they begin to panic. </p>
It&apos;s only when the process reverses that their screams pierce the air, casting them to the ground, actively losing something precious to them for the first time in their effortless lives. Because their long-separated Gods had forsaken them, they tried to create their own. They thought they could create an Afterlife greater than the Gods. And now I finally get my catharsis when the Essence peels from their circuits.

<p>&emsp;The upper plateau is eviscerated by an ever-widening column of light, and in the unholy matrimony between opposing elements of life and death, not even dust survives. The column pours into a flat, widening reservoir bounded by the dense clouds, and when I look up, I watch its reverse waterfall collect in a shadowed lake, and it&apos;s as if I see the reflection of another world.</p>
<p>&emsp;The dead Essence attracts to somewhere in the crowd like ferric dust to a magnet, growing in magnitude until it&apos;s unmistakable, and everyone turns to watch. They have no idea of the unholy retribution that awaits them. Ullrich begins to panic. He never could have predicted this: how the tables have turned. </p>
<p>&emsp;A trail of Essence now feeds my circuits, such an uncomfortable feeling that I fall into the empty pit, my head pointed upwards to try and catch an upside-down glimpse of whatever opponent dares to oppose the will of the Afterlife. All the motes are now condensed to a single stream, inundating one of the observers with unexplainable power. Their eyes resonate with the darkest color of blood as they float above us. Their flesh becomes white-hot fire. And in an instant, the godless bastards of the Afterlife experience powerlessness for the first time in their lives.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;This pocket of humanity will pay an unpardonable price for all it has taken!  It is the will of the Gods.&quot; The voice is omnipresent as if whispered in every ear. I can feel the Essence oversaturate the air, stirring around like a cup of tea with so much sugar it refuses to dissolve. But something else dissolves instead. It&apos;s not just their circuits being stripped of Essence now: the flesh of all the denizens of the Afterlife begins to wither. The trail of Essence that once saturated their circuits like the fat in their arteries draws from them, and they face a fate far worse than the true Humans they sentenced to death by Endogeny.</p>
<p>&emsp;Soon they all lie motionless, atrophied of every last fiber of muscle, rendered as nothing but flesh-covered skeletons cursed with consciousness, forced to lie in their last crumpled state until starvation or thirst might claim them, left motionless by the vengeance of hubris. Even my strength is unparalleled compared to theirs. The corpses lie unblinking but conscious: like plants, a permanent installation of nature no longer privileged with the power of mobility.</p>
<p>&emsp;The only evidence of life I can see stands just beyond the stage, bathed in blinding luminosity. The inverted puddle of pure Essence now glows brighter than the distant sun can muster, and all that remains is the same texture of grief and sorrow that I harbor over the waste of it all.</p>
<p>&emsp;Her voice booms like thunder. The blasphemers who thought they could reach beyond the Gods come down to their knees.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let this be a final lesson, unworthy renegades, those who murder brothers and sisters in thoughtless avarice to taste the power of the Gods: all you will ever find is the emptiness of hollow, agonizing death, no longer welcome to the flesh that makes you Human.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Although they have all committed an atrocity so horrible, it pains the Goddess to watch as they lie there, motionless, pleading to be vanquished. She begins to weep as her tremendous form crests the clouds, and when I try my muscles, I realize my life has been spared. The ground shakes. I feel the stirring of something far beneath the earth as my body is tossed about the ground like sizzling drips of oil on a hot plate. The bodies of the motionless living rise to that shimmering portal. It is the Reservoir: the true afterlife, to show them in their last moments they could never create something greater than the forces of divinity.</p>
<p>&emsp;My hand reaches for that rapturous, otherworldly portal of shimmering Essence: the true Afterlife. I don&apos;t float like the rest of them, and I plead with tearless eyes. &quot;Let me go. Please, let me go! Let me go home and see them! Please,&quot; I continually plead, but that buoyant force never reaches me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel the ground tremble beneath me as Khiras&apos; footsteps shake the ground. She had found the last Human amongst the wreckage. She has found me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel the ground beneath me liquefy as I ascend higher than the mountains, higher than the clouds, a whole chunk of the earth held between her hands, ten-ton boulders sifting through her fingers like sand. All I can see is the Goddess&apos; eyes as she watches me, her head eclipsing the moon in shape and light, and it feels as if her radiance casts the entire landscape into eternal lighttime.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m so sorry,&quot; I whimper, &quot;I&apos;m so weak, and powerless, and...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The glow of Khiras&apos; crimson eyes well to the shape of pity. The tears finally pour from my eyes, this has all been too much to hold, and I just cry there, for Sylvia, for Valentina, for Romin, for Vera, for Viktor and Isla, for all the ones whose lives were extinguished in the campaign.</p>
<p>&emsp;The goddess&apos; eyes well with magma. Scalding tears pour from her eyes as she sinks to her knees, and I feel a radiant embrace of heat as if it covers me entirely: the Goddess tenderly holding her last living child.</p>
<p>&emsp;Humanity&apos;s last foothold has been extinguished. The blood of eons has been severed. No longer will there exist a mortal of her image to indulge her with songs of worship.</p>
<p>&emsp;All I can see in my mind&apos;s eye are the faces of all the people I&apos;ve ever loved waiting for me now. I try to recall my mother&apos;s face; the shape and warmth of Ellie&apos;s gentle form when I embraced her; the voice of each of my friends.</p>
<p>&emsp;Her wailing cries shake the ground as she holds the entire island to her chest, and from beneath her, magma launches from deep beneath the crust, consuming the grounds of Blackwater in superheated rock, purging the surface of every last impurity as if to start over and plant me in the soil. But I can tell that even the Goddess has given up.</p>
<p>&emsp;Hot ashen clouds consume the surface; the shape of everything solidified in soot and stone; the last record of the Humans frozen in time for all eternity; my home reduced to a single timeless frame if it couldn&apos;t live on with the power of life. The clouds approach closer, but she doesn&apos;t raise her hands to save me: I can feel the scorching heat begin to sear my nerves until soon I can&apos;t feel anything at all.</p>
<p>&emsp;Before my vision melts away, the last sight in my mind&apos;s eye is the crimson glare of the Goddess staring directly at me, before the scalding ash eviscerates the flesh from my body, and I&apos;m tugged by the wrist in a direction beyond space, leaving the irreversible bedlam of this dead reality behind.</p>
<p>&emsp;In the next frame of consciousness I lie awake and alive. The hazy ash trades for a textured ceiling I&apos;ve seen too many times to count, and the scalding heat trades for freezing night air.</p>
But the crimson eyes are persistent. They look down on me with concern as I panic, choking on smoke that no longer burns my lungs."},{"DocType":"Act","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":"","AutoNameFull":"ACT III","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":"","ChapterFull":"","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":61,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"59","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"Act Two","Body":""},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Premonition","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;One","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Twenty","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":1,"ChapterFull":20,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":62,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"59","Synopsis":"The thread says that none of this was ever a dream.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.20","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

I can predict her words before they cross her lips. It feels like weeks since I last heard them.
&quot;I want you to know that I&apos;m always watching you, ever since the orphanage, ever since you saved me from it,&quot; she says. &quot;Ever since you showed me that kindness, you know, because . . .&quot;
I try to reach inside this past self, but it&apos;s like grabbing a stray branch on the banks of a blistering river. Moving my mouth and manipulating my mind are like running in a dream.
This Titus stutters. He grasps his head. I&apos;m not quite there yet, but I plant the words. I can feel myself getting closer.
&quot;Because you love me,&quot; he says, and his response surprises him. They&apos;re not his words yet. The bastard wants to run just like he always does, but as I leech in and take control, I can feel all the faculties of sense and sentiment come back to me. 
She looks for the same three words to cross his lips. He doesn&apos;t know this is truly the last chance for him to exchange anything meaningful, and he&apos;s still too afraid of the concept of slowing down&mdash;I know, because I still can&apos;t do it it either.
I fight for control. And given a brain again instead of a timeless soul, the physical memory of all those horrors return to me. They flood my circuits. I lose all the objectivity of a phantom swept through time.
It all comes back to me. It scalds in the threads on my wrist. And somewhere down the line of this thread, I can hear the frequency of Lyra&apos;s dying words; feel all the hard parts of myself obliterated with the crushing weight of earthen rock; the gasping atrophy of lungs extinguished of air and filled with soot; the dreams of water; that cursed thread dragging me towards an end beyond space. The thread was crimson like the blood of my dying father. And I can still feel it there on my wrist, scalding when I look down.
My body crushes inwards on heaving lungs. Continuity returns from the last exact moment my mind bore witness. My throat aches in flames that no longer burn. Her crimson glare terrifies me as I scramble for the furthest wall, choking on fresh air, eyes wet and wide as it feels my flesh is melting from my body.
I scream when my back jostles against the windowsill and I run out of space. I bash over the table as if it could ever protect me from her divine power. Clouds of dust filter through lamplight ribbons. And as motes from abandoned tabletops violate my nostrils, the sensation of scalding and fits of coughing only grow sharper.
She sits on the bed, staring at me just like I last saw her: panicked and afraid, without explanation for the sudden stir of panic. All she hoped for was the utterance of three small words.
&quot;Let me go, Khiras, please,&quot; I beg to her, heaving for breaths between syllables, knowing she&apos;s just going to give up on everything again, just like she promised. The shell of the Goddess twists her body to put her feet on the floor, still wearing Valentina&apos;s dress from the party.
&quot;What in Khiras&apos; name are you on about?&quot; Sylvia asks, frightened and clueless. I flinch when she approaches me, just like she flinched in the orphanage any time I put my hand on her shoulder.
&quot;J-just a nightmare,&quot; I tell her. I try to control my breaths, but my voice still rattles.
She gets down on her knees. Her silken, disheveled hair absorbs the light as her calm eyes try to relax me, but I still cling to the terror of that last image, the Goddess towering over me as she promised I&apos;d live everything all over again.
My back is flat, my head tipped against the corner of the floor and the wall when she crawls over me, sitting on my waist with her knees bent.
&quot;You had a night terror. It&apos;s okay. I&apos;ve been having them ever since Graduation, just thinking about what awaits us out there,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;Please. Come back to bed and sleep with me. I&apos;ll take care of you.&quot;
Maybe she&apos;s been hiding it the whole time. Or maybe she just doesn&apos;t know.
&quot;What time is it? When . . . is it?&quot; I ask.
&quot;We were downtown. Why? Did you hit your head or something?&quot;
&quot;Worse,&quot; I mutter to myself. She twists her head when she can&apos;t make out the words. I try to lift myself though she obstructs me, sincerely wanting something far more than I can give her.
She idles me. &quot;What are you in such a rush for? What was that about?&quot;
&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter,&quot; I say. 
I try to lift myself again, politely, to goad her off, because I don&apos;t have time to enjoy the smoothness of her skin, or the contours of her body beneath that dress. Fear makes that desire inconceivable.
&quot;Stop and just tell me,&quot; she says, as I squirm from under her. &quot;Just open up to me!&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t have time for that, Khiras,&quot; I say, and realizing how jarring and harsh those words were, I add: &quot;I&apos;m sorry.&quot;
&quot;Khiras? What do you mean -- is this a joke?&quot;
I throw my Academy cloak on. She still lays there on the floor, half-naked with one strap of the dress bent off her shoulder, as if I&apos;ve discarded her.
&quot;You just don&apos;t want me,&quot; she says.
&quot;Never,&quot; I say. &quot;Please &mdash; there&apos;s something urgent that I have to take care of,&quot; I say. 
I know I&apos;ll be waiting for twenty minutes at the gondola for the next car anyway. But I just can&apos;t muster the time to tell her. 
&quot;Believe me,&quot; I offer, but she just sits there in the darkness, defeated.  I&apos;ve failed her again. Regardless of another chance, it doesn&apos;t matter. Because in every timeline&mdash;no matter how much those illusions of past debt drive her&mdash;she will always deserve so much more than I can give her."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":41,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":1,"ChapterFull":20,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":41,"Index":64,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"Written","Keywords":"","UUID":"61","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Titus makes the last gondola car.

The fire in my lungs burn as they plead for air, but it&apos;s nothing compared to the ash and soot of Blackwater&apos;s downfall. And if this really is the past &mdash; if even the slightest chance stands to forestall the horrors of that forthcoming future &mdash; then that means a different act of arson will forever brand this timeline.
I checked the clock on my desk before I left. The sickening fear in my stomach far outweighed the discomfort of Sylvia following me out into the hall half-naked. The top of the hour is moments away, and I&apos;ve counted every second since, until the metronome of my heart was outpaced by heaving breaths.
Innocent onlookers watch as I tear gravel beneath my feet. They gather their possessions to return home, unaware that no new chapter will await them unless I act. I bump a low-class cadet trying to sneak an unfinished crate of liquor out the doors, and it spills everywhere, shattering on the ground. His curses dissolve with distance, especially after he sees my Dragon Class cloak.
I can hear the shrill whistle scrape the air in two blows as I turn the corner. Poisonous fatigue embitters my throat, and just as the gondola lurches to motion, the doors sliding shut along guided rails, I barely slip in, my foot caught in the door.
I cry out in panic.
&quot;Gods be damned, son,&quot; the operator says. He forces the doors back open with his ragged hands. &quot;You can&apos;t wait thirty minutes for the next one?&quot;
I scramble to my feet, unable to feel the pain in my ankle as I hobble to the front railing. The cadets and their families laugh: <em>crazy bastard,</em> they mutter. I refuse their eyes as I approach the railing, dripping with sweat that chills my entire body.
I&apos;ll pass out if the anxiety races my heart any faster. Cadets turn to the gym to ease their anticipation over what lies after graduation, and running has scratched that itch for me for a long time, but when it stops, sometimes everything feels so much worse.
<em>I made it,</em> I tell myself. <em>This is as fast as I can possibly get down there. I</em>&apos;<em>ve done everything right. I can</em>&apos;<em>t get there any faster. </em>I convince myself that assurance will be enough. I breathe deeply. The urge to vomit crosses, but I hold it back. My eyes raise, hands trembling on the metal rail, and I take in the panorama of Blackwater as an elixir. 
The distant spark of city lights bring me back. Everything will be okay. In their twinkling, I can still feel the pulse of this city, knowing there is still a soul.
I can taste the return of my last forgotten meal behind my tongue, but I&apos;ll keep it down. I try to focus on that brilliant, naive image my former self held to. I try to convince myself I deserve it, that future, watching Ellie grow, living close to Romin and Sylvia and Valentina, seeing them in passing and every weekend after release from our mission.
A hesitant voice raises from behind me; a ghost from a past life. &quot;Gods, Titus. Academy is over, darling, there&apos;s no need to rush anymore.&quot;
I find myself afraid to turn around and meet her face, as if I&apos;ll see her in the last form I witnessed her. I&apos;ve seen her gray matter splattered everywhere; the hard parts of her crack; the hot blood that circles in her veins still warm and fresh on my face. 
And I might lose my composure if I witness every sense of her at the same time.
I smile, though I refuse to turn around. My voice scares me when it wavers. &quot;It&apos;s just who I am, I guess,&quot; I tell her, with a dry laugh.
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; She asks. She places her hand on my back, and I shiver soaked in sweat.
&quot;Yeah, I&apos;m totally fine. Just exhausted &mdash; didn&apos;t want to miss the last car of the night.&quot;
She approaches me on the right side of the railing, trying to catch a glimpse of my face, but I&apos;m not ready to look at her yet. Her long, pearl fingernails dance on the railing. Her hat shadows the light that fades on  sweeping landscapes beneath, forever masking her true identity.
&quot;Why won&apos;t you look at me, Tie?&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m sweaty and gross, standing next to a celebrity,&quot; I say. &quot;What brings you up here? I thought you were going home.&quot;
&quot;I didn&apos;t,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;I just had to visit. You know . . . you, Romin, and I never used these lofts as much as we could have, but that doesn&apos;t mean we didn&apos;t build memories here.&quot;
I humor her. &quot;Most of my memories on this car are drunk, hungry, or both &mdash; waiting until we got at the bottom so we could all end up at that <em>Last Car</em> diner together.&quot;
She dips her hat. &quot;Oh, certainly. Isla&apos;s apartment block was almost my second home.  I felt like I knew everyone there, and not just because they watched my movies.&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s nice having friends like that,&quot; I say. &quot;But it&apos;s also nice having a home. I guess it&apos;s tough when we both don&apos;t really have a definite place to return to.&quot;
&quot;Huh?&quot; She asks. 
&quot;The cellar,&quot; I say. My sputtering mind doesn&apos;t catch those last words before I realize I&apos;ve slipped up on details I haven&apos;t been privileged to yet.
&quot;What do you mean, pray tell? Gods above, did Romin . . .&quot;
&quot;I just mean . . . that every home feels more and more temporary as we get closer to service beyond the walls,&quot; I offer.
&quot;Oh, sure, but &apos;the cellar?&apos; What did you mean by that?&quot; She asks. We&apos;re almost at the bottom, and I&apos;m already thinking about how I can evade this conversation. All I can do is plead ignorance.
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
&quot;What do you mean, &apos;what do I mean?&apos;&quot; She says.
&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m just trying to say I understand.&quot;
&quot;But how can you possibly understand what I haven&apos;t told you, Titus? Can you read minds? Or did Romin slip up, that bastard?&quot;
I fumble for an explanation. I&apos;ve spoken myself to a corner, and as I stutter my words, I reach for one last thing to tell her. If I&apos;ve blown this cover, maybe I can make it useful.
&quot;I know. The cellar. Your hat. Just promise me, Valentina, please, that you won&apos;t get on that lift. It&apos;s going to kill everyone.&quot;
Now she&apos;s overloaded. And in that confusion, before she can call for me like Sylvia, I hop the railing as we approach the station, when the ground is directly beneath us.
And I&apos;m running again. The burning venom in my throat returns as the air gets colder and my breaths grow shallower, but it proves I&apos;m still alive. Just like Sylvia, she calls after me, pushing passengers aside to try to weasel out of the doors. It&apos;s not long before I escape her sight. 
But I run into another problem.
It&apos;s when I turn the first corner that we collide, and the two cloaked figures standing beside her draw their weapons. It&apos;s the woman I met only hours before &mdash; the last soul sprawled beside me in that distant future, muttering her brother&apos;s name as her last words."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Lyra","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Two","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Twenty-One","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":2,"ChapterFull":21,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":65,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"62","Synopsis":"Titus makes an abrasive, tentative ally.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.21","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

&quot;How do you know that? Do you think this is some kind of joke?&quot; She says.
&quot;No, of course not . . . But I have to go,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;No. You&apos;re not going anywhere.&quot; Her two bodyguards restrain my wrists, undoubtedly brothers of the First Red. &quot;Drag him in the alley,&quot; Lyra commands.
&quot;Please, you don&apos;t understand!&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t think <em>you</em> understand,&quot; she says. &quot;There&apos;s a reason we keep everything airtight. Now tell me: who told you?&quot;
I strain my memory over anything useful: this is exactly why I went into Intelligence in the Academy. And I figure the only way I can get myself out is by digging deeper. 
&quot;Are you stupid, Lyra?&quot;
The question surprises her.
&quot;What in Gods&apos; name did you just say?&quot;
When her guards tension their fingers into my wrist, I feel a familiar amethyst energy sting inside my nerves.
&quot;I said you&apos;re stupid and brash! Just because you&apos;re the daughter of Ullrich doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re special. Dragging First Red operatives, on assignment, right off the street?&quot;
&quot;What&apos;s your name, then?&quot; She asks. &quot;Why have I never seen you?&quot;
&quot;You should know better than anyone we try to distance ourselves from each other,&quot; I wager. &quot;I was sent here on detail to the Twelfth District.&quot;
She still doesn&apos;t fully believe me. She turns to her First Red companions ready to beat me to a pulp. &quot;Can you tell? Is he Chymaeran?&quot;
They shake their heads.
&quot;His Essence is weak, too. No way he comes from Lionshead.&quot;
I take a deep breath.
&quot;But that also means he probably doesn&apos;t come from us.&quot;
The right one punches me in the stomach, knocking the wind from my exhausted lungs.
&quot;Amazing what the power of a name is, isn&apos;t it?&quot; Lyra says.
She&apos;s right. I just need to use the right name.
&quot;You bitch,&quot; I say. &quot;Weak Essence is the perfect cover! I&apos;m on assignment to stop something huge from happening.&quot; I catch my breath between curses. &quot;Some guy named Fletcher that Raine sent me to.&quot;
The second guard twists my arm and readies himself to knee me in the stomach, but Lyra stops him first. I should know the power of estranged family more than anyone.
&quot;What was the last name you said?&quot;
&quot;Raine? The dark-skinned one?&quot; I say, baiting her.
&quot;Before that.&quot; It&apos;s dark in the alley, but I can sense the change in her body language. Now that I found a seam, I pull it with all I have.
&quot;Fletcher.&quot; <em>But where would I have met him?</em> &quot;Raine sent for me to meet him here in the city.&quot;
&quot;In the city?&quot; She scoffs before mumbling to herself. &quot;A decade alongside them, and the Elders still have their secrets.&quot; But I see a relief in her, as if the question of his survival has burned within her for years.
&quot;What&apos;s your relationship to him?&quot; I ask, anxious by the passage of time, every second bringing me closer to that phone call from my father.
&quot;My brother,&quot; she says.
I&apos;m in control now. 
&quot;Well, I need your help . . . Lyra,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Leave your two friends behind. Your brother wants me to stop something terrible before it sets all of Blackwater ablaze. It will spark riots far worse than the one two decades ago.&quot;
&quot;What did Fletcher tell you?&quot;
&quot;There&apos;s no time for that. I&apos;ll show you, instead,&quot; I tell her."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":43,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":2,"ChapterFull":21,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":43,"Index":67,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"64","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.21.43","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"LOKN","Body":"
I caught a glimpse of my father across the street -- the single light on, stacks and stacks of papers, and the reflection of his reading glasses through the window, but his focus wasn&apos;t on the storehouse.
Lyra was livid. &quot;The Amulet, Titus? Are you kidding me? Why didn&apos;t you tell me this before? They probably beat up those Carmine for the information. I could see the glow of that column of light from my house. It almost broke through the clouds.&quot;
&quot;It wasn&apos;t really my focus right then and there, Lyra. I wasn&apos;t expecting it, either,&quot; I said.
&quot;The Afterlife is going to kill us for it! They have all the records of the Academy. They know where you live. They know where those Carmine brothers were headed. They probably even know how you like your eggs for breakfast, it&apos;s written somewhere. Now where the hell did you leave it?&quot; Lyra said.
&quot;I hid it in a vent beneath the bathroom sink.&quot; The one tried-and-true spot even my mother couldn&apos;t find my things growing up.
&quot;Idiot,&quot; Lyra said, &quot;keep it on you. They&apos;ll tear down your whole house to find it. Then they&apos;ll pin it on you as an act of arson, and you&apos;ll be thrown in jail, or worse.&quot;
&quot;Gods,&quot; I said, &quot;it&apos;s only been two days. How would they know I have it?&quot;
&quot;They control all the city&apos;s documents. How else,&quot; Lyra asked. &quot;Now, let&apos;s get this over with so we can go back. Have you been here before?&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s been years since last time,&quot; I said. &quot;Everett took me in here sometimes when he had to take care of me while he was on the job. Last time I saw the place was when it was a smoldering mess, and that&apos;s tomorrow morning.&quot;
&quot;Who do you think it was?&quot; Lyra said. The streets were empty, but Lyra made sure, before sneaking around the corner with her shoulder against the storehouse walls.
&quot;The news reports said it was Merlot. The storehouse is Carmine property now. My father sold it behind my back to try to keep his shop alive. There are gonna be some Carmine kids in there lifting boxes, probably trying to move them in and make some allowance money.&quot;
&quot;And what if they see us?&quot;
&quot;Then Romin&apos;s gonna have even more to ask, especially after he finds out about the Carmine brothers I blinded,&quot; I said. &quot;It&apos;s not our deed anymore, so beyond that, then things would get legal with the city. Then the Afterlife would find out. Then we&apos;d be on the run.&quot;
The storm cellar doors were on the right side of the building facing the back. I remembered from my father&apos;s eyewitness report that he saw them exit through there.
If only our circuits weren&apos;t drained of essence,&quot; Lyra said, &quot;this damn city and all its hate for the &apos;weak-bloods.&apos; Otherwise I&apos;d get these chains off real easy.&quot;
&quot;That&apos;s why we invented garden shears,&quot; I said, &quot;ever seen these before?&quot;
&quot;More than you have,&quot; Lyra said. &quot;What kinda garden can you keep in this frostbitten hell?&quot;
The chains snipped off the lock. I looked around. The streets were still silent. My father still sifted through his papers, running numbers. In the warehouse, I heard the <em>thump</em> and drag of boxes. The kids must have already started.
&quot;Let&apos;s get this over with as fast as we can,&quot; I said, &quot;then let&apos;s get out of here before they show up.&quot;
&quot;And let those kids die? Are you kidding me? That&apos;ll start the biggest gang war in city history, if the Carmine think it&apos;s Merlot.&quot;
&quot;Okay, then what&apos;s your plan?&quot;
&quot;Scan the basement, find clues to what they&apos;re after, then . . . we&apos;ll figure it out,&quot; she said.
&quot;Figure it out? Figure it out <em>now,</em>&quot; I said, &quot;or else we&apos;ll be burning in here with them.&quot;
&quot;We just have to get them out of the storehouse,&quot; I said. We sunk into the cellar: the only access from a dimly-lit stairwell across the room, and the side-access from the storm doors. The reverberations of young voices, laughter, footsteps, and dragging boxes could be heard above.
I kept thinking about the news report. It wasn&apos;t just burnt bodies. There were stab wounds. There was more to this than just coincidentally lighting the place on fire to burn the evidence.
&quot;Gods, I should have known,&quot; I said, just as Lyra was sifting through the shelves, &quot;the Carmine kids don&apos;t just die on accident, they&apos;re deliberately attacked!&quot;
&quot;What do you mean, Titus?&quot; she asked.
&quot;It means they were killed before they even got down here,&quot; I said.
&quot;Shit. Shit, that changes things,&quot; Lyra said.
We&apos;d have to wait until they arrived. We&apos;d have to save the children first. Or else we&apos;d have to be really quick, scan through the shelves. But everything was so empty in the basement: boxes, papers scattered across the floor, spiderwebs, and trashed piled in the corners, and books on the shelves.
<em>This is an important story, Titus, one I hope you will never forget. Even if the city has long forgotten us,</em> Everett said. I could feel the inkling of a distant memory. Something was familiar about this place: the cross-lattice of the beam architecture, the books on the walls, and it felt as if a memory I had tried to suppress.
My fingers fumbled for something to check. I couldn&apos;t stop thinking of the children above, dragging boxes, probably rambling about what teachers they hated in pre-Academy or complaining about their parents, completely unaware of the gruesomeness that would follow in moments. In the anxiety, I felt myself reach for a crimson tome with a worn spine. I could remember -- or imagine -- Everett turning the pages, reading them to me as a child, and as I removed it from the shelf, I felt the tension of a string release something from behind the wall, followed by a high-pitched squeak behind me.
The stone floor was creased in a lattice pattern, almost like a flower: petals surrounding a central column of cement. I felt the rumble of the ground beneath my feet as the pedals descended, exposing a circular stairwell.
Lyra fell backwards down the stairs, barely catching her scream, the fumbling and spilling of all the trinkets in her backpack across the stairs until she finally came to a rest at the bottom.
&quot;Gods, Titus! At least warn me before you pull the damn--&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; I said, &quot;I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t know it was there. I feel like I&apos;ve been here before. That book felt familiar. I think Everett once read it to me when I was . . .&quot;
I didn&apos;t hear a reply.
&quot;Lyra?&quot;
No answer.
I rushed down the stairs to find her there, holding her head, glancing into the next room as if entranced by a single light that hung from the ceiling, setting a lone table aglow, scattered with papers. I looked over her shoulder. Essenced lamps ignited automatically, in an instant: an item long outlawed by the city, an ancient item I had only heard of, and I wondered how long this place had remained untouched for.
It wasn&apos;t until I stepped past her that I saw what froze her.
&quot;What the . . . fuck . . .&quot; Lyra said, pointing to the large glass chamber in the corner, marked with the words FILL LINE, dried crimson caked on the sides of what I could only assume was once filled with blood.
This place felt familiar. The feelings it brought were almost . . . painful. I could hear Everett&apos;s voice still haunting this room with its frighteningly calm intonation:
<em>It</em>&apos;<em>s alright, Titus, I</em>&apos;<em>m not going to hurt you. Stop resisting. </em>There was the chair in the corner -- desperate fingernail scratches at the end of the arms carved into the polished oak.
Did you know that the Human body holds one-point-five gallons of blood, Titus?
And the desperate, black scratches swiping away from the feet of the chair on the stone floor.
And a child&apos;s can hold three-quarters. But we&apos;ll need more than that. And we&apos;re almost there.
The wrist restraints were lined with sheepskin for comfort. I remembered my seminary boots had black, rubber soles like dress shoes, the cheapest ones Clint could buy. The first few times, I could remember kicking the floor . . .
This isn&apos;t about you, or me, Titus. This is about the future of the Humans. This is about protecting us from those bastards up there, and from those Chymaeran psychopaths beyond the walls, this is about our last reach in creating ... something, something that can save us . . .
I could see his face, decaying with age, the amber in the whites of his eyes matched in his pallid flesh like a walking corpse, the faint glow of amethyst in the veins of his skin, and the incredible arthritic pain he winced at, kept alive by a single mission and a stronger pain that never went away.
. . . Just like last time, son, you won&apos;t remember any of this. I&apos;ll carry you home. I&apos;ll tell Clint and Moira that you fell asleep on my couch, they won&apos;t expect it. They wouldn&apos;t understand . . .
I could see the ghastly tension in his eyes from a trauma still fresh in his mind, piercing through me harder each day as his insanity overtook him.
. . . They would never understand what happened to her, what happened to you . . .
I saw Lyra inspecting a metal tray with needles. A plastic tube ran all the way from the chair into the vat, and I was amazed at how high the dried blood had reached in the chamber.
And you&apos;ll forget the next time, too. And the time after that . . .
I saw all the papers scattered across the table, illuminated by a single light. We could no longer hear the children upstairs. Our focus was blindsided, and just as I was too consumed by the voice of my grandfather in the imagery, Lyra was too surprised by a letter on the table, addressed with her name on it. The papers were marked with furious scribbles, held to the table by a jar of ashes, and I could tell by the difference in script how quickly Everett had lost his mind. The scratchings read with frightening imagery: words of THE ULTIMATE VASSAL, of PROJECT PURGATORY, along with two crests: a crimson one I recognized as the crest of the Humans&apos; Goddess, and the other amethyst, one I could only assume was the Chymaerans&apos;.
Across another page ran intensively detailed family trees: circled on the page was a second box produced from CLINT and MOIRA alongside me, not yet filled out.
Using the blood of the Chosen, Titus! She&apos;ll be of your blood, of our blood. She&apos;ll unite us. She&apos;ll purge the cancer of the Chymaerans. She&apos;s the one that will bring us back to the golden age, don&apos;t you understand?
I found the amethyst crest again on the jar of ashes, holding to the table a page detailed PURGATORY PLAN, but that was all I could make out from the illegible scribbles of a mentally-decaying man. Everett remarked his plans to host the blood of Chymaeran royalty within him though it would literally dissolve his brain to mush in a matter of years: the plan to combine the essence of both Gods and both Chosen in an unholy concoction.
Vera&apos;s finger tore the vellum of the envelope, pulling a letter from within that still held legible scribbles, dated a near decade ago, crumpled in wet splotches of what I could only assume was either snowfall or tears.
As soon as I saw a familiar name on the last legible page, I heard Lyra&apos;s voice speak the first words of the three-page letter.
Dearest Lyra. I don&apos;t expect you to forgive me, but I only pray to the Gods one day you&apos;ll understand the gravity of what I&apos;ve done . . .

I kneel for a glance over Lyra&apos;s shoulder. She barely has to duck her head. The short archway spills out to a downward slope, dipping several feet before it offers enough clearance to stand fully upright. 
I can tell the room runs deep. And I doubt it&apos;s vacant like the space above: when my try my voice it doesn&apos;t echo, catching on whatever shape of shelves and tables in the pitch darkness.
&quot;Move,&quot; I demand of her. Tight spaces remind me too much of my early childhood. 
Lyra snaps her fingers. The wall lamps light with a crackle, burning ages-old Essence with a sinister red glow. 
She chuckles. &quot;How do you think he got all this furniture down here?&quot; Lyra asks. &quot;Gods. Poor bastard probably took it all apart and rebuilt it at the bottom. You know, if it were me, I&apos;d just buy everything &apos;C&apos;-shaped and jam it down that stairwell.&quot;
&quot;Funny,&quot; I say. Her routine fades as I retreat further into the darkness, to the spaces where the lanterns don&apos;t catch. I squint&mdash;maybe it&apos;s just my eyes begging to be relieved of the color red, but a sliver of light looks yellow, as if a small tributary of lighttime glistens through.
My hands feel for walls when my unadjusted eyes can&apos;t accommodate the landscape. Maybe this warehouse was built atop a cavern, the way fine rocks clatter, scatter, and scrape when my boots drag. And as I approach the distant wall, raising my silhouetted fingers to find the light distinguishing them from pitch black, realizing its a cave entrance sealed by large rocks, I feel something rigid and dry crack beneath me like dry leaves.
The jarring crunch is enough to give me a start, like stomping on branches of a petrified tree: offering only the faintest give before they splinter. I call Lyra&apos;s name and she rushes over, muttering something about my weakness before bathing the space with Essenced light.
I can feel the jagged edges. I smell the faintest odor of decay through my stuffed nose. And when I press, and the hard cartilage springs on the remaining ribs, it&apos;s then that I realize what lies before me.
&quot;By the Gods above,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;They&apos;re dead.&quot;
I remember Everett&apos;s kindness and charity. All the hours we spent together, either playing games in the main room of his warehouse, or reading together his home. When I&apos;d fall asleep so easily when he read to me, and I&apos;d wake up at home in my bed. &quot;He can&apos;t be a murderer. This has to be someone else.&quot;
&quot;Like who?&quot; Lyra asks. I&apos;m surprised how little everything fazes her.
&quot;He wouldn&apos;t do such a thing. He was a gentle man.&quot; I try to distinguish any features I can from the body before me. It looks like the corpse has been here for ages: stripped of all its clothing. The left hand is missing its ring finger. And at the base of the skull, two silver-and-sapphire earrings that appear purple under the light.
This person must have had long hair: hiding their ears when the perpetrator removed their clothes. The jewelry almost reminds me of an anecdote of my past, feeling familiar but impossible, so I keep searching.
Between the cracks of the floor, Lyra digs for something, trying to pinch between such a narrow space. She remarks the fiber binding the beads of whatever it was has dissolved: the easeful, cheap workings of a child&apos;s craft, leaving nothing but ceramic beads embellished with the letters I, A, R, M.
They look like some easy craft the orphanage would provide to the children every weekend. I remember a box of those letters mixed in with the kit of colored beads and twine, because I spent so many hours volunteering with Sylvia when we started at the Academy.
&quot;RAIM? MAIR? ARMI?&quot; Lyra tries, doing us no service.
&quot;There&apos;s a missing letter, I&apos;m sure of it,&quot; I say. The jagged cave floor makes sweeping this grand space a waste of time, so I know it&apos;s still here. But I remember something before my time as a volunteer. The details get hazy with early youth. All I remember is the birthday, her smile, and then it comes to me, just as Lyra lifts the missing bead.
&quot;You&apos;re right. Letter &apos;O&apos;,&quot; she says.
&quot;MOIRA,&quot; I exclaim, and it baffles me. &quot;My mother! But she ran away in panic the last night I saw her,&quot; I tell her. So much doesn&apos;t make sense. Everett was in a late state of decay by then, mostly bedridden. We never found her. Her disappearance is a mystery that&apos;s haunted me ever since, so for her to end up here . . .
The memory is clearer now. The smile of when I gave her the necklace. I thought she lost it&mdash;that night so long ago when she said she was mugged and beaten, forced to relinquish all her jewelry. She said they beat her within an inch of her life. She said the muggers bashed her head against the ground when she refused, and for two weeks her memory was weak, never leaving the master bedroom.
I&apos;m almost certain this bracelet and those earrings were among the stolen items.
&quot;Hold on a minute. What is this Everett&apos;s relation to you, then?&quot; She asks, and I realize in the passion of the moment I let another thing slide.
&quot;Nothing,&quot; I convince her. &quot;But this is my mother. She disappeared ages ago.&quot;
Lyra drops it. 
&quot;I have something else I found,&quot; she says, &quot;so long as it doesn&apos;t twist your stomach.&quot;
I rise to my feet. Those feelings of grief and loss are so far behind me that I&apos;m surprised when I feel nothing.
&quot;I&apos;m sorry about your mother,&quot; she offers. &quot;I didn&apos;t even know mine. I was far too young when it happened, so if it&apos;s any consolation&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Thanks,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;I&apos;d let you mope here a while longer, but you told me there&apos;s little time.&quot;
<em>Mope? </em>I ask myself, wondering how she could be so ill-adjusted in human relations: pitying me one second and chastising me the other, but I don&apos;t have time to let it bother me. I&apos;ll leave her as soon as we&apos;re done here anyway.
&quot;What&apos;s that face for? Come look at this, Titus,&quot; she says, grasping my forearm, ushering me through a brief stretch of darkness before we weave between half-empty metal shelves.
There&apos;s an open space partitioned by the shelves across from the stairwell. The two tables stand at awkward angles, wherever the four equal legs would dance the least on the uneven surface, shimmed with flat rocks jammed between cracks. A rucksack carpet lines the floor with splotches of something I can&apos;t discern in the colored light. A chair with custom arm restraints lined with sheepskin. And a cabinet much like an old-style icebox, it&apos;s doors hinged open, filled with vials of viscous liquid that dried long ago.
&quot;What do you make of this? Was he some sick torturer?&quot; Lyra asks me. I try sitting in the chair, but it&apos;s tight. Child-sized.
She opens one of the corked vials and sniffs inside, gagging. &quot;I know what this is. It&apos;s blood!&quot;
I look at the floor in front of the chair: the makeshift rucksack carpet torn in a space where the victim&apos;s feet must have thrashed unwittingly.
Just then, we hear a commotion upstairs beyond the faint laughter and dragging of boxes. A change in the rhythm of words from lighthearted jest to statements of fact, and I can tell someone else has entered.
We let the minutes pass us far too easily.
&quot;They&apos;re here,&quot; I tell Lyra.
&quot;We can&apos;t leave now! This information is far more valuable. Something big happened here,&quot; Lyra says.
&quot;Children are going to die,&quot; I tell Lyra. &quot;And then they&apos;re going to burn this place to the ground!&quot;
&quot;These documents have the crest of the First Red,&quot; she says.
&quot;That doesn&apos;t matter. Innocent Carmine kids&mdash;&quot;
&quot;A couple of lives versus something that could help our entire cause?&quot; She says.
&quot;Damn it, Lyra! This isn&apos;t up for debate,&quot; I say, and I leave her, rushing up the stairwell.
Heavy footfalls can be heard above. They&apos;re still talking to each other. That sight of five charred bodies is forever branded in my mind, the sight of hardy Romin weeping at the loss as he trembles in anger, their families distraught and infuriated at the audacity of the false Merlot.
Lyra doesn&apos;t know what this will change. I scour the dimly-lit basement for anything that might aid me. I dress in Lyra&apos;s small Carmine cloak. A surplus of rusted rifles rest in the corner: aged by the broken window above dusting constant dashings of snow on the metal. Even as a prop, I grab it anyway, and swiftly rush up the far stairwell to greet the sight of whatever awaits me.
I take a deep breath, then throw open the cellar door to confront the Royal Guard disguised as Merlot, and the five kids whose faces will melt to bone from the heat.
&quot;What&apos;s going on up here?&quot; I say. &quot;Those rats are supposed to be working. What are you highlanders bothering them for?&quot;"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":4,"AutoNameFull":45,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":2,"ChapterFull":21,"ScenePart":4,"SceneFull":45,"Index":69,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"Written","Keywords":"","UUID":"66","Synopsis":"","Summary":"They find a hidden basement Titus vaguely remembers.

&quot;We were passing through when we noticed the lights were on. We thought it was theft at first, but these kids are out long past curfew!&quot;
The kids look more confused than scared now: relieved that a Carmine adult is present.
&quot;Curfew? Gods, gentlemen, can&apos;t you see that these kids are indoors? We&apos;re paying them by the hour. The Festival of Departure is soon. Their brothers and sisters are graduating beyond the walls, and you want to take away their chance to buy something nice for them?&quot;
It&apos;s just like the night I watched my father die: the same body language in these impostors with no reason to be here, not expecting any resistance.
I eye the children. &quot;Go in the basement. Quit lollygaging and finish a room for once. You should be done by now!&quot;
They&apos;re not familiar with my face, but they don&apos;t question authority. &quot;Yes, Brother,&quot; they tell me, about to file past before one of the faux-Merlot bastards digs their nails into a child&apos;s shoulder.
&quot;We&apos;re not done here,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;ve had noise complaints from the neighbors, from the fella across the street.&quot; But Clint is so hard-of-hearing from his service, I don&apos;t believe that for a second. &quot;These kids are in trouble. And those damn Carmine shitbloods &mdash; they need to learn their place.&quot;
The air&apos;s so thick I could cut it with the knife in my holster. I jumped in to this without planning, but I can feel my anger rise when I imagine the guilt I&apos;d feel in failing them again.
Lyra approaches behind me with a bag slung behind her shoulder, speaking for me.
&quot;Well, what are you going to do, you uppity pureblood shits?&quot;
And at that, they make their true purpose for being here entirely known.
The closest one withdraws her Merlotan sickle-blade.
&quot;No, please,&quot; I beg&mdash;but before I can exchange any more pleading words, the curved edge carves through the first cadet&apos;s chest. It arcs upwards before she rips it back and the first victim collapses to the floor, dead before they hit the ground.
Two children rush through the basement door before the Merlot restrain the others. We stand with our backs to that door, while the four impostors withdraw the few tools they brought to ignite the greatest street war in this city&apos;s history.
Lyra melts the door handle with her Essence, fusing the lock: It&apos;s doubtful anything less than a fire axe could bash it.
&quot;The other kids, Lyra!&quot; I tell her.
&quot;Would you rather save two, or none of them?&quot; She asks.
The two children are held at sickle-point as hostages, necks inside the twisted arc. &quot;Leave now and live, or else we&apos;ll kill them right in front of you!&quot;
&quot;We both know you&apos;re not here to protect. You&apos;re going to kill them anyway,&quot; Lyra says. Her plume of fire blasts clean through the first impostor&apos;s head. Charred flesh and bone are all that remain, without the chance to raise their hands and ward the attack. The sickle blade clatters to the ground, and terrified, the young boy runs to us, kicking the serrated edge of the sickle before nearly stumbling to his feet.
Lyra rushes left. I duck to reach for the blade, and when I return to raise my eyes, a sharp cry is silenced by a single slice.
&quot;Talia!&quot; The child behind me cries. I imagine them as the sister I failed to protect, and it feels me with enough righteous rage to overcome the overwhelming fear.
&quot;Stay behind me. Grab my shirt,&quot; I tell her, as I test the inertia of the blade. Timed explosives eviscerate the walls of the trade building: they should have reached the end of their fuse long after the kids were all skewered. And as the three back walls collapse to smoke and incinerating blazes, the fourth front wall is all that stands.
The first one lunges to disembowel me, but I parry, and when they lose their balance, a large cross-beam crashes to the ground between us, severing a wide split a full story down to the empty basement. I distract myself in looking for the children below, praying for the Gods&apos; hands to guide them in finding the exit. I withdraw as a sickle nearly removes my head, and I jump to the other side, always facing my back to the last survivor that&apos;s crying and cowering in the last remaining corner.
Another broad slice misses me by inches. I catch their blade on the crest of mine, twisting it downwards, and I trace their blade in sparks before the serrated edge stops at the hilt.
I kick them into flaming piles of debris, only to be bodied by another attacker trying to push me into the pit. I jump, and my body is cast back across the gap, bashed into the crumbling bordering wall still spanning across the gorge.
Lyra summons plumes of flame from her hands to distract her adversary&apos;s vision as she reaches for an iron shovel in the corner. I feel a nudge behind me. The child returns the blade to my hand.
Sensing a shadow flicker in flames above me, I roll sideways. The Royal Guard jumping the gap stabs his blade into the wooden floor, expecting to carve me in half, not anticipating this span of flooring would carve off with him instead.
He screams on the way down until another scalding log follows and puts him to permanent rest. The wreckage spans all the way to the cavern, and after untwisting my stomach, I leap to the other side where Lyra fends off the remaining two. This side of the room is no longer safe. I can feel the floorboards give on this island, so without a warning, I drag the child with me to the other side.
The second Royal Guardsmen is just about to land a surprise blow on Lyra when I catch his blade with my open-faced sickle, and I jerk it backwards, flinging it out of his hand. His body follows, bashing me to the ground, my upper back and head suspended directly over the crevasse.
Like all the other sick bastards above, he&apos;d rather make me suffer than let me die an unceremonious death. With his gloves charred off from kicking him into the flaming debris, he tries to dig his thumbs into the sockets of my eyes, but quickly gives up, unable to get the leverage he needs to crush them in my skull. I feel an amethyst anguish ravage my brain instead: his brute force crushing my head as I helplessly thrash over the divide.
But I thank the Carmine they embellish their children with tombstone courage. A loud, hollow <em>thunk</em> resonates the crackling air as this intruder&apos;s eyes roll into his sockets, and he collapses forward, rolling directly off me as the last remaining child stands over me with a shovel.
&quot;For Talia,&quot; the young cadet says. He reaches to try to catch me as I slide from the edge, and reclined backwards, I realize there&apos;s nothing my arms can reach, trying to twist and grasp the edge when inertia longs to drag me to my brimstone demise.
&quot;You stupid rat,&quot; a voice exclaims, as I slide off the edge and into the ravine to join my mother. But the hood of Lyra&apos;s Carmine cloak snares on the sharp edge of a cast-iron pipe, suspending me there helplessly beneath the floor like an upright spit-roast.
I hear a short cry before the tearing of flesh and bone. A wetness saturates the cloak, dripping beneath the floorboards and across my soot-stained flesh, blinding my eyes.
I claw at my eyes, too late to see the two figures float past me before being impaled on the metal shelf two stories below: one tall, one short. 
The fourth wall finally gives. All that&apos;s left is this peninsula of splintered, charred wood one-and-a-half stories above the basement, reinforced by the thick iron pipes that once led to the washbasin, draining scalding city water on the floorboards. 
A hand reaches from above the floor. It&apos;s also the first time I hear the sound of anything beyond this warehouse, all the onlookers gathered there to just stand and watch as Lyra throws a rope.
&quot;We need to get out of here,&quot; she says. I lift myself back to the surface, my hands black and red and slit with fresh blood, riding the last wave of adrenaline that staves off all this pain. &quot;Nobody can know we were here. Or else all of this, and I mean everything that happened tonight, will be our fault!&quot;
I cough black mucus from my lungs, drawing pained and trembling breaths, most of my clothes charred off. By either an act of the Gods or selfishness, Lyra still has the bag slung over her shoulder. While I chose the last child to defend, she wasted her chance to defend my grandfather&apos;s last secrets.
She coughs as she tensions her grasp around my wrist again. We make off into the woods behind the gaping hole of refuse, just as the real Merlotan guards turn the corner.
I hear a familiar voice behind me. It&apos;s booming and bewildered.
&quot;Titus? Titus, what are you doing here?&quot; Romin cries. &quot;Stop!&quot;
But we&apos;ve already disappeared into the woods. Without a chance to shake off Lyra, our fates are bound now. There is only one place we can go, and together&mdash;just as lighttime flashes in the street lamps."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Strategic Retreat","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Three","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Twenty-Two","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":3,"ChapterFull":22,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":70,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"67","Synopsis":"Titus resists inevitability.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.22","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

&quot;You gambled with intel over innocent lives, of course I&apos;m upset! Nothing in that bag can atone for the those kids we let die.&quot;
&quot;They were marked for death. You tried. And you might have even saved two of them,&quot; Lyra insists.
We speak in hushed voices, almost to the childhood home where I pray Ellie waits for me. A column of smoke dissolves into the smog somewhere behind us. We&apos;re still covered in the aftermath, blending seamlessly into the night.
&quot;It&apos;s because you acted that we were spotted in the first place,&quot; she says. &quot;I saved your damn life! Act a little more grateful,&quot; she says.
I clench my fists and march in front of her. Some people just can&apos;t be convinced&mdash;and I don&apos;t care much for the facade I&apos;ve held up for her anymore.
&quot;Where are we going, anyways?&quot;
&quot;My home,&quot; she says.
&quot;You mean where you&apos;re staying for now. Is it First Red sanctioned?&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s my actual home,&quot; I tell her, &quot;and my sister is waiting for me.&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t understand&mdash;you live in the city?&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m not with the First Red!&quot; I tell her. &quot;Leave me, try to kill me, do whatever you want if you feel disappointed or betrayed. I don&apos;t care anymore. I just want to see my sister.  You probably won&apos;t believe me when I say we&apos;re on the same side. Because I hate those genocidal pukes in the Afterlife as much as you do.&quot;
&quot;Fletcher, then . . .&quot; She says, her voice trailing off. As I climb the porch steps, I hear her dash behind me. She grabs my coat, slamming me to the ground on my back, dragging an ashen print in the white layer of snow on the porch. &quot;You lied to me! You son of a bitch, you told me he was still alive!&quot;
She withdraws her dagger, but I don&apos;t resist her. She just sits there on top of me, ready to drive the steel through my neck or eye socket, but I can feel her hesitation as she trembles there in rage, knowing I know so much that she doesn&apos;t, and so instead she huffs and screams, throwing the blade to the side.
She grabs what remains of the lapel of my coat. My back freezes where the scorched holes of my coat let fresh skin touch snow. &quot;How did you know? How did you know their names, Titus? Just me. Just me and my father, we should be the only people that know his name!&quot;
&quot;You wouldn&apos;t believe me if I told you, urgh&mdash;&quot; her grasp is right around my neck. &quot;You&apos;d believe that lie long . . . before you believed . . . the truth!&quot;
I can feel her tremble with fury. But her curiosity ultimately wins over. She steps off me. &quot;If the mercenaries were with me right now, I&apos;d let them peel your flesh,&quot; she insists.
&quot;You have every right to be angry. But you&apos;re also short on time, and so am I. So are we going to figure out what&apos;s in this bag, and will you let me care for my sister? Or are you going to cause a scene and get us both dragged away?&quot;
She wipes the charred snow from what remains of her jacket. &quot;Fine, then,&quot; she says. She extends a hand, unwittingly, and I take it. But as soon as I&apos;m just about to raise myself to her height, she lets go. 
I stumble, my head cracking the entryway window in spiderwebs before I fall again.
&quot;Get your own damn self up,&quot; she insists, shouldering the bag, trying the handle of the door to find only I have the key.
Grasping my head, I open the door to find Ellie terrified, brandishing a kitchen knife like I taught her in case of intruders.
She drops the knife in tears.
&quot;Tie!&quot;
She embraces my waist as I bend down to hug her, smothering soot and blood over her white jacket before I realize I&apos;m still a mess. I feel emotional, too: as Lyra stomps past us to throw the bag on the kitchen island, Ellie weeps as I embrace her on my knees in the kitchen entryway.
&quot;I was so scared,&quot; she says, &quot;you were late!&quot;
&quot;I know. I&apos;m sorry,&quot; I tell her, as Lyra watches from the other side of the house, lost in a memory. &quot;I promise I&apos;ll never leave you alone, never again.&quot;
She buries her head in my shirt and I&apos;m filled with love again.
&quot;Whoa there, I need a bath,&quot; I tell her.
I laugh when she withdraws her face covered in soot, sneezing as she drags her hand against her face. I grab a towel from the kitchen and douse it with water, wiping away at her cheeks, coated in ink like a stamp after use. The ash must have acted like a coagulant, because when the water seeps into my cuts, I grasp them in sudden anguish.
I choke back curses in the presence of my sister. My hands are sliced open from jagged metal and splintered wood: other than that, I&apos;ve been fortunate to evade anything grievous.
&quot;That friend of yours. He called your name. What does he know of any of this?&quot; Lyra asks.
&quot;Nothing. His name is Romin, one of the highest Brothers in this province of Carmine.&quot; I will never forget the white anger when he saw the aftermath of the attack. It sends chills down my spine imagining him now. &quot;We&apos;ll be in a world of trouble if he thinks I did it.&quot;
&quot;Would he tell anyone?&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t think so,&quot; I say. &quot;But he&apos;s easily prone to anger.&quot;
Ellie&apos;s voice cracks with fear again.&quot;Are we endangered?&quot; she asks.
&quot;I don&apos;t think so. I mean . . . not at all,&quot; I say. &quot;No. We&apos;re not in danger.&quot;
&quot;What&apos;s the red on your hand? And what&apos;s that?&quot; she asks.
&quot;I took a fall coming here,&quot; I reason.
&quot;Why?&quot; she asks. Children ask so many questions.
&quot;I wasn&apos;t trying to,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;Then why&apos;s the black on you?&quot;
&quot;Because I tried to save someone. From a fire. It&apos;s all smoke.&quot;
&quot;But smoke is bad! It hurts your breathing, and then you won&apos;t be good at fighting. Don&apos;t be like Clint.&quot;
Not <em>Dad </em>or <em>Daddy.</em> Kids are brutal&mdash;but after so many years, even at eight, I know she&apos;s disappointed the same way I am.
&quot;I won&apos;t. I promise,&quot; I tell her.
Lyra is already sorting through her haul as I approach. &quot;Was it all worth it?&quot; I ask.
&quot;Make yourself useful and help me find out,&quot; she says. 
I sit at the table. She&apos;s already started sorting the documents. &quot;How did you know what to pick?&quot;
&quot;I didn&apos;t,&quot; she says. &quot;I picked anything that looked most-referenced or recent, on the tables, in valuable places. You didn&apos;t give me much time when you ran up there.&quot;
&quot;Tie! I&apos;m hungry,&quot; Ellie says.
&quot;Sorry, let me fix you something.&quot; I wince over my cracked hands. Creasing them breaks the seal of dried blood, and they start gushing again.
&quot;The red again,&quot; Ellie says. 
&quot;Shitt. . . .or, shoot, shoot, can you get me a towel? And the first-aid box, you know where that is, right?&quot;
&quot;You said a bad word,&quot; she says.
&quot;I know, I know, can you just get it, cutie? I&apos;ll tell you a story,&quot; I say, and in seconds, she returns with a white towel, along with the unopened first aid kit my mother Moira bought many years ago. <em>What kinda weak blood are we raising, </em>Clint once said. <em>If you</em>&apos;<em>re gonna bleed, then bleed it out like a man.</em>
I crack it open with one hand. The excruciating pain returns as my adrenaline fades further. &quot;Rip the pouch of wound cream for me?&quot;
&quot;Please,&quot; she insists.
&quot;Please. And thank you.&quot;
She tears the perforation. I feel her hug my legs together real tight as I try to steady it over my trembling hands. Lyra laughs at the table.
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; I ask.
&quot;Momma asked me to do this one time when she was leaking red too, and she cut herself,&quot; Ellie says, &quot;so I wanna do it for you.&quot;
&quot;Then you better hug real tight,&quot; I say. My adrenaline is fading. I can&apos;t imagine what pain awaits me. A pallid bead leaks from the packet, viscous and dense, hovering over my wound until I lower it there. The searing pain overtook me worse than when it happened, only hours before.
I groan, pressing my clean fingers into the cut, making sure the cream saturates every surface. The flesh parts like a bad haircut, and the simmering pain brings me to my knees. I feel Ellie embrace me harder. It surprises me to remember how strong she had gotten, how much she&apos;s grown up.
&quot;Hug, hug, hug!&quot; she exclaims. Tears leak from my eyes. But I&apos;m not crying. It&apos;s as if I&apos;m looking in bright sunlight, or on the verge of a sneeze, and I focus on the tightness of her grasp, huffing for breaths between clenching all my muscles to resist the feeling. The hard part is over.
&quot;N . . . now, g-get the gauze.&quot;
&quot;Gauss? Gloss? The lip stuff Mommy used?&quot;
&quot;No, n-no, the cloth wrap, the cloth wrap. White. There,&quot; I mutter.
Lyra laughs, turning it into a cough.
&quot;Here?&quot; she asks.
&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; I say, &quot;wrap it real tight.&quot;
I hold the end of the fresh roll between my thumb. Instead of standing in one place, she playfully spins in circles around my hand as if it were a streamer, ducking under my arm each time, grunting as she tightens it as tight as she possibly can. Despite everything, I feel a humor churn under my breath at how cute she is.
She presses her lips to the bandage. &quot;All better, Tie! Momma said that will heal it faster,&quot; she chimes, with a playful skip in her night clothes as she climbs the arm of the sofa, falling backwards into the cushions.
I certainly feel at least a little better. When I stand to fix her something to eat, I hear Lyra mutter something under her breath.
&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;No way, I said. Look.&quot;
She hands me a photograph from ages ago. Three still faces state back without a smile.
&quot;That was my family,&quot; she says. &quot;Me, my father, and my brother.&quot;
&quot;Ullrich and Fletcher?&quot;
&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;
&quot;Is your mother behind the camera?&quot;
&quot;I think so,&quot; she says. &quot;This must have been right before the attack &mdash; I was the last piece of her my father had.&quot;
&quot;Then who was it?&quot;
&quot;Wait&mdash;move your finger,&quot; she says. I flip it to the back. Scrawled there are two initials and a sentence.
YOU WILL DIE WITH THE GUILT OF WHAT YOU&apos;VE DONE. E.V.
&quot;Everett Valensend,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Your grandfather and my uncle <em>are</em> the same person! That bastard <em>did</em> change his name.&quot;
&quot;What did he feel so guilty for?&quot; I ask.
&quot;For leaving my brother and I to die,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;A long time ago, we lived in a house beyond the walls. When Ullrich was out, we were attacked by Snowdrifters. The only secure room in the house was the office, high enough above the ground to be almost two stories, with a bolted door. Your grandfather hid behind that door,&quot; she says.
&quot;Gods. It all just seems so fridging impossible,&quot; I say. &quot;That was never the Everett I knew.&quot;
&quot;The kindest face can mask the illest will,&quot; she says. &quot;At least I&apos;m sure he took that cowardice to his grave.&quot; She motions to the picture. &quot;Please . . . Can I keep that?&quot;

I thumb further through records. The only fastened pages are in an envelope labeled TESTS. I thumb quickly through the pages. They look like blood tests.
The folder is labeled PROJECT PURGATORY. &quot;Wonder what that means,&quot; I say. Several pages are stuck between with drops of dried blood. THE ULTIMATE VASSAL OF BLOOD; THE HEIRESS OF PURGATORY HERSELF.
I read the lines and lines. The further I flip, the more the words dissolve to unintelligible scribbles, just like the map he left for me. The memory of Everett&apos;s eyes will forever penetrate my soul, the last time I saw him, when I brought this map and he looked back across it, as if there was something he wished to say, something he kept silent.
And then the same repeating letter: &quot;F.&quot; I&apos;m flipping back to front now. The cursive becomes more legible. Every trial denoted with an &quot;E&quot; and an &quot;F&quot;&mdash; code for names, dates, or trials, I&apos;m unsure until I make it to the front, where they&apos;re referenced for the first time.
EVERETT.
FLETCHER.
&quot;Your brother, he was down there in that basement,&quot; I tell her.
Her eyes light up, and she lunges for the document. &quot;Where?&quot;
It slips from my hands, giving me a paper cut as I accidentally tear out the last page.
&quot;Gods, Lyra,&quot; I say, sticking my finger in my mouth as I look down at it. Among the intelligible scribbles of the last sessions, there&apos;s a third name I can barely make out.
MOIRA.
&quot;Gloss,&quot; Ellie says, as she approaches with the first aid kit. &quot;Gloss and then make me food!&quot;
&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; I say. She wraps my finger, and I scan through the cabinets for canned food. 
&quot;That last page you made me bleed on. It has Moira&apos;s name on it,&quot; I say.
&quot;How long ago was all of this?&quot; Lyra asks.
&quot;At the end of his life, scribbling away on the last fumes of his mind? Only three years ago.&quot;
&quot;So you&apos;re saying Fletcher was there, maybe five years ago,&quot; Lyra says.
&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; I tell her.
A look of relief flushes her face. My lie is true, and I see her almost crease a smile for the first time.
&quot;Hand me that can,&quot; Lyra says. She turns to Ellie. &quot;Do you want beans, beans, or beans?&quot; 
Ellie tilts her head.
&quot;She doesn&apos;t know what irony is yet,&quot; I tell her.
She opens the lid, grasping the can by its bottom. In seconds, it glows red hot.
&quot;Wow! How did you do that, Leera?&quot; Ellie asks.
&quot;I&apos;m cooler than your pathetic, liar brother, here, that&apos;s why,&quot; she says. She pulls a bowl from the cupboard, adding a spoon before pouring it in.
&quot;Thank you, thank you,&quot; she says, before retreating to the couch in the living room.
My eyes catch on a spot on the living room floor before they return to the stacks of documents. It&apos;s just a blemish of soot shen I knelt to hug Ellie, but remembering that pool of blood my father died in sets me on edge.
It was only hours after this that they came to take her away. Have I sped things up? Have I forestalled that future? Or is it seconds away, bursting through the wide glass window, swarming the building, waiting outside for us to sleep or let down our guard?
&quot;Titus. Titus,&quot; Lyra says. I snap to attention again. Ellie is staring at me. My hand is on my heart, and I&apos;m kneeling on the floor, heaving for air like I&apos;m breathing through a straw. My fingers are cold. My body is frozen. I can&apos;t move my joints, and it only panics me further.
&quot;It&apos;s happening again, Gods, please, don&apos;t take her from me,&quot; I cry.
&quot;You&apos;re fine. You&apos;re having a small panic attack,&quot; Lyra says.
I stumble towards Ellie on stiff legs that refuse to hinge. Sparks pop in my vision. I nearly collapse to the floor. My flesh is cold. They&apos;re waiting outside again to take her, to kill me or anyone who tries to resist them.
&quot;I won&apos;t let you go, I swear to you,&quot; I mumble, as Lyra tries to restrain me. I have to see whether the darkened splotches cover her flesh, if her skin is cold like my father&apos;s when his eyes stopped moving in their sockets and I almost wept over them.
She just sits there eating her beans, not a blemish or mark anywhere across her skin.
&quot;See, I told you,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Everything is fine.&quot;
I slump to my knees and take deep breaths. After a short while, the control of my hands returns. Ellie keeps eating her beans, smacking her lips, then stands up to wash out the bowl.
&quot;I&apos;ll take care of that, Ellie,&quot; I say. I&apos;d prefer her upstairs where she&apos;s safe. &quot;Go up and get ready for bed.&quot;
&quot;But I wanna stay with your new friend Leera!&quot;
&quot;Go up and take a bath,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Leera will read to you.&quot;
&quot;Okay!&quot; She exclaims, retreating up the stairs.
&quot;It must be nice,&quot; Lyra says.
&quot;Having panic attacks?&quot; I ask.
&quot;Of course not. Family. It&apos;s a nice thing to witness.&quot;
&quot;You should meet my father, then,&quot; I say.
&quot;Meet mine,&quot; she says. &quot;A high-grade purist asshole.&quot;
<em>Who says I haven</em>&apos;<em>t,</em> I think.
&quot;What you said earlier. When you said the word &apos;again.&apos; What did you mean?&quot; Lyra asks.
But before I can answer, a knock sounds on the door.
Lyra withdraws the Merlotan sickle she saved from the ambush. I lift Ellie&apos;s dull kitchen knife from the ground, cautiously stepping forward as a lone figure dances behind the cracked glass.

I crack the door to lighttime, expecting a great force to bash it in. I try my hands and legs. My fingers and joints still hinge. The sensation of icy death never chills my bones. 
The voice knows my name, and it carries it softly,
&quot;Titus,&quot; Sylvia says. 
I crack the door further to try to meet her eyes, but she hunches in either nervousness or dismay, making herself small again.
&quot;I was so worried when you left, Titus. You said nothing. And I got to thinking, about . . . us, and . . . I&apos;m sorry for what I said. And I&apos;m sorry if I&apos;m not good enough, for you, you know, but, I&mdash;&quot; 
She finally looks at my face. I haven&apos;t seen my reflection in the mirror since I last saw her, but the way her eyes widen are enough to tell me everything of how desperate and weak I&apos;ve become in such a short time.
I speak first, and it comes out as a mumble. &quot;It&apos;s fine.&quot; I should have added more, told her that it was all a misunderstanding, but my mind is so shell-shocked by the existential fear that the words don&apos;t register. My mind short-circuits. I let her in when I should have explained the last four-and-a-half hours and sent her to safety, away from the madness we stirred in such a short time.
&quot;Gods, Titus,&quot; she says: surprised, but even more concerned. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m fine,&quot; I say. I contort enough of a smile to convince her as I step back from the door. But her eyes catch on the other woman in the room.
&quot;Who&apos;s that?&quot; Sylvia asks.
&quot;I&apos;m his girlfriend, who are you?&quot; Lyra says. I&apos;m too exhausted to parry with an angry glance. I hope Sylvia knows it&apos;s a joke, but knowing her, she&apos;ll probably take it as it is.
&quot;An acquaintance,&quot; I tell her. Then Lyra cuts back on her classless mockery. 
&quot;Kidding. We&apos;re nothing. In fact, we just met, when I tried to kill him.&quot;
&quot;You what?&quot; Sylvia exclaims.
&quot;But, no, we&apos;re fine. For now, at least. We&apos;re trying to find out why his grandpa is a murderer after burning down a building,&quot; Lyra says, as if that doesn&apos;t open a thousand more questions.
&quot;You&apos;re both covered in black,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;What happened? When?&quot; She takes my hand, looking at the bandage Ellie applied moments earlier. My arms are slashed, too. I smell like death, and I lean away from her, aware of how disgusting I am.
I flinch back.
&quot;No, stop,&quot; Sylvia says, grasping my arm and pulling me back, scanning my body with her calculated medic&apos;s glare. &quot;You&apos;re burned all over. What happened to you?&quot; She asks.
&quot;He almost fell two stories to his death.&quot;
&quot;Shut up, Lyra! You&apos;re only making it worse,&quot; I say. &quot;Go back to your papers.&quot;
&quot;Fine. I&apos;ll let your girlfriend care for you,&quot; she says.
I take off my shirt and jacket. Sylvia traces her fingers against my chest where it itches.
&quot;Heat blisters. Gods, Titus, have you been picking at them?&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m alright,&quot; I tell her, though the stinging pain has followed me since we left. My flesh pleads for a roll around in the snow. But all I can think of is the fear of Sylvia snaring herself in this mess.
&quot;There&apos;s something you should know,&quot; I tell her. I step back as she traces her finger on my chest. &quot;You shouldn&apos;t be here right now.&quot;
&quot;Why can&apos;t I be? Why are you being so distant? Everything was just fine until you awoke this morning in panic. You ran from me. And now you&apos;re telling me to go away again?&quot;
&quot;I can&apos;t involve you in this mess,&quot; I tell her, &quot;you&apos;ll get hurt worse than either of us have. We almost died in that warehouse, and now the Afterlife and Carmine are out for our blood. If you don&apos;t leave right now, you&apos;ll feel the collateral damage of more fury than you can ever imagine.&quot;
She doesn&apos;t even pause for a moment to think. &quot;No. I&apos;m staying,&quot; she insists. &quot;Your fight is my fight. I can never leave you.&quot;
&quot;Are you&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Yes, Titus, I&apos;m not leaving you.&quot; The confidence is unbecoming of her. &quot;You can&apos;t change my mind.&quot;
&quot;Alright, then,&quot; I say. She stands tall, forcing me to look up to meet her eyes. &quot;Thank you for being there for me. I&apos;m sorry. It was nothing against you, there was something immediate and horrendous I had to attend to.&quot;
&quot;I trust you, Titus,&quot; she says. &quot;You scared me because I&apos;ve never seen you so afraid of anything before. You said something about &apos;things not happening again,&apos; called me Khiras, and then you were gone.&quot;
&quot;He said something about &apos;happening again&apos; to you, too?&quot; Lyra says. &quot;You said that seconds ago. What does that mean?&quot;
&quot;You wouldn&apos;t believe me if I tried to explain,&quot; I tell them. &quot;Just a figure of speech.&quot;
&quot;Whatever,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;We need to plan our next move. We need to get out of here. The First Red have tunnel systems only we know about &mdash; we&apos;ll take you, your sister, and your love interest somewhere safe where you&apos;ll never face the wrath of the Afterlife again.&quot;
&quot;You&apos;ll take <em>them</em>,&quot; I say. &quot;They might have seen your face, Lyra, but they know nothing of who you really are. I&apos;m the only one putting us all in danger. I&apos;m the only person they know. And how do we know they&apos;re not out there right now, watching us, waiting for our next move?&quot;
&quot;So what are you trying to say?&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;I&apos;m saying that it&apos;s my fault,&quot; I say, &quot;and if I present myself, it&apos;s the safest course of action for all of us.&quot;
&quot;How can an accident be your fault? What are you planning, what, to just walk out there?&quot;
&quot;I&apos;ll drive them away,&quot; I insist.
&quot;You&apos;re stupid, that&apos;s what you are,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Is this a joke?&quot;
&quot;Fine, then,&quot; I say. &quot;We&apos;ll leave in a moment. Wake Ellie upstairs and help her grab all that she needs. And Sylvia, can you help her?&quot;
She nods, rising from the couch, but I catch her by the shoulder. &quot;Are you absolutely sure?&quot; I ask. But her expression is resolute, so much that it surprises me. 
&quot;I&apos;m not that same timid girl you had to save. I can make my own choices, and I choose to stay with you,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;I know what you&apos;re thinking. But people can change, Titus.&quot;
But can they? Really? She couldn&apos;t even watch when I went on my incendiary tirade in the Afterlife. In the end I watched my friends lose their lives over the same weaknesses. Ellie doesn&apos;t seem to age a day or ever understand what I sacrifice to keep her safe, and Clint hasn&apos;t ever gotten over Moira&apos;s death. That eternal hopeless feeling of always being on edge is a plague that stagnates this entire city. The unknown of what lies beyond the wall, stories of Chymaeran skinwalkers who can kill you, steal your identity, and take over your life after wiping out your family, passes around like how embers of a distant fire light kindling.
And so I nod in agreement to agree to disagree. &quot;I know. Just making sure. It&apos;s my eternal job to worry about you,&quot; I say, with half a smile so that it doesn&apos;t sound mocking or spiteful. And I guess I don&apos;t change either, but that strength I find in sacrifice is for the best of all I touch.
&quot;Ellie, grab your things,&quot; I shout. There&apos;s a force that draws me beyond the window like flies trying to escape glass. <em>They</em>&apos;<em>ll be safe without me,</em> I think. I run a long race with no end in sight. My mind begs me to stop. But there&apos;s just enough of a stupid hope inside me that swells with the feeling of fear, reminding me of what I have to lose, and I hate that feeling so much.
I take inventory of my possessions. I still know nothing of this force that drags me back from the edge of death. If I step out there and live, then I know they&apos;re not around. Who says they think I&apos;d end up at home? And if they get me, if I succumb to a rifle blast or die from an arrow to the head, then . . . rolling the dice on this curse of eternal life, I would know the next time around, and maybe, just maybe, we could make it out.
The adrenaline of this edge casts gooseflesh across my arms. I feel warmth like a junkie after their requited hit. It&apos;s not that I want to die or be done.
Standing in the entryway, I think I hear a stirring just beyond the door. Nobody else in the house heard it. I stand silent there, waiting for my ears to ring with enough persuasive silence that the shock of fear subsides. It&apos;s just the wind chimes beyond the door, I think. 
And then a heavy thud. 
An object? 
Footfalls? 
My anxiety overrides my fear and I reach for the handle to throw the door open again, no longer listening for quiet to quell my confusion.
The cold steel knob twists in my hands. I don&apos;t hesitate or draw it slow. And when I open the door, I&apos;m greeted by a sight I haven&apos;t seen since the life I last lived.

I can tell he&apos;s been crying from the redness in his eyes. His expression surprises me enough that my first words stick to the back of my throat. 
I figured he&apos;d be furious. I thought he&apos;d burn my house to ashes, or call upon the strength of his clan to capture everyone I care for, but instead he&apos;s at a loss for words, as if he&apos;d been carefully rehearsing them since he started walking over here.
His lips part to speak, but I beat him to it. &quot;Call the Carmine off, Romin. Please. I know what you&apos;re thinking. I had no part in what happened.&quot; 
Reasoning with Romin is like moving a boulder; in most cases pushing does nothing. But he surprises me.
&quot;They&apos;re not coming,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s just me.&quot; I can tell he musters every inch of respect he has for me to restrain himself. In place of a response, he trembles in either anger or sorrow, or both, unable to muster a reply or a question, which urges me to continue. I don&apos;t know how long the rage he&apos;s repressed for me will hold.
I&apos;m smart enough not to mention the young cadets, which leads me to the decision: do I spin him a convincing lie or tell him the whole truth?The image of his honorless death still shakes me to the core, and just seeing his face digs up the most painful traumas of all the emotions I went through in that last life. I can&apos;t involve him. I can&apos;t let him die the same way, and as much as I long to embrace my childhood friend, no matter if he&apos;ll jokingly call me a faggot, to feel he&apos;s still alive in a time before hubris and rigor mortis decayed his corpse to maggots and bone&mdash;I feel the same repulsive force that separates me from Sylvia drive a gaping rift between the two of us.
I was told once that compassion means &quot;to suffer with,&quot; but all I can give him is freedom from the suffering that I&apos;ll accept for him, from the pain he&apos;ll never have to know. I shut out the voice from within that screams and pleads for me to reach out. I&apos;ve silenced it for as long as I can remember, at least as long as I&apos;ve denied the feelings that stir within me when I try to lose myself in the tenderness of Sylvia&apos;s embrace. They&apos;re only illusions of debt she&apos;s grown since I first protected her. All I do is walk the line of the same path life has decided for me, from my loveless fight for value in the orphanage to the words of the Academy that <em>we were all born a sacrifice to the Greater Good.</em> 
And so I find no trepidation in accepting this truth. I don&apos;t think too hard when I make the choice&mdash;I can carry that remorse.
&quot;Clint didn&apos;t check the basement when we sold the shop to the Carmine,&quot; I say. &quot;I still had a spare key. There&apos;s a lot of family treasure down there we couldn&apos;t afford to have disappear.&quot;
&quot;Then why did you run? Why did you look so afraid and guilty? How could you not have known something was happening? I want to believe you,&quot; Romin insists, pausing as his mind collects the next words, &quot;because you&apos;re my closest friend and brother. I wouldn&apos;t give anybody else, but you, the benefit of the doubt for the horrible things I saw . . . tonight. There were two young Brothers and Sisters that came to me from beneath the cellar. They said you saved them. You fought the Merlot when they tried to kill all our young cadets.&quot;
&quot;I did, Romin. I couldn&apos;t just stand there and do nothing.&quot;
&quot;Thank you, Titus,&quot; he says. &quot;Those Gods-damn Merlot, fridging bastards, to think they could stoop as low as murdering innocent children!&quot; Romin&apos;s anger has now taken a side.
&quot;They weren&apos;t Merlot.&quot;
&quot;And how would you know that?&quot;
&quot;I . . .&quot; can&apos;t explain to him what I know. &quot;I don&apos;t,&quot; I say instead.
&quot;I knew it. I knew there was no way it could have anything to do with you. But those Merlot suck-ups&mdash;&quot; he trembles with rage, growing twice his size with how he tensions his muscles, finally free to channel the vitriol&mdash; &quot;better prepare for what&apos;s coming their way.&quot;
I don&apos;t notice when another familiar face approaches.
&quot;Even Valentina will&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Will what?&quot; Valentina says. She looks so small compared to him, even when she climbs a step higher on the porch. Valentina keeps an arm-and-a-half reach, as if Romin were a snake coiled to attack. And if I were her, I would do the same.
Romin says, &quot;So are you always going to cover for the horrible things the Merlot has done?&quot;
&quot;I would only ever apologize for the things my people <em>have</em> done,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;Fifteen years and you&apos;re ready to throw all of that out the window for your anger.&quot; She&apos;s not afraid, but she ought to be. I begin to wonder if this conversation happened in that life before, because all I saw was the bitter aftermath. &quot;All I&apos;ve ever asked for is just for you to just listen to me!&quot;
I can&apos;t tell them what I really saw. I refuse to burden them. All I can do is watch as the conversation plays out. 
&quot;Your words mean nothing&mdash;how you speak so highly of the family that disowns you.&quot; Romin encroaches the territory of that secret she hides within her heart. &quot;Paid off by Daddy to breathe air with your bastard blood,&quot; he says; &quot;you call yourself free and strong when you&apos;re too weak to live by your own terms. Your words are just like your family: fake and hollow.&quot;
Lyra and Sylvia now approach, looking on in horror, refusing to react either. Lyra and Sylvia don&apos;t have an inkling of what Romin speaks of. But I&apos;ve been cursed with that knowledge.
Valentina trembles. Her fists ball so hard on her well-manicured nails that I think they&apos;ll draw blood. Her signature eyeshadow doesn&apos;t run with streaks of black from tears: all the anger inside must have vaporized them, leaving nothing but the poisonous pathos of every scar she can re-open. Knowing Romin better than any of us, she doesn&apos;t hesitate. 
In fact, she draws closer.
&quot;I should have known better than to think you&apos;d listen! Your head&apos;s so far up your ass living in the past, you don&apos;t even try to understand,&quot; she says, &quot;and I thought you were different than all your Carmine cultist brothers and sisters.&quot;
I can see Romin&apos;s anger escalate. Something&apos;s gotta give.
&quot;The only place you&apos;ll ever live and die is in the shadow of your brother.&quot;
&quot;You fucking insolent bitch!&quot; 
Romin brandishes the back of his hand across her face. It takes so little of his force to send her flying across the porch and into the shutters, right next to the glass where my head slammed hours earlier. They snap from the force of her whole body. Romin looks on in terror as she lies on the ground, motionless, unsure of what to do or what to say, as his humored drivel can&apos;t salvage the severity of this irreversible outburst.
I should have gotten between them. I should have said something. And as Sylvia reaches to try to lift her from the ground, Romin begins to tremble, mumbling incoherent words when he sees the limpness in her body.
I have no words for Romin, just as he has no actions, drowning in his own thoughts as his head sinks in his hands. He sits on the porch, refusing to leave, but also too afraid to help her.
&quot;What in Gods&apos; name were you thinking, Romin?&quot; Sylvia says. She takes Valentina inside. &quot;All you can ever do is just solve problems with your fists!&quot;
&quot;I know. I know . . .&quot; Romin mutters to himself between a sniffle, like a mantra, too focused as he stares at his open palms, wondering how such little force can cause such destruction.
&quot;She&apos;s breathing,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;Just shocked.&quot;
&quot;Take her inside,&quot; Lyra instructs. &quot;I&apos;ll see what I can do.&quot;
&quot;Are you medically trained? Are you in the Academy?&quot; Sylvia asks. Lyra explains something about Essence, but I don&apos;t catch the end of their conversation. 

I find myself sitting next to Romin. The lamps of lighttime flash on and I wonder how much time we have left.
&quot;Live fast and die young, talk with your fists and burn out strong,&quot; he mutters. &quot;No mother. No father. And only a single image of blood for me to live for.&quot;
It&apos;s only the memory of his last life that gives me a shred of sympathy. I don&apos;t give him the grace of a reply yet. All I want is to listen.
&quot;Sometimes it feels like I could just stand up and slit my throat, and the entire world would go on without me, without a hitch. There&apos;s something I have to convince myself of, when a I&apos;ve already lived longer than I ever thought I would,&quot; Romin says. His eyes leak, but he&apos;d never call them tears.
&quot;But why?&quot;
&quot;Because I keep trying to fill the shoes that were left for me. And all that happened was I kept getting smaller.&quot; He tensions his fists. &quot;I just get so jealous of her . . . not that she didn&apos;t work to build that image of hers. But she didn&apos;t struggle. Not like us, Titus, on the ground, raised from nothing,&quot; and he turns to face me, tears in his eyes, &quot;with no wind in our sails or a voice of love or reason to tell us what we&apos;re worth, how in the Gods&apos; name does that not bother you?&quot;
&quot;Because I&apos;m always running from it,&quot; I tell him. &quot;I run so fast that it can&apos;t catch up.&quot;
&quot;And how does that make you feel anywhere close to complete?&quot;
&quot;It doesn&apos;t,&quot; I tell him. &quot;And I don&apos;t understand either.&quot;
I see that trademark shit-eating grin crest his face&mdash;but his expression doesn&apos;t brighten enough to make me think he dismisses his own actions. Around us, the city begins another day with the early risers. Young fireteams of pre-academy cadets run in formation. Other windows flash in with fluorescent light. But still the smog covers the city, obscuring the mountains and the beautiful world somewhere far beyond.
&quot;Then I guess that makes two of us,&quot; he says.
&quot;You should feel terrible for how you hurt her, but you already know that, and I don&apos;t have to tell you twice. All I want you to know is that I understand it, that pain you feel,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Because I look at Sylvia, and with such a smog-ridden, corrupt, disgusting, lonely, agonizing world we live in, I&apos;m still trying to figure out what lets her smile.&quot;
I look out at the civilians, wondering how much time they have left, wondering how they would react if they knew the end was approaching so soon.
&quot;Here&apos;s to the answer,&quot; he says, raising an invisible glass. He won&apos;t leave: his guilt and disappointment trap him here. &quot;Go in there and check on her.&quot;
&quot;I will,&quot; I say.
&quot;And hey&mdash;&quot; he catches me before I turn for the door. &quot;An angry piece of shit like me doesn&apos;t deserve a sincere friend like you, Titus. But thank you for not giving up on me. Thank you for being honest.&quot;
I nod before turning for the door. My stomach drops with that word. <em>Honest</em>. <em>If I were honest, you would all be horrified,</em> but I don&apos;t let that thought cleanse my personal sins as they chew away at my heart.

&quot;She&apos;s fine, just a little shaken up,&quot; Sylvia insists. &quot;Maybe a concussion.&quot;
&quot;I did what I could with Essence,&quot; Lyra adds.
Valentina&apos;s awake, just dazed, absorbed by the pain in her head, trying to take in her surroundings. She lays on the couch, more concerned about the mud on her boots than her own condition, resting her heels on the carpeted floor.
She speaks up. &quot;I wasn&apos;t here for Romin. I was here for you, Titus,&quot; she says, tilting her head to try to meet my eyes, but the brim of her hat conceals them. &quot;Your panic. All the things you knew that I never told you: my secret, the cellar, and the lift. I thought it was a joke at first &mdash; I can read people well because I play them, and I know you weren&apos;t lying.&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s about time you told us,&quot; Lyra says.
&quot;Alright, then,&quot; I say. I look towards the door where Romin still sulks on the porch, trapped there, feeling to guilty to either leave or enter. &quot;Can I call him in?&quot;
Lyra and Sylvia look to Valentina. 
&quot;Go ahead. This is important,&quot; she says.
I approach the entryway, calling his name. He turns sideways to fit through the door, head bowed, afraid to meet eyes with Valentina.
&quot;No words I say can excuse myself. I&apos;m an angry piece of shit like always, and I&apos;m sorry for that,&quot; Romin says.
&quot;I instigated you,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;But still, why . . .&quot; Her words freeze. 
Silence hangs between us for a moment before discomfort urges her to speak again.
&quot;Anyways, Titus. Go on.&quot;
Romin sits on the couch next to me, across from Valentina, with Lyra and Sylvia directly behind her. Lighttime filters through the grand, marbled living room window, and I doubt any of them will believe me, so I dump the hardest truth all at once.
&quot;I lived an unthinkable future and died. I saw the end of Blackwater. A great Chymaeran flood called Endogeny eviscerated every living thing, killing all the lower peoples, draining their Essence so the Afterlife could thrive.&quot;
I gauge their expressions. Romin tries to keep a straight face. Sylvia nods. Lyra looks surprisingly convinced, and Valentina&apos;s in dazed disbelief.
&quot;Endogeny,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Made from the ashes of a Chymaeran God fused with the soul of a cursed Chymaeran Mask, forever hungry. Deterrable by the Essenced, and brutal to the weak-blooded. The First Red know much of it. In fact, we were almost certain it would be our end.&quot;
&quot;Hold on a second,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Are you telling us you came from the First Red? Of the Carmine?&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s true,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;We operate in secret. We live beyond the walls, controlling the operations of the Carmine from afar. You don&apos;t see us. But we are everywhere.&quot;
&quot;She&apos;s lying, Titus,&quot; Romin says. &quot;That&apos;s a myth! The Blackwater Carmine is the only relic that remains of that past purpose. We pick up the pieces our founders left behind. They all died&mdash;along with my mother and father!&quot;
&quot;She&apos;s telling the truth, Romin,&quot; I say, &quot;I saw them there at the summit, too late to act.&quot;
Lyra casts a flame in her hands. Romin and Valentina are dumbfounded. &quot;There&apos;s so much all of you never learned. Those upper bastards herd you like cattle, depriving you of your birthright as Humans as a means to their sickening end.&quot;
Valentina adds: &quot;But how could my family ever comply with that? We relay the will of the Afterlife, and they care for us. All of us! Why does Blackwater never starve, besides being in a frostbitten wasteland? The Merlot carries their will, and their will is good.&quot;
&quot;This girl here,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Valentina? What&apos;s your relation?&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m the daughter of the Province Twelve Merlot,&quot; she replies.
&quot;You haven&apos;t seen her movies?&quot; Romin says.
&quot;No, I haven&apos;t,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;How can you be so blind to what they&apos;re doing?&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t think my mother and father even understand their full intentions. Rich as they are, they&apos;re still public servants.&quot;
&quot;No wonder you and Beefcake don&apos;t get along,&quot; Lyra says.
&quot;Let&apos;s stay on topic,&quot; I interject. I think of the whole truth I&apos;m withholding from them every time our eyes meet. Valentina crushed to nothing. Romin a martyr. Vera dying alongside me, and Sylvia losing control of whatever energy it is that resides within her. 
Surrounded by the friends and allies I&apos;ve pleaded fate to see alive and well, I&apos;ve never felt so helplessly alone.
&quot;I believe Titus,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;He&apos;s spoken of things nobody ever could have known. He knew the fire would destroy the trade house. He tried to save those children.&quot;
&quot;How did you know?&quot; Romin asks.
&quot;The last time, all I got was a call from my father across the street,&quot; I say. &quot;I saw the wreckage. Innocent cadets murdered before the burnings. The perpetrators dressed as Merlot though they&apos;re really the Afterlife.&quot;
&quot;And what happened after that?&quot;
&quot;Chaos. Looting. Street wars that weakened the fabric of our city enough for Endogeny to destroy everything,&quot; I say.
&quot;And the Carmine are furious. They&apos;d have Valentina&apos;s head if they saw her on the way over here,&quot; Romin says.
Sylvia leans forward on the couch. &quot;So when does this all happen?&quot;
&quot;Soon. Maybe even now,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;And what happens next?&quot;
&quot;The fire. I came down as quickly as I could. Then . . . Ellie!&quot;
How could a I have forgotten about her so easily?
&quot;What about her?&quot; Lyra asks. &quot;She&apos;s safe upstairs, and we&apos;ve been down here the whole time.&quot;
&quot;Ellie!&quot; I shout. &quot;Ellie, are you ready?&quot;
No reply.
&quot;Ellie, please, say something!&quot;
Nothing.
My stomach drops. I climb the stairs. 
&quot;Ellie! Ellie, come here,&quot; My voice wavers. But still&mdash;no reply comes from her room.
The door is closed, and I see the light on beneath the crack of the door. It&apos;s freezing: even colder than the early afternoon air outside. 
I&apos;m reassured by the crack of light.
My hands reach for the doorknob.
&quot;Ellie, you have to respond to me. You scare me when you don&apos;t reply like that,&quot; I say, as I open the door. There&apos;s ice frosting the windows. The window is open. It looks as if dew freezes her sheets to the bed.
She sits there on the mattress. Her hair blows with the wind.
&quot;What were you thinking, opening the window? You&apos;re going to catch a cold.&quot;
She doesn&apos;t reply, and I don&apos;t see any of the mannerisms I know. It&apos;s as if she&apos;s hollow&mdash;like the brass statues at the Academy, filled with nothing&mdash;because her soul and self has left. The more I look at her, the more I notice something is off. The uncanny resemblance is something that only I could ever notice.
I wear a thick coat, but I still shiver. That frigidness has come from within. I&apos;m scared to speak the next words because of what might happen.
My voice flattens. &quot;Who are you?&quot;
And that&apos;s when I find out.

&quot;If that amethyst travels to his heart, he&apos;ll die,&quot; says Lyra. &quot;Steady him. On the table.&quot;
&quot;What? Why? How do you know?&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;I remember, Titus told me when we were past the walls,&quot; Romin says. &quot;The Chymaeran Curse.&quot;
&quot;But there&apos;s no Chymaerans in the city. How can that be possible?&quot; Sylvia asks.
&quot;I&apos;ve never even seen one,&quot; Valentina adds. &quot;They&apos;re almost a myth. Tales the Academy instructors tell to scare us.&quot;
&quot;Well, they&apos;re very real, and they walk among you. Far more than you can imagine,&quot; says Lyra. &quot;I&apos;ve stabilized him. He&apos;ll be alright for a while, but&mdash;&quot;
&quot;But what, Lyra?&quot; Sylvia&apos;s voice trembles.
&quot;But he has so little Essence right now, his body can&apos;t fight it. He&apos;s going to die.&quot;
&quot;Unless what?&quot; Romin asks. &quot;Unless we do what?&quot;
&quot;Unless we get him more. But he hasn&apos;t built the momentum of generations of Essence. Just as one doubles to two, to four, to eight, to sixteen, to . . . whatever comes after that, your body builds Essence every day. Just to build enough to do even the most basic acts can take a lineage a lifetime.&quot;
&quot;Then it&apos;s hopeless,&quot; Valentina says.
&quot;Don&apos;t say that,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;Please. Lyra &mdash; what did this to him?&quot;
&quot;What was in his sister&apos;s room?&quot; Romin adds.
Lyra says, &quot;Nothing. The room was empty seconds after I heard him scream. He&apos;s lucky he shielded himself with his arms from whatever that was. Wound to the chest and it would&apos;ve taken under an hour to kill him.&quot; 
&quot;So it was Chymaeran?&quot; says Romin.
&quot;Obviously,&quot; Lyra says.
&quot;So what happened to . . . his sister? Ellie?&quot; Valentina asks.
&quot;Gone. Gods . . . this will destroy him. I thought he screamed because he couldn&apos;t find her. I hardly noticed the purple bruised lines on his left hand when I picked him up,&quot; Romin says.
&quot;That venom is in him, freezing his body. He can hear, but he can&apos;t think&mdash;for now. But as soon as his muscles fire and he strains awake, the clock will start for him,&quot; says Lyra.
&quot;Then how do we stop it?&quot; asks Valentina.
&quot;I&apos;ll knock him out. If we can make him pass out, it could stop the spread&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Gods, Romin! No, absolutely not. Stop! He&apos;s on the verge of dying already, you&apos;re gonna kill him,&quot; Valentina says.
&quot;It&apos;s actually not a bad idea. Lower heart rate means slower spread,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;We put ours on ice. With full Essence, it gives the time the circuits need to fight it.&quot;
&quot;If you really think so,&quot; Valentina says.
&quot;Then we&apos;ll have to&mdash;&quot;

I cry out in anguish. My body strains as if splintered glass runs with the blood in my veins. I heard them. I couldn&apos;t think, just listen and wait, until my body decided to awaken. Staying in one place for too long is now painful: any time my muscles break that stillness, I feel an incredible soreness resist my motion like running underwater. I try to remember. All I know is I reached out to her, to grasp her hand and take her downstairs, but she &mdash; or <em>it</em> &mdash; changed from that form so quickly once it recognized I could tell the difference.
Now there is nothing to stop them from destroying us. Gods, I&apos;m so angry at the circumstance that draws Romin and Valentina and Sylvia to stay here, to face the collateral of whatever ungodly force wages war on our petty resistance. Without Ellie, there are no holds barred on taking us down.
&quot;Titus! Titus, are you even listening?&quot;
I&apos;m so absorbed in that pain that saturates my muscles that I realize I wasn&apos;t listening. 
&quot;You&apos;re going to die if we don&apos;t take you there,&quot; Valentina says. The pain lessens the more my body moves, and I realize it&apos;s only because I was still for so long. Maybe this is why Everett couldn&apos;t sleep so close to the end of his life, afraid he might die when he awoke the morning after. 
&quot;No! You and Romin are not coming,&quot; I insist. They&apos;re back on speaking terms only by my suffering. &quot;I&apos;m not losing you again, either of you. I&apos;m not involving you with this. You&apos;re innocent to the forces that want to destroy us.&quot;
&quot;When it&apos;s that artifact that burned a hole in the shop&apos;s roof, I feel more than just a bystander. I&apos;m as responsible as you are.&quot;
Lyra turns to him. &quot;What artifact?&quot;
&quot;Some fancy necklace we found in a house beyond the walls. The Carmine tried to intercept it, but we were too late.&quot;
&quot;Pure Essence? Gods &mdash;&quot; Lyra says, &quot;can any of you even begin to understand what this means? Why didn&apos;t you tell me earlier, Titus?&quot;
&quot;I had too much to handle first,&quot; I say, wincing: it takes all the will I have just to try and lift myself with my arms. Its as if my right elbow hinges on broken glass.
&quot;Despite everything, it shouldn&apos;t matter. We&apos;re a Fireteam. We stay together no matter what,&quot; Valentina says. Her stupid optimism sickens me, speaking the line as if it&apos;s all just a play or a film. She knows nothing of the true horrors, the ones that happen far beyond the camera, and the more that annoying insistence shows in her face, the more it pisses me off.
&quot;And I&apos;m not leaving either. I already told you,&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;Gods . . . You . . .&quot; <em>stupid, ignorant idiots! </em>&quot;If only you could understand.&quot; <em>What I saw. What I suffered through without tears to cry, what I can</em>&apos;<em>t tell you. </em>
<em>&quot;</em>I can&apos;t involve you in this.&quot;<em> I can</em>&apos;<em>t divulge to you the demon of that past that haunts me as I see it all happen again, and </em>&quot;I just don&apos;t want any of you to suffer,&quot; <em>the way I saw you all die last time. </em>&quot;So please, I&apos;m begging you, while you can, just&mdash;&quot;
Commotion outside. So much time I wasted, taken for granted. 
I knew this would happen.
&quot;TITUS NATHANIEL BERGUARD,&quot; a voice calls, reverberating through the neighborhood street. &quot;YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR MURDER AND  ARSON, STEP OUT NOW OR WE WILL FORCE YOU OUT!&quot;

&quot;They&apos;re everywhere! Gods, I can&apos;t even see them all,&quot; Valentina says. She peers out through the marbled glass of the entry door, trying to tell scenery from smudges of motion.
The blinds are drawn shut, but we aren&apos;t fooling anyone. The rest of us stand in the kitchen, anticipating our next move. 
The adrenaline returns. My pain becomes a lesser priority.
&quot;Step out now, or else we <em>will</em> use force,&quot; a voice calls from the street. &quot;Come out with your hands on your head and you&apos;ll come out of this alive!&quot; Valentina and Sylvia&apos;s faces light up, but dimly. It&apos;s only the rest of us that know better.
I consider my surroundings. They surely have the place surrounded: there&apos;s nowhere to run now. I peek out the window blinds, and I&apos;m surprised to see the charred face of one of the first guards to fall to the basement floor.
He must have made it out through the hatch before the roof collapsed. The bastard is dressed in all-black Royal Guard gear as if impersonating the Merlot wasn&apos;t enough.
&quot;It&apos;s my people,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;They&apos;ll listen to me if I go out there!&quot; 
&quot;They&apos;re not your people. There&apos;s no insignia on the chest,&quot; Romin says, peeking through the shades drawn against the large front window.
&quot;But it will be fine, it has to be!&quot; I can see Valentina grasping for anything at all to reassure her that we will come out of this alive. It was her adamance on staying that lead her here, with Romin and all the others. Her eyes are wide, breaths short.
&quot;Your title does nothing,&quot; Romin says: not a man for convincing or choosing his words carefully. It&apos;s only after speaking that he realizes what they connotate.
&quot;You really want to do this right now?&quot;
&quot;No, no! That&apos;s not what I mean by that. Please, listen&mdash;&quot;
&quot;No, <em>you</em> listen, because it&apos;s <em>really</em> hard to tell what you mean when you resort to hitting me to get your point across,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m not going to let you tell me what I&apos;m worth!&quot;
Her hand turns the knob of the front door. She knows it&apos;s stupid, thoughtless. But there&apos;s another fear within her that&apos;s far stronger. I&apos;ve seen that same pain the last time we went to her estate, to find her living in the cellar: the golden bed frame and pristine sheets surrounded by soot and dust. 
And it was around this time, last time, that I saw her like this.
She wears the same expression I wore when fighting for worth at the orphanage, clinging to the beatific illusion of value, suspended over a black void of apathy and learned helplessness.
But she still holds on. 
The bastard blood won&apos;t define her. Her entire life has built those beliefs on the shale of self-doubt. So no matter how much we tell her to stop, to think a moment more, she has to believe her worth ties to this. And again, she has to prove it, to herself, because each time will never be the last.
But this time, it <em>will</em> be her last.
Romin reaches to grab her wrist and pull her back, but it&apos;s too late. She throws open the front door, hands raised, calling out to them. &quot;I am Valentina, daughter of the Merlot! Stop this attack on&mdash;&quot;
They&apos;re the only words she can manage before the slug round eviscerates her. Valentina&apos;s hot blood erupts on Romin&apos;s face and all over his body, blending with the crimson Carmine cloak and staining the white on his Academy uniform.
Valentina&apos;s face is indiscernible. Her head is missing. For one so well-known and cherished by the people of Blackwater, all that remains are fragments of skull and grey matter painted across the entryway to testify to her image.
I can see the fury escalate within Romin. It sparks the same irreversible rage that ushered cadets to die with him beyond the gates.
He trembles. Sylvia weeps, gasping for air as panic overtakes her. The sickness in my stomach that carried through the anguish of that last life returns to me, and I feel as if my soul detaches from my body, and I watch myself from the corner of the room, the only act that can keep my sanity.
&quot;Remember me,&quot; he mutters. The same words seem to sit on his tongue waiting for every fated end. He nods for us to escape. He plans to leave us a distraction. My mind floods through options of how we can survive while Sylvia and Lyra desperately plead for him to stay.
I failed them again. I allowed them to die, when I knew how all of this would unfold.
&quot;Romin! Please,&quot; Sylvia pleads.
I can&apos;t continue on until I save all of them. I can&apos;t imagine a world without the people I love and cherish&mdash;without them, there would be no soul in the fight. I owe my everything. I am nothing but a waste without my actions to speak for me. And so time passes &mdash; paying no heed to the panic of Lyra and Sylvia, who scrounge for anything to save their foolish lives. It slips away, wiping any chance we had to escape when the Royal Guard first enters the door, stepping over Valentina&apos;s desecrated corpse and whatever ungodly sight Romin left on the porch.
I can feel how thin the veil of time is that separates us, as if its breadth were tangible. I pray to Gods for the deliverance to return back, and I swear on the lives of the lost that I will stop at nothing to keep them alive. If I can go back, if I can just return to that night with Sylvia again, then I have the chance to make something of this all. I&apos;ll hold so tightly to my sister that I&apos;ll never let her go. I&apos;ll let nothing distract me from keeping her safe. We&apos;ll run &mdash; I don&apos;t know where we&apos;ll run, but we&apos;ll run &mdash; as far and long as it takes.
I watch my friends die. I&apos;m coming back to them. And when I refuse to tell the Royal Guardsmen anything, I don&apos;t flinch when the trigger pull sends me back.

The same force pulls me back in a direction beyond space. I&apos;m getting used to this privilege, no matter how long it may last, but the force is weaker now. The images don&apos;t flash as quickly as they did last time. There&apos;s a resource within me that can only manage so little. I can see it this time: the reversal of the muzzle flashes that collapse Lyra and Sylvia. Entropy rewinds. The incendiary pellets return to the barrel. A dark figure re-emerges from the door, uttering words in reverse. The hot blood vacates his skin, returning back to the tender spaces inside Valentina, as she mutters her last testament in reverse.
As the reversal slows, I realize how much of a fool I was to believe this bedlam could have ever been fully fixed. I have no voice to scream as it exits my throat in reverse, as if my petty cries bellow into me rather than out.
I can&apos;t return to that time because I don&apos;t have enough Essence to make it there. And the permanence is enough to make me curse the Gods in spiteful hatred &mdash; at the eternity I realize I&apos;ll spend reliving this endless loop.

&quot;It&apos;s the Merlot,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;My people. They&apos;ll listen to me if I go out there.&quot; 
&quot;They won&apos;t,&quot; I say, as I stumble across the floor. &quot;Please, please, don&apos;t go . . .&quot; I beg, but my persuasion is no use.
&quot;I have to, Titus, just trust me. They&apos;ll listen. I&apos;m the Daughter of&mdash;&quot;
&quot;No, no,&quot; I cry, curling my body into itself as I crumple on the floor. The helplessness finally breaks the wall of pressure behind my eyelids. Tears flood from my eyes: unhelpful, petty tears; as useless as I am to saving the people I love. And then I remember how it felt every time I was ever rejected. The vitriol of that same self-hatred runs in my veins as an incurable disease, and for so long my mind has rendered it latent, just waiting like the dormant magma beneath Blackwater to erupt at the right provocation.
And here it is. The pain my childhood bared to me can&apos;t even begin to hold back the flood of pure sorrow and defeat.
It happens again. Valentina. Then Romin. Then Sylvia and Lyra who are inconsolable, pleading me to motion, begging the soulless Royal Guard to spare their lives.
But it&apos;s that image that allows me to cry, how badly I want it, how more and more the blackness of death convinces me of the value of life. 
And that&apos;s when I realize that I still can feel: because if this narrow, fleeting window of time is to leave me forever &mdash; to pass beyond the reach of my limited Essence, then it must drag it from my soul.

&quot;It&apos;s the Merlot,&quot; Valentina tells me again.
&quot;I know, I know, just please, please,&quot; I beg, but she still doesn&apos;t listen.
&quot;Remember me,&quot; Romin says, but this won&apos;t be the last time his life is taken.
I persist. Over and over. Trying anything that will produce the smallest change because I have to hold on. Every time I reach for Valentina, it&apos;s always too late before she opens the door. And every time the delicate parts of her erupt across the floor from the shotgun blast, Romin is inconsolable, so far beyond reason that he even throws aside my embrace when I try to grab him, to desperately calm him down, even just to feel his warmth.

&quot;It&apos;s the Merlot,&quot; Valentina insists again. She won&apos;t change. They never will. So stuck and set in their weakness that they can&apos;t see the full picture the way I can, the way it kills them, how Valentina and Romin&apos;s desecrated image of self-worth drags them to die in atonement for their fatal flaws.
&quot;Remember me,&quot; Romin says, again, and I begin to heed his words. These people are long gone. They were always gone. And the more the persistence of these cycles drag on and on, the more I feel myself detach from that connection to life. 
My body always refills with tears to cry. They fall back in my eyes so I can shed them all over again every time, helpless and panicked, ground further and further like a machine tool in the Academy shop far beyond its expected life: how does it not break?
I lose track of the cycles. I only know this pass by the fact that my tears now refuse to fall, and that the thread now encompasses so much of my arm. It&apos;s also the first time I consider how to escape without them.
&quot;It&apos;s the Merlot. My people.&quot;
But I&apos;ve heard this so many times, like reruns of Valentina&apos;s feature films in the theater. I check the stove. The gas still runs.
&quot;Titus, please, say something!&quot; Sylvia pleads.
&quot;She&apos;s beyond reasoning,&quot; I say, restraining the sob I nearly choke on. I turn on all the burners. Not enough to light. I wonder how much time it will take before the house incinerates.
&quot;You can&apos;t! Please, Val,&quot; Sylvia says, distracted, unable to discern the smell of gas filling the air. Lyra doesn&apos;t notice either: too absorbed in the commotion of Romin and Valentina, playing out the same drama I can no longer bring myself to watch.
Valentina flips the handle of the door. <em>I</em>&apos;<em>ll come back for you, </em>I promise, somewhere deep in my mind, pinning that thought to the only piece of humanity I might have left. <em>I</em>&apos;<em>ll get the Essence I need from far beyond the walls, and when I return I</em>&apos;<em>ll embrace you all. We</em>&apos;<em>ll laugh and cry! We</em>&apos;<em>ll all graduate together! We</em>&apos;<em>ll live beautiful lives. Our children will play together. I promise, I swear to the Gods, I promise I won</em>&apos;<em>t waste another second in that room, consumed by my addiction to darkness and sorrow. </em>
<em>I will live for you all and cherish everything!</em>
The shotgun blast erupts Valentina&apos;s brains across the wall, the same splatter I&apos;ve seen countless times before. And when Romin&apos;s anger crescendoes to his last two words, I throw open the hatch.
Fighting Sylvia&apos;s tenacious resistance is enough to shatter my soul: her cry, thrashing as I drag her towards the hatch and she pieces together my selfish plan for survival.
She curses me for giving up on them. I accept her words because she knows nothing of how many times I fought to try to save them. I have to throw her to force her down into the cellar. Falling on her back knocks the wind out of her.
It&apos;s when Romin tensions his fists that I prime the match. Lyra looks on with acceptance and understanding, but Sylvia, dazed at the bottom of the bootlegger&apos;s cellar, shrieks with indiscernible cries. &quot;Gods, Titus, you&apos;re going to kill them!&quot;
&quot;They&apos;re already dead,&quot; I say. 
I flick the match against the box like Ellie&apos;s purple crayons on a texture rubbing, quick to throw the hatch down as soon as Romin vanishes behind the door frame.
The air combusts on a pulse of thunderous air. Scalding heat burns the metal latch as I tug at the rope, ears ringing from the sudden spike in pressure, lungs burning from the dying oxygen.
Fragments of the childhood home crash all across the ground. I realize somewhere beyond this liminal space Valentina is entombed again in rubble, just the way I last left her. The suction no longer yanks at the trap door. The rope snaps. I fall to the ground on top of Sylvia, shielding my face as jars of long-preserved produce shatter across the floor.
&quot;You bloody damn . . . coward,&quot; Sylvia manages, struggling to move as I lay on top of her, so exhausted that I&apos;m unable to lift myself. Lyra says nothing: impressed by my sudden resourcefulness.
&quot;There was no other choice,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Titus made the best move possible.&quot;
&quot;He let them die!&quot; Sylvia insists, shoving me aside as my face saturates in sour pickle brine. For her, this is the first time seeing any of this.
&quot;What&apos;s done is done,&quot; Lyra says. 
Sylvia can&apos;t even look at me, but I deserve it. I&apos;ll be the conducting rod for all of her anger if it makes her feel better. She can hate me all her life. Because now, all we can do is wait: hoping the wreckage conceals the small hatch; that they give up on trying to find our bodies; that enough oxygen fills this claustrophobic, musty space to last us at least half of a day before we can escape.
I don&apos;t reach to touch her. All I can do is marinate in the mixed marmalade of shattered jars, saturating in the sorrow of my sins, considering the debts I have yet to pay to the ones I so helplessly allowed to die.
The horizon of death&apos;s return passes, and I&apos;m certain it&apos;s too late.

I count them in twos, and then threes, and then fives, and then tens, over and over and over again. One hundred and thirty seven. But it&apos;s not jars, strands of coarse hair in my jet-black beard, or the number of curses Sylvia still holds against me.
Two hundred and ninety-three lines decorate my arm. It&apos;s too dark to see. There&apos;s no light to adjust to beyond the thick steel hatch that sealed out the soot and smoke.
For hours, touch, taste, and the oddness of that sixth spatial sense tell me the full story of my surroundings. Logic tells me I made an irreversible choice. Hope tells me there&apos;s a way home where Lyra will take us. My ears hear heaving sobs from Sylvia, still hours after we were trapped down here. The sense of space says Lyra and Sylvia are spaced out evenly before me. Panic wonders if they can sense the Amulet. I feel Lyra reach out her hands, and I give it to her.
I still taste the brine of preserved pickle juice in my mouth, salty and dry, and my mouth begs for a drink of water. My lungs still irradiate with the faintness of smoke. And Gods, the Chymaeran Curse &mdash; consuming me with each passing second, like feet falling asleep re-urged to motion with a stabbing pain instead of a prickle, makes me wonder how much time I have left.

The City Guard arrived within the first hour, closing off the scene. News travels fast, but not just by the way of information &mdash; the column of smoke must have drawn observers from all around.
They searched through the wreckage for signs of life. The hatch must be concealed by a slab of concrete or a cross-beam of wood, because the inspectors passed over us, discussing the remnants of the fire.
&quot;Four bodies,&quot; a female voice said. &quot;Two look like Academy cadets, so disfigured it&apos;s impossible to tell who they were. One crushed under the rubble, must not have been able to escape the fire. Another on the porch. Two more are Merlot. This must have been another arson attempt,&quot; she concluded.
A brief pause. Then a male voice spoke up. &quot;Stop. No notes, no paperwork. This gets swept under. Orders from above.&quot;
&quot;From above?&quot;
&quot;Don&apos;t ask questions. Just let this go, Detective,&quot; the male voice said.
&quot;But the insignia. Wait, look &mdash; there&apos;s no way this was Merlot!&quot;
&quot;I said enough! Let it go. This goes under as Merlot arson.&quot;
&quot;But&mdash;&quot; she had no power or words to change his mind. The case is way above both of their heads.
&quot;Let&apos;s go. Now,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re here just to say we were here. All for show. The targets are dead.&quot;

Another hour passed. The air started running thin, and my head was light. The absence of noise and voices told us that the scene largely cleared out, besides a couple bystanders curious of the morbid sight.
&quot;Stop! Hey, what are you doing?&quot;
&quot;This was my house! Gods . . .&quot; a familiar voice said. &quot;Titus, Ellie . . . You, tell me! Where are the bodies?&quot;
&quot;This is an ongoing investigation. No information&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Like hell it is!&quot; Things were getting rough. I could hear the thud of someone falling to the floor, either punched or pushed. &quot;My son and my daughter were here! I checked the Academy, went all the way up there. Nothing.&quot; His breaths heaved through his mouth. There was nothing I could say or do.
&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; the other person said.
&quot;No you aren&apos;t,&quot; Clint said. &quot;But if you do anything, leave me here alone. There&apos;s already no bodies to bury or mourn.&quot;
Clint sobbed. The same regret I remembered from my first life overwhelmed him. He thought he was alone &mdash; he wouldn&apos;t let anyone catch him in a moment of weakness like this.
Again, a door separated us and I remained silent.
&quot;Who is that?&quot; Lyra asked. &quot;Your father?&quot;
I nodded, but she didn&apos;t see it in the darkness. She took my silence as confirmation. 
I couldn&apos;t see how either of them responded. So I decided to react. I pounded my fists on the metal trap door.
&quot;Stop it! We&apos;re better off dead. In everyone&apos;s minds, at least,&quot; Lyra said. Sylvia sat there in the corner, still too angry and overcome with emotion to react.
&quot;We&apos;ll be trapped if we do nothing,&quot; I told her. &quot;Do you want to suffocate or do you want to live?&quot; I heard him shuffle, getting closer to the ground, taking in the old footprint of the destroyed house. I noticed the moment he remembered the bootlegger&apos;s cellar. The motion surprised me, coming from a man of little action, often too depressed to drag himself to his son&apos;s graduation, or to meet his son for dinner on-time when he tries to plan for them to go out.
But I saw a whole different side of him return in that moment of sudden hope, outweighing the darkness of his desperation. His hands dragged at the rubble until they drew blood, frantically scraping until he reached the metal. All he could muster was just a sliver of the hatch to open, jamming some wreckage for a crack to aerate the lightless space, to listen again for that weak voice he thought he heard.
He listened, afraid if he spoke my name that he&apos;d jinx the fortune he prayed for, that it was all another delusion of a dilapidated old man.
But my voice called to him.
&quot;Dad,&quot; I said. I wanted to believe that he earned that title.
&quot;Son. Son, you&apos;re really there,&quot; Clint said.
&quot;Don&apos;t let us out yet. You have to wait. Wait until nobody else is here. This was no accident,&quot; I said, coughing on a mouthful of words with a dry throat.
&quot;What? What do you mean by that?&quot;
&quot;Just trust me. Please,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Trust no one. Not even the people combing the scene. Let nobody know we&apos;re under here. We have to be dead to them.&quot;
He had to believe me. It didn&apos;t matter that he understood nothing. &quot;Okay. Okay, son,&quot; he said, rising from the ashen ground.
Clint found a sheet of singed carpet to cover the hatch, leaving minute space for the outside air to cycle. And after his footsteps faded away, the minutes dragged on to hours again, and we felt the day pass us in blind oblivion.
The darktime arrived with flurries of winter. Few snowflakes siphoned through the crack: I could count on the strained fingers of my bad hand the number I saw through the faintest sliver of light.
Lyra leaned against me. We huddled for warmth: there were no blankets or straw or sacks to shield ourselves from the bitter cold. Just the sweaty warmth we saved through hours of breathing each other&apos;s air, slowly wasting away as the heat always loses to the cold.
But Sylvia shivered there in the corner, the names of our dead friends frozen to her blue lips, and the more I watched her suffer with that harrowing truth, the more I sold myself to that promise I wagered with the value of my life.

And so we shiver here now. All I can think of are all the expenses I&apos;ve incurred, indebted to the guilt of this cursed blessing, and the more I yearn to reach out and embrace her, to warm her with that irrational light that comes from nowhere, the more the voice tells me I don&apos;t deserve to relish in those acts of peace. 
That fear of death has left me for now. It&apos;s not the sin itself that fills me with bitter dread, but the parts of me that broke to get here. A river slices rock by a billion narrow cuts. And so the dimensions of my soul shear their edges on the endless cycle of living and dying.
I always believed I was born to be a sacrifice: too broken to thrive, but just strong enough to gust winds into the sails of others. And so maybe that self-fulfilling prophecy has come home. 
There&apos;s a part of me that so deeply wishes I could be proven wrong. But life and the laws of nature don&apos;t care about emotion.
So in that moment, six feet deep beneath the surface of the earth in a communal coffin, I found my rebirth in letting go. A part of me died the moment I made that deliberate decision &mdash; to let Romin and Valentina march to their deaths alone, without remorse or any tears left to cry &mdash; and I will bury that piece here when the hatch opens. 
No longer will the atrophy of grief and sorrow withhold me from my eternal duty."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":54,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":6,"ChapterFull":25,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":54,"Index":82,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"Written","Keywords":"","UUID":"79","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Clint refuses to let Titus go.

After so much time in darkness, it feels as if this body is no longer my own, that the whole world is just a dream.
The ceiling of Clint&apos;s shop is covered with a cheap tarp. It does nothing to keep the cold out. This building was once a house, like many others on the commercial block of Blackwater. Clint stokes the fire, separated from his busywork in the office, but not missing it.
Sylvia spoke her first words when we left. The only time before that she interacted with me was to close her eyes and grab the tail of my overcoat when we walked through the smoldering wreckage, still glowing with hot embers, refusing to see the bodies.
Now she sits beside the fire with Clint: their shadows cast on the shelves of timeless tools and trinkets, making them look as if they&apos;re alive.
&quot;I can keep you safe here,&quot; Clint insists. &quot;I already lost a daughter. I only got you back just to lose you again, but for what? What&apos;s out there?&quot;
&quot;More than charges for a crime we didn&apos;t commit,&quot; I say. &quot;They want us dead for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.&quot;
Clint says, &quot;You&apos;ll be in danger out there. This ain&apos;t just a Snowdrifter run, you can&apos;t just throw away your life like that!&quot;
<em>Pot meet kettle. You sure know about throwing your life away,</em> I almost say, but I don&apos;t want to argue. The image is still fresh in my mind: my father bleeding out in the same room we came together as a family.
&quot;I forbid you from leaving, Titus, do you hear me? You already lost my daughter, and I&apos;m not letting you lose yourself to your grave delusions!&quot;
It takes all my restraint not to hit him in front of Lyra and Sylvia. All the hate I&apos;ve built against him rises to the surface. It&apos;s the feel of a natural habit, like his smoking, edging me closer to the endless cycle of conflict where nobody wins and nobody listens.
In the absence of words, Clint continues. &quot;It&apos;s been a matter of days and you&apos;ve changed so much. You used to be open about things. I mean, you&apos;re still shit at asking for help, but you won&apos;t tell me at all what you&apos;re going through. You haven&apos;t even told me what happened in the house,&quot; he adds.
&quot;You aren&apos;t exactly the best at opening up either,&quot; I say. &quot;I wasn&apos;t <em>trying </em>to lose her.&quot;
&quot;I didn&apos;t say that, you bastard,&quot; Clint says. Lyra and Sylvia cringe at the last word. &quot;So don&apos;t put words in my mouth.&quot;
Regardless of how badly I want to tell him off, to raise the room a couple degrees with all the spiteful phrases I&apos;ve rehearsed after our arguments, I still hold to the image of him fighting alongside me when I tried to give myself to Endogeny. I can feel the depth of the regret he feels, and I&apos;m sure every day it feels like he digs himself deeper and deeper.
My composure is strange to him, and the awkward silence drags to the point it feels like three against one. I spent so much of my time with him in anger that I never noticed the way his wrinkles crease on frown lines, worn to sorrow like aged leather. My anger dissolves and all I feel is bad for him.
&quot;Keep your coat on. Let&apos;s go outside for a moment, Titus,&quot; he says, turning to the other two. &quot;Sorry, ladies. I need to talk to my son in private.&quot; Clint gestures out the back. From the way he tensions his fists, I can tell we&apos;re going to fight again. But this isn&apos;t like ten years ago when he had the advantage of strength. I&apos;m bigger, stronger, and faster than him, so I harden myself to take his blows."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Breaking The Habit","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Seven","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Twenty-Six","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":7,"ChapterFull":26,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":83,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"80","Synopsis":"Titus sees his father in a different light.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.26","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

&quot;Here,&quot; he says, gesturing towards a weathered bench in the backyard. &quot;Siddown.&quot;
I wipe off a faint layer of dirty, ashen snow for us to sit. He draws a cigarette from his pocket, flicking the lighter several times before the smoke blends with his clouds of breath, and after he&apos;s satisfied, he starts.
&quot;You&apos;re just as stubborn a son of a bitch as I am,&quot; Clint says. 
I open my mouth to respond, but he catches me first. 
&quot;This will work better if you just listen, son,&quot; he says, as if the feeling behind his words will evaporate if he fails to get them out. &quot;Look &mdash; I know I can&apos;t change your mind. You nearly raised yourself. And Ellie, too, I&apos;ll admit . . . so I recognize I have little power over that compass inside you.&quot;
He sits close to me. The smells of smoke and damp pine bark bring me straight back to my childhood: he started smoking again shortly after my mother died. He quit shortly after I was adopted.
&quot;I hate how much of myself I see inside you,&quot; he says. &quot;Every parent wants their child to be better than them. You graduated at the top of your class. Your combat scores are nearly unmatched. Believe me, son, I&apos;ve watched, even if it never felt like it. I&apos;m proud of you. But the more you grind yourself down, the more I see the way that you, well . . .&quot;
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.
He takes a long breath. &quot;Ever since your mother died, ever since that night, it seems like me &mdash; or the world &mdash; tore something out of you.&quot; He pauses for effect as I cross my legs. &quot;And it&apos;s like you never filled it with something real.&quot; He digs deep into a part of me I&apos;m uncomfortable with, but this time it isn&apos;t insults or allegations. &quot;I can tell because I have it, too. And I think I passed it on to you, as much as I tried to be better than my father was.&quot;
&quot;But we&apos;re different,&quot; I try to say.
&quot;You really think? I see this shop as the only relic of my past that remains the way she left it,&quot; he says, &quot;and I hold on to <em>this</em>. You hold on to work, combat training, school, and Ellie, and I understand why, but your friends? Your youth? Those are all so important. I didn&apos;t have that, I never did, because I had to grow up fast. But look at you &mdash; young and handsome like I was. You shouldn&apos;t have those limitations.&quot;
&quot;I take care of Ellie because you say you can&apos;t,&quot; I say.
&quot;But if you dig deep, you know neither of us can . . . or could, Gods . . . give her the love she deserved.&quot;
I sit with the silence that follows. I won&apos;t deny his words. I don&apos;t want to admit it out loud, but he&apos;s right: I chalked all of Ellie&apos;s frustrations up to adolescent drama without ever really listening to her.
&quot;What I&apos;m trying to say here is: I don&apos;t want you to make the same mistake I did, to carry that same weakness my <em>own </em>father left in me.&quot;
He takes a long pause, failing to find a way to summarize the scars of his past in a handful of words.
&quot;It was awful,&quot; Clint says. 
He bites his lip.
&quot;Go on,&quot; I say.
&quot;Your grandfather, Everett,&quot; Clint starts. &quot;He was a weak man. Something in his past still hurt him, and he never quite got it out.&quot; 
I lean forward, mesmerized by his words. I&apos;ve never heard him even try to talk this much about his past. 
&quot;I didn&apos;t want to tell you since he was your only grandparent, and that connection is important, with how small our family is, you know.&quot;
I nod for him to continue, looking down, afraid that if we meet eyes he&apos;ll stop talking.
&quot;Your grandmother died at a young age, much like what happened with Moira. And that&apos;s why it hurts so much this time. But I remember my early life in Blackwater, living in a house that wasn&apos;t even close to the size we had, far on the outskirts, close to the Snowdrifter holes. He&apos;d disappear for days, sometimes. And when I came home from Seminary, he&apos;d just be lying there on the couch, passed out.&quot;
&quot;Asleep?&quot; I asked.
&quot;No. Black-out drunk. And I spent so much of my life just sitting there in that empty house, just staring.&quot;
&quot;At what?&quot;
&quot;At his breath. His chest, up and down, up and down, just watching.&quot;
&quot;To make sure he was alive,&quot; I guess.
&quot;Right, and . . . some nights I&apos;d curl up next to him: thirsty and starving. I&apos;d lift his arm and put it around me, and Gods, Titus, his body was so fridging cold,&quot; Clint says. &quot;And all I could think was how I never wanted to bring some bastard child into the world, to suffer the same way. But then Everett found you at the orphanage. He insisted we raise you, that there was something special, and then Moira saw that same light when she worked at the orphanage.&quot;
&quot;What do you mean by that? Everett found me?&quot;
&quot;He brought you to the Orphanage, but he never said from where, just that he had a &apos;debt to pay.&apos; Moira and Everett are the only reason you&apos;re here with me. But you, son &mdash; you proved me wrong that I didn&apos;t want a child. You&apos;re the reason that Ellie is here. Or was . . . &quot; He takes another draw of his cigarette, adjusting his position on the bench. &quot;Gods be damned. Just don&apos;t end up an old bastard like me, so full of hate, pain, and regret, and &mdash; Titus, why are you crying?&quot;
The tears pour out of me. All those cycles wore down the barrier he created for me. &quot;No, continue,&quot; I insist.
&quot;Well, it takes almost losing two of yous before an old stubborn pecker like me can get the words out.&quot; He laughs before it turns into a smoker&apos;s cough. &quot;I know I&apos;m not going to change your mind. I know there&apos;s a part deep inside of you that hates me for what I&apos;ve done &mdash; or rather, failed to do for you as a father. But if it&apos;s not me you talk to about these things, then I urge you to talk to someone. If there&apos;s one thing you remember, it&apos;s this: be better than I was, son.&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t hate you,&quot; I tell him.&quot;I just pity how Mom&apos;s death hurt you. I&apos;m . . . saddened by how much it still impacts how you live.&quot;
Clint rubs under his chin before closing the cigarette pack. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;And another thing. I know you haven&apos;t forgotten what . . . what I did to you, that terrible night that your mother disappeared. But I&apos;ll be damned if I don&apos;t speak on it. I want to tell you I&apos;m sorry, son, for how I hurt you. Physically, emotionally.&quot;
&quot;Thank you,&quot; I say. They&apos;re tough words for him to muster, only drawn out by how temporal this last moment of ours is. Emotion is a muscle to train, and we&apos;re both weak and emaciated in those respects: it feels as if we&apos;ve finished a tough workout. There&apos;s so much more to unpack between the two of us. But we both understand we&apos;re out of time. 
Clint stands up. He trades clouds of smoke for clouds of breath as he stretches his sore back, and I stand alongside him. I can tell how badly he doesn&apos;t want me to leave, but it&apos;s not up to him. I&apos;m doing this to save all of them. I&apos;ll have to hold myself to this purpose even if it destroys me, because if I fail, I will have nothing to live for.
He reaches out his hand as if we&apos;re making a business deal. But the feel of something smooth, cold, and slender surprises me between our palms.
&quot;If I can&apos;t convince you to stay, then I want her to protect you,&quot; Clint says. &quot;You&apos;ll need her presence more than I will.&quot;
&quot;Thanks, Dad,&quot; I tell him.
I take the necklace pendant from my mother in my fingers. She never took it off: not even when she joined my father for bed. If Moira were watching, she&apos;d laugh at how dislocated we are from emotion: without her bringing us together, maybe this is the first time we&apos;ve ever tried.
So the two Berguard men shake hands, unable to conjure any further words, and just like always, unable to persuade the other to change their mind."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":56,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":7,"ChapterFull":26,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":56,"Index":85,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"Written","Keywords":"","UUID":"82","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Titus takes what he needs.

Clint&apos;s last gift is free pickings over the shop for whatever we need. It&apos;s all the things I&apos;ve found over the years, anyway. He remains outside, unable to usher himself in, weeding through a full pack of his favorite cigarettes and warming his hands over a barrel of fire, waiting for us to leave.
I gather my Snowdrifter gear minus the sled while Sylvia takes one of my mother&apos;s old jackets. My fingers fondle the smooth surface of the pendant Clint gave me. Lyra returns after gathering gear she stored away somewhere; she left while Clint and I were talking.
&quot;So your father&apos;s not coming?&quot; Lyra asks.
&quot;He wishes to stay here. It&apos;s better to leave him out of this, anyways,&quot; I say.
&quot;Gods know what the Royal Guard will do with the Amulet. We have to relay this information now. The Elders can&apos;t ignore this. We&apos;re all going to return for one last fight!&quot;
I&apos;m surprised when I find excitement on her face. But I know exactly what happens. I&apos;m cursed with the knowledge of everything. I have a power that might make me even stronger than the Gods, but in no way do I equate myself above them. I&apos;m not like Ullrich and the prideful Afterlives.
&quot;There&apos;s a major battle coming,&quot; Lyra insists, and her senses are right. Beyond the walls of the house, the infighting between the Merlot and Carmine has already begun, with or without Romin and Valentina, weakening the fabric of Blackwater for the perfect attack. &quot;Follow me back to the First Red, and you&apos;ll be entering a hard life of conflict against the forces of pure evil. But as Academy cadets on the cusp of graduation, we all know you&apos;ve steeled yourself for that life.&quot;
That path is my only means to an end. 
&quot;I&apos;ll go,&quot; I say, before I turn to Sylvia. &quot;<em>We</em> will go.&quot; 
&quot;Alright, then,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Our Chymaeran contacts planned the quickest return home possible.&quot;
&quot;It&apos;ll take at least three days. We don&apos;t even have enough provisions.&quot;
&quot;Not when you travel by train,&quot; she says.
&quot;A train?&quot; Sylvia asks. &quot;But it isn&apos;t our time yet. Why would they run trains?&quot;
&quot;This train isn&apos;t for that waste of life and effort they call service. It&apos;s for something different. It&apos;s for the service of the lower ranks, the ones they deem useless,&quot; she says.
I remember no talks of transit in my first cycle. &quot;Where would it go? What is out there?&quot; I ask.
&quot;It&apos;s a far bigger world than either of you can ever imagine. It is filled with horrors far beyond anything your narrow perception of life grants you here,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Do you ever ask yourself why so few people starve, where the endless supply of produce comes from, and where&mdash;&quot;
Her words halt in an instant, suddenly attuned to something we can&apos;t sense.
&quot;What is it?&quot; Sylvia asks.
&quot;They&apos;re here.&quot;
&quot;Who&apos;s here?&quot; I ask.
&quot;You have to promise not to be too upset. It was the perfect identity for them to keep the continuity,&quot; Lyra says. 
She turns to the heavy front doors, bolted shut with a temporary hinge Clint installed after the night they were bashed open.
&quot;Steel yourself,&quot; she tells us.
I squint my eyes to accomodate the familiar silhouettes when they enter.
I can&apos;t believe what I see. It is all so impossible: they take the form of the two childhood friends I&apos;ve loved as if I never lost them. 
I feel my heart skip for a second before I remember Lyra&apos;s words, and I know Sylvia reacts the same way.
A different Valentina and Romin stand at the door. Their mannerisms are convincing. Only I can tell they&apos;re slightly off.
&quot;These are the Chymaerans that will take us,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;They hold to the true spirit of Blackwater, long before royalty bastardized its nature.&quot;
The Romin looks on with amethyst eyes, speaking with a voice that I remember. &quot;I&apos;m sorry. The bodies of your friends are unidentifiable. With this form, it will be to Blackwater as if they never left.&quot;
Valentina&apos;s clone opens her mouth, and her voice is just as convincing. &quot;Now is our window. We need to leave,&quot; she says.
I take Sylvia&apos;s hand. She tensions her fingers in mine, standing tall for the first time since I can remember, rising to that half-inch-or-so she has over me, holding my hand gently as she looks on towards the world outside. That same feeling of love comes back to me again and I allow it to flow over me, putting off the truth that whatever actions await us are meaningless and temporal if they&apos;re to be overwritten.
But I relish in it for now: I allow it to recharge my weathered soul. I&apos;ll tell her about this curse, whether she believes me or not. Even though she&apos;ll lose her memory of it when time resets. 
Gods know how long peace will take, but I want to believe in the waning strength I have to continue, between my soul and the Chymaeran Curse that has stretched so far in little time.

For decades, the vacant shipping depot rested at the edge of the Twelfth District&apos;s outer walls:  a relic of an ancient time I passed on many Snowdrifter trips. Most don&apos;t know what the decrepit building is used for. All they&apos;ve seen is that it rotted for decades, rusted from endless snowstorms blasted at the ungalvanized metal, surprised that it still sees the arrival and departure of trains at all. Enough that it became a myth, living in the dreams and speculations of everyone who has borne witness.
When we arrived hours earlier, it was flooded with activity, swarmed with Royal Guard and Merlot preparing the train cars. The two separatist Chymaerans morphed from familiar faces to random railworkers. In their hands were a keyring of blackened bone charms from their pockets, and with a surge of amethyst energy, they drew from the bone marrow with Essence, capturing their guise and gestures with near flawless accuracy. Their speech was convincing, carrying the slang and tone of the impoverished outwallers, the same style I recognized in my father.
&quot;Us skinwalkers are mixed bloods, &apos;round half&apos;a human, half&apos;a Chyme,&quot; the blonde-haired Chymaeran said, guising as a Carmine coal miner that died in a gruesome accident four years ago. 
The second Chymaeran had a great slash across their face: dark hair and piercing blue eyes. The original victim was stabbed coming home from work and died alone on the street. Though the true body is six feet under somewhere with a missing bone, it looks as if that soul hadn&apos;t missed a day of life.
Both recalled their hosts&apos; memories of Blackwater industry, and the clothes they conjured were an extension of their bodies&apos; Essence. The materials were astounding, so close to the true textures only touch could differentiate them. The fabrics folded like true cloth, but to the touch, every part of their disguise felt like frigid iron.
&quot;Put &apos;ese on,&quot; the blonde Chymaeran said. Industry clothes, fashioned from the power of Chymaeran and Human Essence masterfully intertwined together. The scarred Chymaeran recalled their hosts&apos; memories of childhood playing on the tracks, long enough ago that trains still ran through the station. Although a large steel-barred fence deterred scavengers and vagrants, the scarred recalled a small space dug beneath the bottom, where ages ago their guise snuck through.
The land just beyond the station was decrepit and undeveloped. Containers rotted to rust from snow and ice, and so much trash and waste sullied the dirt with rancid odors. The train station at the center was the only stone monolith to defy the slagyards, although its age showed in dusty shattered glass and worn engravings on the walls.
The Chymaerans&apos; clothes dissolved to amorphous black, and in less than a blink they metastasized again as the fine robes of the Royal Guard.
The one that guised Romin instructed us to play along, with their tongue changed to high speech. They had a cleaner face and a refined look, despite the consistent, straggling scar slicing straight down their face.
The blonde Chymaeran turned to us. &quot;You&apos;re a maintenance crew, performing inspection on the coupling between coffin car 46 and 47.&quot;
No one asks that many questions if you&apos;re carrying tools somewhere. I picked up a long rusted crescent wrench from atop an iron barrel to further my disguise, and our bags only added to the persuasion. We circled the perimeter of the building for the side entrance. Several technicians sat on petrified stumps just beyond the heavy-duty side door, warming their hands over a barrel. A single Royal Guard observed them.
He turned to us. &quot;Finally, about time those bloody-damn railmen showed up,&quot; he said. 
&quot;They &apos;ad us prepping these cars for weeks, and you cunts show at the last minute,&quot; one railmen complains. &quot;Still got two carts needin&apos; a lathe, so get on it, fresh blood!&quot;
&quot;Lathe?&quot; Sylvia asks. I know what it is from my time in the machine shop, but the scarred answers her first, in a hushed whisper.
&quot;Wheel lathe, he says. Profiles the wheels before departure. Keep them round.&quot;
&quot;But I don&apos;t know how to use it,&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;I got some&apos;in you can use!&quot; One says.
&quot;An&apos;ya got a bitch workin&apos; lines?&quot; They say, when Sylvia appears from behind me. &quot;Fine, too.  Nice knockers &mdash; guess whorin&apos; these days is so bad you gotta do a man&apos;s work.&quot;
&quot;Why don&apos;t ya polish my shaft,&quot; another says.
&quot;That&apos;s enough from you. Get back to work, shitbloods,&quot; the lone Royal Guard said. They grumbled, back to their drivel about sex and drinking. &quot;And you two,&quot; he said, pointing to the guised Chymaerans, &quot;what are your plans with those shitbloods?&quot;
I spoke up. &quot;We&apos;re maintenance crew for the&mdash;&quot;
The Royal Guard struck me across the face without a moment&apos;s hesitation. He didn&apos;t even bother to meet my eyes, turning to the Chymaerans. &quot;One more word and that worker is leaving its crew in a body bag,&quot; he said. &quot;Now what are they here for?&quot;
The scarred regurgitated my lines. &quot;Maintenance on the couplings. Cycled strain between the forty-seven and forty-eight couplings are long overdue. Age and impulse loads stretch far beyond infinite yield.&quot;
&quot;Enough big words. Royal Guard shouldn&apos;t partake in that feculent tongue. Do what you have to,&quot; he said, and we passed through the door, eyes down, sure to make no contact with any of the Royal Guard. 
&quot;<em>It.</em>&quot; Gods, I&apos;d almost forgotten how much irrational hatred the upper scumbags have for our people. Lyra tensioned her fists, the same thought on her mind.
The blonde Chymaeran tugged my shirt. &quot;It&apos;s best if I do the talking here,&quot; he said, and I nodded in response.
On the platform of the stabling area, where the ready trains awaited departure, the scarred approached a group of higher-level Royal Guards. He recalled the thoughts of his precious guise. 
&quot;These shitbloods are doing maintenance on the couplings. We only have time for loaded carriages since they&apos;ll take the most force. Do you know which have pre-loaded?&quot;
One of them pointed to three cars, painted with a green dash I could only imagine meant READY FOR DEPARTURE. As they asked the Chymaerans about the logistics of the maintenance job, I listened in to the other guards discussing the details of their next move.
&quot;Prepare the carriages for fuel. Purgatory is on the way,&quot; an intercom buzzed. Few lower tradesmen remained in the belly of the depot. Colors of jade and vermilion swarmed the spaces between the tracks like a muddle of ants carrying leaves and fruit. Purgatory? As in a place? A weapon?
&quot;Prepare for departure. Loading will begin in one hour,&quot; the announcement spoke.
&quot;We need to get us in the storage cars,&quot; the blonde Chymaeran said, but my mind was wrapped in the mystery of my surroundings. So many storage cars: empty, without seats or soft flooring. It couldn&apos;t be for liquid fuel. Maybe lumber? No, that wouldn&apos;t make sense &mdash; all the trees are outside these walls. That&apos;d be like exporting water to a lake.
With an hour until departure, at a moment when the guards&apos; eyes no longer watched our hands pretending to tinker with the machinery, we dipped into the second loaded car, throwing the heavy door aside just far enough to squeeze through. Despite the climate of our lands, the carriage was hot and stuffy, but we didn&apos;t dare open the doors again to vent. We suffered through this for hours in the bootlegger hatch, and it didn&apos;t trouble us to tough it out for a little longer. 
Our Chymaerans locked the latches from the inside. Commanding shouts and screeching cars shook the floor of Carriage Forty-Eight. And as soon as the darkness concealed them, my eyes could no longer discern the shape of the Chymaerans. Just a darkness blacker than black, as if their bodies starved the space of every ribbon of light.
Our disguises dissolved faster than a fake smile without a witness, leaving us in our travel clothes. We wouldn&apos;t need our coats until rushing polar winds could breach the splintered slats, so we sat in silence for that hour, trying to discern the voices of a large crowd ushered towards the cars. What lucky bastards we were when we realized what we missed."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":58,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":8,"ChapterFull":27,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":58,"Index":88,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"Written","Keywords":"","UUID":"85","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Ride train.

&quot;I never knew there was this much sky out there,&quot; says Sylvia, captivated by the sights unfolding like pages from my grandfather&apos;s old storybooks. The light lasts just long enough to bless the world with one last flood of color, spilling all the paints across the sky before sepia swallows the world. 
In my mind&apos;s eye I remember the first Snowdrifter trips with my grandfather, when I began building my stamina for long treks. He told me to absorb the sights and serenity of life unfolding around me. <em>Listen for the static, can you hear it?</em> He would ask, and I&apos;d listen and listen, waiting for a sound to ring in my ears. I&apos;d get frustrated after a time. <em>I can</em>&apos;<em>t hear it, </em>I&apos;d say. He&apos;d laugh and keep asking over and over, every half an hour, until it became the only thought that filled my mind.
Years later, I considered it was a genius way of getting me to shut up and stop asking if <em>we were there yet.</em> But as age dragged me closer to the edge of graduation, phase after phase until I now realize the true shortness of time, I&apos;ve found what he really meant. The demands of my abruptly-shortened childhood threaten to swallow me alive. I find gray hairs in my beard. I lose weight from malnutrition. And responsibilities have become so severe that the pit in my stomach is a feature, not a sickness.
The older I get, the more I realize that static is just the absence; everything that isn&apos;t. It was the space between the trees when the snow crunched under my small feet. It was the drawn silence between question and answer before Everett would laugh and ask it again. And now it&apos;s the pause between rhythmic jolts of the chassis as the steel screeches against the rails, casting sparks beneath the floor.
I can detach my emotions the more I convince myself that this life is temporal. A breadth of time separates me from my loved ones only by a trail of Essence. I can feel the texture of every memory as if it still breathes, like a cherished friend waiting for me to return. And when I look at Lyra and Sylvia, I try harder and harder to separate myself from becoming attached to these afterimages of a failure that will soon be rewritten. These people are temporal too . . . I have to convince myself, I have to believe that.
&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; Sylvia asks.
&quot;Just some words from my father,&quot; I say. She rests her head against my shoulder. I let it happen, but I turn away. 
&quot;What did he tell you?&quot; She asks.
&quot;Words he should have said a decade ago,&quot; I say. &quot;But welcome words &mdash; it&apos;s not too late.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m glad you had that chance. You were so different,&quot; she says.
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
&quot;You&apos;re so kind and patient around your friends, but around your father, you&apos;re usually angry and short.&quot; She pauses. &quot;In <em>temper,</em> not&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Of course,&quot; I say.
&quot;But you were patient with him this time. I can&apos;t remember the last time I ever saw you like that.&quot;The last fight with him replays in my mind: the sincerity of his regret and the emptiness I found in his heart. 
&quot;It&apos;s just the finality of everything. Funny how it drags the words out of us, the ones we&apos;d never say before, huh?&quot; 
My spirit longs to open up and tell her everything, but I&apos;m so afraid that if I break apart now, I won&apos;t have the strength to sacrifice for all the ones who didn&apos;t make it: the ones I owe my life to.
&quot;You know, sometimes I just wish I wasn&apos;t so weak,&quot; she says.
&quot;No&mdash;&quot; My face scrunches when I disagree. &quot;You&apos;re not. You and I have been down a terrible, grueling path in each of our lives, yet we&apos;ve both made it this far.&quot;
&quot;Because of how needy I am. It feels like I&apos;m always behind you, tugging at your cloak for you to lead me on, ever since the orphanage. And I feel awful for always being your . . . burden,&quot; she says. That last word parts from her lips like a curse. &quot;And it makes me so sorry for that.&quot;
&quot;You are never a burden,&quot; I insist, &quot;because we depend on each other. Don&apos;t you ever think that!&quot;
&quot;I&mdash;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; she says, burying her head in my arm before I notice my moment of passion was misread. But&mdash;before I can remind her to stop apologizing for things that aren&apos;t her fault, she continues.
&quot;You&apos;d tell me that insistence I had earlier to stay by your side was courage,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;Telling you I was in it no matter what. It sounded brave when I said it.&quot;
&quot;It was brave,&quot; I say.
&quot;But really &mdash; I was so afraid of a world without you that I couldn&apos;t bear to be alone again. The voices, Titus! All the voices of my past have lost their distinction, as those playground kids or abusive adults or . . . the others . . . I wish I could forget. The further time takes me from them and their jeers of how pathetic I am, the more that voice becomes my own. And the more I hear myself, the harder it is to hear anything else.&quot;
&quot;What&apos;s strength to you, then? Brawn like Romin? Charisma like Valentina?&quot;
&quot;Resilience like you,&quot; she says. &quot;Strong enough to carry the weight of the world. Honed and one-pointed enough to let the pain pass through you. Direction. Conviction.&quot; 
And maybe that&apos;s the image that burned in her mind for the months I was asleep in the Afterlife. That&apos;s what she almost became. And maybe at the end of it she understood just like I do that the pain never passes through. It&apos;s an act of atrophy, constantly adding wax and sculpting a candle that burns from both ends. And maybe I&apos;ve become convincing enough to hide it.
&quot;And that&apos;s exactly why I find <em>myself</em> weak,&quot; I say. Because I fail to find the strength or words to tell her how I feel. Even now. I didn&apos;t lie when I told Romin I was always running from that feeling that drags behind me like my own shadow. And the image of my father&apos;s weakness shows me, again, that freedom I&apos;m so afraid of.
&quot;Sometimes it feels like you&apos;re the last light that survived from those times of innocence. You&apos;ve always protected me. I just wish I could do more,&quot; Sylvia says, as she snuggles up to my arm, completely unaware of the comfort and fullness she&apos;s brought to me&mdash;though I&apos;ve always fumbled on the words to tell her.
Maybe I can do it this time.
&quot;You do enough,&quot; I mutter.
&quot;Huh?&quot; She says. Her beautiful crimson eyes meet mine, and for a moment, my voice wavers. 
&quot;You always do enough. Because . . . you&apos;re the reason I&apos;ve made it this far, too.&quot;
&quot;Titus,&quot; she says. My name is so sweet from her lips, and then I feel it: how something so softly opens inside me, before I can recapture it; how I spent all those years pounding at the door when all I needed was patience and clemency. 
I can feel my face so magnetically drawn to hers, and I realize I&apos;ve always felt it, that feeling, and the last thought I manage is to contemplate the softness of her lips.
Then the train lurches to a halt. 
We don&apos;t. 
The wheels no longer mask the sound of shouts and screams beyond the car. It&apos;s only then that we realize what the &quot;fuel&quot; is, faster than our bodies slam against the hay bales along the front wall.
I hear the voices of cadets, no older than I am, crying out into the night. Fists pound on the walls and doors of the train like lumberjacks chopping a full forest, and moments later, from the shear force of a hundred bodies pressing against the wooden panels, the walls snap, relieving several cars of imprisoned cadets like barrels of wine struck with an axe.
&quot;Now! Run for the tree line,&quot; a weak voice calls. I can see them now: cadets of the lowest class in the Academy. 
The highest class, Dragon Class, is sent beyond the walls to fight at the highest ranks, or to defend the Afterlife from unrest. The middle, Garnet Class, often ends up guarding the outer city. I always wondered what became of the lowest cadets who weren&apos;t called to the highest honors.
Their resistance is futile. The Chymaeran Royal Guards dissolve to sickly caricatures of obsidian, their limbs sharper than the branches of the leafless trees. With so much time spent in darkness my eyes cannot afford me any color, but I can see the snow runs dark, and I know on the other side of the snow banks lie the lower cadets who were foolish enough to try to escape first.
&quot;Do we run for it? What do we do?&quot; Sylvia asks. The panic flashes in her eyes, but Lyra remains calm, turning to the Chymaerans with a trail of blood running from her forehead.
&quot;They&apos;ll think we&apos;re escapees that are hiding out in a storage car,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;We can&apos;t walk from here. Not at night, and not in the cold when we have so far still to go.&quot;
A voice thunders from the front of the train. Each syllable trembles in the floorboards, shaking loose fasteners like chattering teeth. &quot;There&apos;a nowhere to run. Stay inside the train or else you will freeze and die.&quot; 
Escape is futile without the directional sense that leads you home &mdash; or a map like the one my grandfather left me of the lands beyond the wall. No wonder they outlawed that magnetic tool Everett had that points towards the city, saying it&apos;s an &quot;item that dishonors the unified spirit of Blackwater.&quot;
Lyra turns to the Chymaerans. &quot;Play this off if they ever come by.&quot; They emerge from the corner, creatures of darkness whose bodies seem to soak all the light. But my eyes have adjusted and I see them now: hard-shelled flesh like steel armor, a triangle of three glowing, amethyst dots on their heads I can only interpret as eyes.
A vibration shudders from deep within their throat, as if their vocal cords were feathered by the fronds of a comb instead of a violin&apos;s bow. The sound takes shape until it morphs into human speech, and I realize the sheer range of mastery these half-blood Chymaerans have with guising.
And just like them, I&apos;ve changed in an instant, too: furious now with my waning patience for how many distractions tear me from any moment of peace."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Slaughter","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Nine","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Twenty-Eight","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":9,"ChapterFull":28,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":89,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"86","Synopsis":"The survivors realize the ultimate purpose of the unexceptional graduates.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.28","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

I poke my head out of the car, just enough to take in a flash of information.
&quot;How did they get to the emergency stop?&quot; a half-blood guard says, still in human form.
&quot;They didn&apos;t,&quot; another says. &quot;We found a metal rod jammed in the wheels from part of the trolley frame.&quot;
Three cabins down, the car has its door thrown open. &quot;Run and you&apos;ll go nowhere, shitbloods! I don&apos;t have to kill you now to know you&apos;ll die out there,&quot; he says.
&quot;Damn you! All we have to do is take this train over,&quot; a cadet says.
&quot;Make it an example,&quot; a Guard demands. 
My curiosity draws me beyond the edge of the doorframe again. The Cadet is lifted into the air, his flesh surging bright amethyst. And it&apos;s only after I notice the height his feet hang from the ground that I see how massive this Chymaeran is. 
&quot;The convenient thing about fuel like this is that it&apos;s all out of Essence. So those small diseases of the past,&quot; the Guard continues, watching the Chymaeran brute choke out the rebel as his flesh grows pale, &quot;are enough to turn a cough to cancer.&quot;
The dark, glowing amethyst trail reaches the cadet&apos;s heart from his neck. In a matter of moments his body dissolves to blackened ash. His raw Essence is absorbed into the circuits of his abuser.
It&apos;s then that all the cadets&apos; restraint dissolves, leaving nothing but the hatred and primal fury of fighters that were bred to die. It takes so little effort for the lone Chymaeran brute to eviscerate everything that breathes in the train car, and although I don&apos;t see the bloodbath, I can hear the sound of slender limbs slicing flesh; the drumming beat of cadets as their bodies fall, reduced to dust, filling this creature with the soul and fleeting strength of the dead.
My anger builds further, as if their last stand has spread the contagion of furious spite. I can&apos;t care for death when I know time will reset me, even if it&apos;s to this exact moment that rage primes my muscles.
The guards now approach us. I know the sacrifice I have to make, and I know I have to stop them. I won&apos;t die a martyr like Romin if I can&apos;t die: all I want is to release the vitriol that poisons my heart. 
My hands tension around the shaft of a fire axe left on the ground of the train car. My mind is set. But a hand tugs on the back of my coat when I step off the platform.
&quot;What are you doing, Titus?&quot; Sylvia asks. &quot;Don&apos;t just throw your life away!&quot; 
But I won&apos;t just throw it away. I can&apos;t. Not now and not ever again. I won&apos;t need warmth for the short struggle that comes next: my body burns hot with adrenaline and excitement, as if that edge of life and death is an addictive drug that I&apos;ve relapsed on.
I shed the coat.&quot;You can&apos;t throw away eternal life,&quot; I say. I tried to explain it to her, to all of them, though I know she will never understand. 
My hands tension further until my knuckles turn whiter than the snow, frosted skin redder than the blood of those cadets that didn&apos;t turn to ash quick enough. The Vassal skips a train car to approach, thinking me another stupid cadet that wants to die. But all I want is to leverage that unfillable, longing emptiness through my fists. 
And that fury must be genetic.
The tears I shed over and over a day ago refill my eyes, trembling my voice as I cry out. And although the Chymaeran Curse scalds my flesh with violent heat, surging stronger in my veins as they approach, I know this will be a short conflict.
It&apos;s too late to turn back when the Vassal charges, still famished for Life Essence to feed, the very image of Lionshead&apos;s wickedness incarnated before me, preparing for that day atop the mountain when all of Blackwater&apos;s life Essence will flood them with the power of two races.
I scream my treasured sister&apos;s name as a battle cry, unbundling with it the curses and vitriol of helpless anger as a useless brother and worse friend. I swing first with all my might, channeling all the strength I can into the head of the axe, although the muscles in my right arm are strained from amethyst pain. I don&apos;t care that the dark roots have already crawled my arm and up my shoulder. 
All I care is that this ends.
It&apos;s like swinging at a rigid metal bar when it shields itself with its arms. The <em>clang</em> of that strike vibrates through my hands, echoing through the forest, and I hear the cheers of cadets in a lower train car, shouting my name, as they saw me moments earlier at Graduation.
 Despite a story of height, the Vassal looks genuinely scared, but that doesn&apos;t stop it from dealing eviscerating blows. Drawn back by the momentum of the large axe, I stagger backwards, taking the wooden shaft in both my hands to block.
It makes sounds as if trying to speak, surely insulting me and my pettiness.
I dive to the side when the serrated edge slashes down on me. Dirt and snow erupt from the ground like lakewater splashing from a falling boulder. My vision is consumed by powder, but I charge forward anyways, channeling all that fury into another swing at nothing.
I&apos;m lucky when it connects. The great Chymaeran is furious now, as if it wasn&apos;t before, but it still refuses to use all its strength. Probably to put on a show of little effort for its handlers, I think, before its first connecting swing shatters the butt of the axe, nearly whacking me off my feet.
Lyra holds back Sylvia, insisting that I&apos;m &quot;already lost and beyond saving.&quot; I can feel the crack propagate when I strike again: the wooden shaft has hardly any metal left to hold on to. 
My strike deals just as much damage as it did before. Absolutely nothing. Maybe a scratch, more just an annoyance, but my mission isn&apos;t to win.
The attack I&apos;ve waited for comes after my hands strain from all hard metal contact. I reach, weakly, to block with the wooden throat of the axe, but the force behind the Chymaeran&apos;s blade shatters it like a toothpick. 
I&apos;m surprised, but not by its raw power. With such force, its downward strike never even reaches the ground. I look down at my chest: a large crimson line traces from my left shoulder to my right hip. I grasp my chest, expecting my insides to spill, but I&apos;m surprised when the wound is only skin deep. My father always taught me to swing through your target, not just to make contact, and with all the bisected torsos of cadets in the train car I can see now, it&apos;s undeniable. 
The Vassal is pulling punches.
My fight is over as soon as I fall to my back, and the great obsidian beast stands over me. I don&apos;t have the stamina to flinch when one of the sharp edges of its arms stabs into the shoulder of my bad arm, pinning me against the ground. 
I expect it could dice me to shreds like all those other cadets, but all I can see is the pain of this creature. It trembles with an unsettling fear for something so large, as if it tries to speak again. 
I can&apos;t move. All I can feel is the amethyst probing further into my blood. The pain subsides as my nerves no longer feel the cold of the wasteland. My arms and legs no longer hinge. My muscles refuse to budge as my breaths grow shallower, and I realize the vassal has granted me a merciful death.
I have taken in my surroundings: where the Royal Guards are and where they wait. Now that I know the purpose of this train, we will escape long before it halts, that is &mdash; if the thread can take me back far enough.
&quot;I . . . hunger,&quot; it manages, and I don&apos;t make the words out until it leaves.
I can feel my strength wane as I lay in the snow. The Royal Guard return to their carriages as the Chymaerans, Lyra, and Sylvia rush to recover me in the last minute."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":60,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":9,"ChapterFull":28,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":60,"Index":91,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"Written","Keywords":"","UUID":"88","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Titus reveals what he witnessed in other lives.

It takes several seconds before I can lift myself from the hay bales in the corner of the train car. The rhythm of the carriage returns beneath me, and when the pain of the slash across my chest comes back, I contemplate how unlucky I am to be alive.
&quot;What were you thinking?&quot; Sylvia asks.
&quot;I just wanted to save you all,&quot; I said, but they don&apos;t seem to accept my version of the truth. I repeat it. &quot;Someone had to do something. To protect all of you. I gave myself so you could live! So you can tell your people what you&apos;ve learned.&quot; But Sylvia and Lyra aren&apos;t grateful.
&quot;You weren&apos;t doing it to save us. I saw that look in your eyes,&quot; Lyra says.
&quot;You were trying to kill yourself,&quot; Sylvia says. She tensions her fingers around my shirt, jolting me as I weakly sprawl against the hay bales. &quot;Why, why would you do that?&quot;
I could tell her it was the guilt from letting Romin and Valentina die, forcing them to be a sacrifice. But when Lyra saw my resolve in letting go, she knew I was resolute in my decision. They wouldn&apos;t understand. They can never understand. But I have to tell them something to get what I want, to get to that sacrifice I have to make, so that I can save everyone I love from being less than cattle to the Afterlife. If this life is so inconsequential, then why is it so hard?
Sylvia treads further on the subject I try so hard to avoid. &quot;What did you mean when you said those words, that &apos;you can&apos;t throw away eternal life?&apos;&quot;

&quot;I can return. Over and over and over. If I die, I can go back and change the outcome,&quot; I say. &quot;So if I die in the process of protecting you, then it doesn&apos;t matter.&quot;
&quot;Doesn&apos;t matter? All you&apos;re doing is just throwing yourself away,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;You&apos;re not a tool or a means to an end, you&apos;re a person!&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m cursed with the knowledge of how everything will end. You can&apos;t even begin to understand what I carry with me when I&apos;m responsible for everything!&quot; I turn to Lyra. &quot;You came to Blackwater to seek Fletcher after the column of light erupted in the sky. Ten years ago he died saving your life. I told you the trade building would be destroyed, and I wasn&apos;t lying, because I witnessed it the last time, and I did absolutely nothing because I was too afraid. And even the second time around, I still let all those innocent children die.&quot;
&quot;Then why did you leave our friends to die without a moment of regret,&quot; Sylvia says, &quot;flipping the hatch of the basement door and deciding for all of us if we would try to save them?&quot;
&quot;Because I did try,&quot; I tell her. &quot;I lived the same ten minute period over and over, for days and days and days until it broke every part of me that still wanted to hope. How could I come up with something so crafty in so little time? Do you know how many things I tried?&quot; My voice begins to waver but I don&apos;t care. &quot;I held back Romin. I reached to drag Valentina. I ran out the door with them, only to be shot like a stray dog. I tried every combination of words that might ever convince them, but it was as if fate, not our friends, had polarized them on that decision. So I had to say goodbye to them. I had, and have, to be absolute in my decision&mdash;without hesitation&mdash;or else you and I will never get to see them again.&quot;
It doesn&apos;t matter whether they fully believe me. These people are just figments of a past that will soon be forgotten. All I care about is the Essence Lyra promised for joining the First Red beyond the walls, and I have to believe that is still an option.
I turn to Lyra. &quot;I have no idea what they plan to do with the thousands of cadets they&apos;re sending beyond the walls. But I know that the great black tar of Endogeny is soon to liquidate the city of all Essence: every woman, child, and man whose generations of life were only lived to be culled like cattle. Three months from now, when Endogeny runs its full course, the Heiress of Purgatory will accept the blessing of the Gods, becoming the first cross-blood Chosen. And not a single life will be spared when all is covered in ash and lava.&quot;
All my choices have been played out, and the longer this cycle drags me, the further I stretch away from a chance of that idyllic future.
 Sylvia looks at my bare arm and notices something is missing.
&quot;It&apos;s gone,&quot; she says.
&quot;What&apos;s gone?&quot;
&quot;The Chymaeran curse, it&apos;s gone!&quot;
I look in disbelief. People always notice when pain arrives, but not when it subsides. My arm still holds the threaded slashes from all the cycles. But the scar from Ellie&apos;s room no longer saturates my flesh in a deep-purple trail. 
All that remains is just the faint line where the flesh was severed.
&quot;I&apos;ve never seen a weakblood make a full recovery,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;How can that be possible?&quot;
I remember the Vassal&apos;s edge that stabbed me to the ground. I couldn&apos;t feel anything after the strike. All I remember was the creature&apos;s reluctance to leave, probably desiring to return for me later when I&apos;m at full strength, when I could give it a fair fight.
&quot;Anyways,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;We&apos;re almost there.&quot;
&quot;But where&apos;s the stop?&quot; Sylvia asks.
&quot;There is no stop,&quot; Lyra says.

By the time I raise my head, the train has already vanished into the blizzard, carrying the helpless cadets towards whatever horror awaits them. Lyra&apos;s dried Essence powder lines our gear: its warmth enough to last us for several hours.<em> Just long enough to get within range,</em> she says. <em>The First Red will know we</em>&apos;<em>re here long before we ever find them.</em>
The five of us tread on the virgin ice of an ancient snowstorm, our boots crunching snow sheets that were shaped by persistent winds long before our grandfathers&apos; first breath. Lyra urges us to move faster. The snowfall inundates the space between us. The only sense we have to acknowledge each other&apos;s presence is inference, stuck in an endless white room, as if torn from existence and stranded in the space between realities.
My beard is crystallized with strands of ice, but my core is warm from the powdered dead Essence. It feels if I move any faster that my lungs will bleed. But&apos;s preferable to our fate if we don&apos;t find shelter from the storm.
My body is far beyond the walls, but I find that my mind and soul are snagged elsewhere, far up the current of this reality&apos;s stream.
<em>This is all just a dream,</em> I tell myself, and I have been telling myself for hours now, repeating the same mantra, never forgetting the ones I failed to save, the look on their faces before and after their souls departed for the Reservoir. This reality is not mine. I am the branch of a different tree grafted on to this one. 
And when I have my chance, I will do whatever it takes to return to that true life.
I watch a shivering smudge enter my ivory headspace, walking shoulder-to-shoulder as we break the tree line of an expansive field. I expect it to be her, but I know she still hasn&apos;t fully forgiven me. Thick pine branches like eyelashes batter out a small fraction of the powder, just enough to make out her cherry-red nose beneath barricades of fabric.
&quot;Even threatened by the end of Blackwater, I&apos;m still not sure this will be enough to convince them.&quot; Lyra motions to the pack strapped behind her. &quot;They find every reason to hide and wait, as if it&apos;s an act of valor.&quot;
I don&apos;t respond.
&quot;What was Everett like to you?&quot; She asks. Even in a rare moment of frosted peace, she still can&apos;t stand the silence.
&quot;More of a father than Clint ever was,&quot; I say.
&quot;The only thing my father and I have in common is how much we hate him,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;After the Snowdrifters attacked our home, he refused to ever see Everett again. Everett fled to the city. Now we know he changed his last name over guilt, wishing to forget what he allowed to happen. And my father took me to the Afterlife, where as purebloods, we were welcomed with open arms.&quot;
&quot;The Afterlife has anything you could want. How did you end up here?&quot; I ask. &quot;What could ever possibly make you want to leave that life?&quot;
&quot;Because of how my father began to change,&quot; she says. &quot;Because I hadn&apos;t spent my whole life there. It wasn&apos;t normal to me. And all those desperate people I saw living on the edge of the walls, that day we made for the central peaks&mdash;the sick feeling of guilt never left me. Gods, I wonder how many of those purebloods have even seen the people whose necks they step on.&quot;
&quot;What happened to Ullrich?&quot; I ask.
&quot;Ever since the day he left us in the care of our uncle and aunt to visit the Afterlife, his personality changed. It changed before his feet even reached the porch. It looked as if he aged a hundred years, though his flesh showed no new wrinkles. And these episodes. Maybe it was the grief, how much he held it inside, but he&apos;d have these sudden panic attacks, prompted by nothing at all. And after every single one, his soul would age further, until one day it was as if he had nothing left.&quot;
She heaves for breath. Somewhere behind, Sylvia and the two Chymaerans trail us.
&quot;And when did you leave?&quot; I ask.
&quot;I left at the age of seventeen,&quot;she said. &quot;Ullrich wasn&apos;t even looking after me anymore, so obsessed with his role as Grandmaster General that I&apos;m sure he didn&apos;t even notice. It was so strange, though . . . you know that expression when you&apos;re reeling up to take a punch, when you harden your muscles and hold your breath? It&apos;s the only expression he wore for the last three months I was with him.&quot;
&quot;He was afraid,&quot; I say.
&quot;But of what? There&apos;s nothing out there. Most of the Chymaera around here are either allied to the First Red or living silently as refugees, taking the guise of the recently passed. That extremist image is more-so an invention of the Afterlife.&quot;
I check the tension of my own muscles, hardened much the same way, but not because of the cold. My back and neck haven&apos;t ached this bad since the hardest quarters of the Academy, and not even the trials of combat have strained them this far. An image haunts me just like Ullrich. She drags behind me in person and mind: the curtain call of failure, and I can feel entropy and fate draw us closer.
&quot;How do you gain Essence?&quot; I ask.
&quot;Huh?&quot; Lyra says.
&quot;Essence. How can you get it? Is it only through taking another person&apos;s life?&quot;
&quot;Essence is in everything around us. It&apos;s in everything that is alive. Killing is the most efficient way: it&apos;s why our ancestors raged in wars against each other for power. But it can also be transferred &mdash; at nearly a hundredth of killing&apos;s efficiency,&quot; she says. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;
I peek behind me. The snowstorm obscures her form. 
&quot;I need to get stronger.&quot;
&quot;The First Red will make you strong. You don&apos;t need Essence to have strength,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;It takes generations to build it. All we have now is generations of Essence built and taken by the lucky survivors of a long-past war.&quot;
&quot;And that&apos;s it?&quot;
&quot;No. You can also cultivate it. We kill and consume plants and animals every day. You can take advantage of nature &mdash; putting it in the mulch and feed of plants and livestock &mdash; but it&apos;s a lot slower.&quot;
&quot;There&apos;s just some people I need to be sure I can protect when I return,&quot; I say.
&quot;You&apos;ll have the strength of all the Carmine and First Red when we go back,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;We will have strength together, in our numbers.&quot;
&quot;Sure,&quot; I tell her, though I know that strength of others will never be enough. I&apos;m not going back with them. I&apos;m returning alone, in my own way.
The blinding barrage of flakes begins to taper just as the dead Essence lining our clothes wears down.
&quot;The storm is clearing,&quot; I tell her. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen the weather change this fast out here!&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s not nature that causes that,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;The Afterlife would be a frostbitten wasteland if nature had its way. It means we&apos;re almost there.&quot;
She&apos;s right. Every hundred yards I feel my insulated clothes grow hotter, and after a while, the sheets of frost no longer crunch, reduced to slush. There&apos;s a clearing somewhere far past the trees, and with my eyes, I can  make out small strands of something sticking from the snowbanks.
The frost grows shallower, giving way to another change I had only ever seen riding the Academy gondola to get closer to the Afterlife. The strands are cereal grasses, dry and yellow like vagrants&apos; teeth. Only half a day or so past that house Romin and I could barely reach, and the sight captivates me.
&quot;Spoken-word stories tell us that this is what Blackwater looked like before the fall,&quot; Lyra says. She lifts her hands and falls to her knees, anticipating something neither Sylvia or I can see.
Their voices cry out, and I only begin to notice when I hear them. Their bodies refract the light with scales like polished, transparent glass. I blink them away at first as if they&apos;re just a smudge in my eye, but as they approach closer, I can see their footsteps: the only evidence ten of them leave behind.
We all drop to our knees, tossing our gear to the ground.
&quot;State your business, or be executed where you stand,&quot; one calls out. &quot;There is no return from here.&quot;
&quot;They&apos;re with me,&quot; Lyra says. 
&quot;And what have you found?&quot;
&quot;We bring a message for the Elders: the message we&apos;ve all been waiting for,&quot; she insists."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":62,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":10,"ChapterFull":29,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":62,"Index":94,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"Written","Keywords":"","UUID":"91","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Raine refuses to believe what they say.

The villagers are restive when we pass, so accustomed to crimson cloaks and Carmine cloth that our tall-collared Academy jackets are inscrutable. Even as the highest-honored legends of Carmine lore, they cower like prey when their proxy is threatened, restlessly toeing the line between fight and flight.
They clear a path for us between the meager log buildings. Most still hold the tools of their trade, uprooted from their work by curiosity and commotion, the same expression of fright flushed across all of them, heating the ambient air more than the artificial climate ever could.
&quot;I&apos;ll handle this,&quot; Lyra says. 
I can tell we&apos;re close to whatever authority presides here from the way she slows down to collect her words. But the chieftains of the First Red approach first.
&quot;What is the meaning of this, Lyra? Is this some kind of joke? A stunt?&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s none of those things,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Please, listen. They&mdash;&quot;
&quot;&mdash;Are going to be killed because of your insolence. Did you even think if they might be followed? Who are these people? You know the rules, Lyra. We don&apos;t keep twenty years of airtight silence by inviting strangers here!&quot;
&quot;They&apos;re the reason I&apos;m here to bring this message.&quot; Lyra&apos;s words fall on selectively deaf ears.
&quot;That&apos;s why I&apos;m sorry for what we have to do, whether you are spies of the Afterlife or just poor civilians of greater Blackwater. It&apos;s one of our tenants,&quot; he says, spitefully eyeing Lyra, &quot;that no outsider of the First Red, even brothers and sisters of the Blackwater Carmine, can ever know where we are.&quot;
I watch another familiar face approach in curiosity. I remember his name in an instant.
&quot;Just because you have the bloodline of the Mask doesn&apos;t mean you can do whatever you want, Lyra,&quot; The Chieftain says.
&quot;We have a message of the end of Blackwater. Please, just listen,&quot; I say.
&quot;We get those every other month, child,&quot; he says. &quot;But from <em>our</em> messengers. Chymaeran, cross-blooded Brothers and Sisters that have trained their whole lives for this. But please, go on.&quot;
I open my mouth to speak, but Lyra goes first.
&quot;It&apos;s time for us to return. The Afterlife has made its move.&quot;
&quot;Doubtful.&quot;
&quot;The Afterlife is in possession of a source of Pure Essence,&quot; Lyra says.
&quot;And so what? It does nothing to anyone without a divine lineage of blood. That&apos;s no reason for them to do anything.&quot; Raine steps forward.
&quot;But that&apos;s the thing. They have a vassal that will accept both the Human and Chymaeran blessing of the Mask.&quot;
&quot;But that&apos;s impossible!&quot; Raine says. &quot;How?&quot;
&quot;They found my brother,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;They drained his blood and Essence. And they made some abomination they plan to unleash on all the city, destroying everything!&quot;
&quot;Your brother is dead, Lyra,&quot; Raine says. His irritation feels more like habit than a sudden outburst. &quot;You saw them bury him. He&apos;s rotted away for years! His grave is only empty because of foxes and wolves.&quot; He turns to Sylvia and I. &quot;What&apos;s to say these aliens aren&apos;t Chymaerans from the Afterlife, that they didn&apos;t take some poor cadet&apos;s guise and wear their flesh?&quot; He eyes the necklace pendant my mother gave me. Surprise flushes his face, only convinced further of the story he&apos;s spun.
Raine approaches me. He reaches to the black crystal around my neck and yanks it. It snaps at the enclosure.
&quot;Look! Why else would these strangers carry Guise Tokens if they weren&apos;t masking themselves as poor civilians?&quot;
&quot;That&apos;s from my mother,&quot; I tell him. &quot;It&apos;s just a necklace!&quot;
&quot;This is a Guise Token. It only looks different because this is how they made them decades ago &mdash; you get a sample of the victim&apos;s flesh and bone and let it dissolve in pure Chymaeran Essence. This one&apos;s unprocessed, amateur work. This could only work two or three times before it failed.&quot;
I feel an amethyst energy that plagued me once before return to my entire body. I look to the side, and Sylvia&apos;s face flushes with the same anguish. They plan to kill us here.
&quot;Commander Zebal, please!&quot; says Lyra.
&quot;Zebal?&quot; The words escape my mouth. &quot;Like Romin? And Ryder?&quot;
He signals for the Chymaeran militiamen to stop. &quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; he says, before disbelief flushes his expression again. &quot;How would you know that?&quot;
&quot;Romin was in our fireteam,&quot; I say.
He scratches his beard, fumbling through faded memories. All he remembers is how much he&apos;s forgotten.
Sylvia says, &quot;He was brave and honorable.&quot;
&quot;Was?&quot; Raine looks defeated. &quot;What do you mean by that? Why isn&apos;t he with you, then?&quot; The name is foreign and unrehearsed to him. I see a light glimmer in his eyes, and I regret being the one to snuff it out.
&quot;He&apos;s the reason we made it here. Romin . . . died, so that the three of us could live.&quot; 
<em>Lies. His death was stupid and meaningless.</em>
&quot;He died a hero, honoring the Twelfth Province Carmine he gave all his soul and effort to.&quot;
<em>He died a martyr!</em>
I thought Raine would be heartbroken, but to him, his sons&apos; names have almost been reduced to an anecdote.
&quot;Names are just names, kid. You can spin any convincing yarn when you take the faces of the dead,&quot; he says, fiddling with my guise token between his fingers. &quot;Tell me something only I would know. What do you know about my sons?&quot;
&quot;Romin was just as stuck-up and arrogant as you are. He made his whole life mission to take up leadership in the First Red when you died. He lived in the shadow of you and his brother Ryder, always asking himself if his efforts and achievements were enough,&quot; I say.
The Militiamen release their grasp and give us the room to stand.
&quot;He told us his earliest memory of you,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;You were teaching him swordplay. He always told you it was stupid, that guns made swords obsolete. But then you told him it was a metaphor. That keeping it sharp was a symbol of renewed honor, and just that word changed his mind completely.&quot;
&quot;I remember, too,&quot; I say. &quot;And the next day, he found the sword you planned to give him as a gift. Early in the lighttime, he took it to the Compound&apos;s shop. You probably awoke to the loud screeching of metal and panicked Carmine trying to stop the husky kid from taking over the edge grinder. He was ruining the perfect edge of the blade, saying it would bring him more honor.&quot;
Raine&apos;s gaze grows distant, but he refuses the tears much like his own son, keeping his face stoic and humorless.
&quot;Your son was in love,&quot; I say. &quot;With another member of our fireteam. A Merlotan Royal, to be exact.&quot;
The Militiamen and Lyra chortle. Even the other Chieftains consider it too stupid and absurd to be false.
&quot;Those two dysfunctional oafs were in love?&quot; Lyra asks.
&quot;And how in Khiras&apos; name would that happen?&quot; Raine asks.
&quot;Because Fireteams were chosen at random. It was the year after he thought you died that we were assigned our fireteams,&quot; Sylvia said.
&quot;So please. We don&apos;t plan to leave, but to stay forever and contribute to this village. Our mission is yours: to save Blackwater in any way we can.&quot;
Raine turns to the other Chieftains. &quot;Everything they&apos;ve said is true, and it checks out,&quot; he says. &quot;Even the best-trained Chymaeran couldn&apos;t dig those details out of a guise.&quot;
&quot;Then what do you propose?&quot;
&quot;Let&apos;s give them a shot,&quot; Raine says. &quot;Lyra&apos;s reckless in bringing them here, but they know a lot that we don&apos;t.&quot;
&quot;You just want to hear more about your boy,&quot; one whispers.
&quot;If the worst case is that someone tailed them, we&apos;ll be handling that anyway, regardless of what we decide.&quot; He speaks louder so we can overtly hear. &quot;If they try to escape without fear, they&apos;ll die as frosthards. And if they breach our trust, we&apos;ll put them out the same way we intended to.&quot;
The others nod.
&quot;I call a vote among the twelve First Red Chieftains of the twelve provinces. Twelve proposes these aliens be recognized as brother and sister of the First Red.&quot; He turns to them. &quot;What say you, &apos;aye&apos; or &apos;nay?&apos;&quot;
The response is audibly settled. There&apos;s no reason not to accept us in.
&quot;Then, for the first time in the history of the First Red, we welcome you as Brother...&quot;
He turns to Lyra.
&quot;Titus and Sylvia.&quot;
&quot;Brother Titus and Sister Sylvia,&quot; he says. &quot;Do you accept this honor?&quot;
&quot;I do,&quot; I respond.
&quot;We do,&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;Then from this moment on, the Committee of the Twelve recognizes you as provisional trainees to the Carmine,&quot; Raine says. &quot;As in, you must earn our trust and respect. If you fall in any breach of that&mdash;and I mean anything&mdash;your title, and life, will be subject to termination.&quot;
&quot;Understood,&quot; I say.
&quot;As pledges from District Twelve, I will oversee your education.&quot; He gestures to a chieftain with gray braids beside him. &quot;The ninth chieftain, Lorne, will see to your housing in the barracks.&quot;
&quot;Thank you for your clemency,&quot; I say.
&quot;This will be the furthest from a life of leisure, Titus and Sylvia. The life of the furthest edgelander in Blackwater, nearest to the frigid walls of the outer lands, pales in comparison to the demand of every Backwood villager, and yours will be especially heavy.&quot;
&quot;We understand,&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;Then welcome to the land of the true Carmine,&quot; Raine says. His extension of provisional trust is admirable, and though Sylvia seems contented with the freedom of a new life, I can only think of the past and everything I owe to the ones I allowed to die.

As we tour the quaint village, Lyra tells us the land of the Backwoods is filled with Carmine who have lived more than a thousand lives combined. For the pure blood humans, it&apos;s two: the life before the Royal Guard overtook their lands, and the life after. But for those with <em>some</em> Chymaeran blood &mdash; the rare ones split between both sides of life and death as a living paradox &mdash; they live the lives of many, providing the First Red the intel they need by borrowing the likeness of long-forgotten dead.
&quot;So how many half-bloods are there?&quot; Sylvia asks.
&quot;Very few,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Their existence alone is an anomaly. They are the only ones that can last for years in their transitioned form.&quot; She nods to the two behind us, who still persist in the form of Valentina and Romin. &quot;They&apos;re half-bloods, too. They&apos;ve been watching over me in Blackwater for the whole trip.&quot;
&quot;But do they remember anything of our . . . friends?&quot; Sylvia asks. &quot;Do they hold only the most recent memories, or just pieces of the strongest ones?&quot;
&quot;The longer they stay that way, the better they get. But they will never have the full likeness of the person they take.&quot;
&quot;Because there&apos;s something I&apos;ve wanted to ask. If the real ones I called my friends are . . . gone, even if it&apos;s not really them or they don&apos;t remember anything,&quot; Sylvia says, &quot;can I say goodbye to them? One last time?&quot;
&quot;Sure, you can ask them,&quot; Lyra says. She&apos;s surprised as I am. The two impostors shrug, and I hate that I can almost see a sliver of my old friends inside them.
&quot;They&apos;re not our friends, Sylvia. They can&apos;t replace them,&quot; I mutter to her, under my breath, but she ignores me. She turns to the Romin and Valentina that know so little of their pasts, as if amnesia has overtaken them. Neither have the mannerisms we remember, as their bodies are a vacant shell transplanted with a different soul. I can tell Sylvia waited for this cathartic moment since the desire came to her in the train car, a chance to fully let go. 
She weeps with everything she has when she embraces them, as if she really, truly had the chance to say goodbye one last time. I hear her whisper the words she reserved for them the whole time we hid in the cellar. I live it through her. I can&apos;t bring myself to do it. Because to me they&apos;re still alive, waiting on the other side of twenty-one hours and twelve minutes, in a single frame, still completely unaware of what awaits them and frozen like insects trapped in amber.
But then she insists.&quot;You have your chance, Titus. Join us one last time to feel through that grief,&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;But it&apos;s not them, Sylvia. You should know that. It isn&apos;t the same.&quot;
&quot;But your heart needs something to process. You have to grieve it all in that fleeting moment you can. Come on! Release every last ounce of that sorrow that drags at you. And finally, when you know you&apos;ve tried, can you begin to heal.&quot;
&quot;I can&apos;t. Acceptance might be your only choice, but it&apos;s never been for me.&quot; She doesn&apos;t understand the anguish that awaits me. I pity her naivety and weakness. 
&quot;Just once,&quot; she insists. &quot;And I&apos;ll never ask again.&quot;
&quot;Fine,&quot; I say. I approach the Chymaerans who wear the faces of my friends, and I feel those dangerous emotions surge within me. I don&apos;t deserve this opportunity to say goodbye when it was my decision that condemned them to their fate. I&apos;m pathetic and expendable without&mdash;
Sylvia pulls me in. I can feel the warmth of Sylvia&apos;s body heat my skin although Romin and Valentina remain cold. They feel exactly like how I last abandoned them, both immortalized in a way they never expected. This Valentina feels just as small and squishy and fragile as I last remember her. Romin is the same statuesque boulder. This forbidden comfort is a catharsis I can&apos;t yet afford. Gods. This touch is a drug, but all I huff now are the fumes of the secondhand past that still follows me, and the more I stay, the less I want to let go.
Lyra&apos;s left in an uncomfortable silence. &quot;Well . . . I&apos;ve got to report in to the Chieftains.  Lorne should have prepared your space by now in the barracks. Familiarize yourself with this place: it will be your home and new life until we return. And when you&apos;re familiarized, go to the Barracks to settle in.&quot;
Sylvia and I let go. She insists on staying, though the discomfort of embracing these guising actors begs me to leave.
&quot;Let&apos;s look around,&quot; I tell Sylvia. It&apos;s our first chance to take in the disbelief of this verdant enclave beyond the walls. The first thought I have is of all the illustrations in Everett&apos;s books of plants and lush grass. But now I can touch it. I can experience the sensation of the wild grasses and verdant spaces,  beauty far different from the over-manicured lawns of the Afterlife, and the closer I walk to the center of this place, the more I&apos;m unable to tell where the village ends and nature begins.
The snow has melted. A radiant sun shines through with a chill breeze. I ask a local where the snow went. It&apos;s the Essence of this place: present in the circuits of the villagers, enough to raise crops at inconceivable speeds to feed the masses, the only reason they can possibly survive out here. It&apos;s vested in their own fractal of Pure Essence in the Chieftains&apos; Lodge. And it&apos;s buried in the soil, changing the very climate of this small enclave of frozen wasteland.
He tells us that Blackwater was once this beautiful, full of pine forests that spanned for ages with huts nestled in between. It&apos;s a past he doesn&apos;t remember. All he has is the spoken word of history that&apos;s forbidden in the mainland. 
We stop for a moment to hear the silence of the wind as it passes through the trees. My nose is no longer too cold and stuffed to smell, so for the first time in forever I take in the aroma of cedar and pine.
It&apos;s all so beautiful and wonderful, but I can&apos;t allow myself the comfort of enjoyment. I watch Sylvia make peace with this birthright that was taken from us, sprawled out across a field of tall grass, watching clouds pass in the sky high above. And it&apos;s a new sight for me too. It only motivates me further to bring back this experience for all of them, so that we can share the same dream.
A group of half-blood Chymaerans approach, two of them still wearing the faces of Romin and Valentina. From Valentina&apos;s hand dangles my necklace. 
Their voices transition from vibrating clicks to human speech. 
&quot;You never answered at the Cheiftains&apos; Lodge. Why do you have an identity marker?&quot; the Romin asks.
&quot;I never knew it was,&quot; I say. It&apos;s so strange addressing Romin when his mannerisms are entirely different. But I can see a notable change compared to when they first wore his face.
&quot;Can I borrow this?&quot; He asks.
A part of me is reassured they found it. 
&quot;You can have it. I don&apos;t need it or want it,&quot; I say. All I carry with me now is memory, not possessions. 
But I&apos;m still curious. 
&quot;Why do you want to borrow it?&quot;
&quot;I think I know the Chymaeran half-blood that used this. They mentioned they&apos;ve been missing one for a long time.&quot;
&quot;Sure,&quot; I say. I always considered its origin was somewhere beyond the walls, taken by Snowdrifters before I ever became one. None of those things ever get back to their original owner, because every run we&apos;re stealing from the dead.
&quot;The dead deserve respect for us to borrow their lives. It&apos;s sacred to the culture of true Chymaerans,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;To lose a guise is to lose an intimate connection &mdash; there&apos;s a lot I&apos;ve learned about this girl while I guised her.&quot;
&quot;Like what?&quot; says Sylvia. She no longer basks in the comfort of the fields.
&quot;When you start, it&apos;s as if you forget everything about who you really are. You have to remember that it&apos;s all just an appearance, just to separate yourself. It&apos;s brutal to remember a person&apos;s last traumas. The most recent memories come first, and so for this girl . . . &quot; Valentina says. Her words trail off, waiting for someone to pick them up.
Sylvia asks, &quot;Was it painless?&quot;
&quot;She was gone before she could think about it.&quot;
&quot;Oh.&quot; 
I turn to the Chymaeran guising Romin, but before I can ask the same question, they turn away. 
I ask anyway.
They respond, &quot;You don&apos;t want to know. It wasn&apos;t quick.&quot; They leave it at that. I don&apos;t ask further, knowing it might upset Sylvia.
&quot;Tell us,&quot; Sylvia insists. &quot;I want to know.&quot;
&quot;Romin was shot several times, but it wasn&apos;t the bullets that killed him. His last thoughts were regrets.&quot;
I think of his last words in my first life, pleading to the empty air for someone to remember him.
&quot;But why, why would he do that?&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;Because I wanted the perfect reason to die,&quot; Romin says, before correcting himself. &quot;Because <em>he</em> wanted . . . Gods above. Six hours and it feels like I&apos;m already becoming him.&quot;
Sylvia asks, &quot;How much can half-blood Chymaerans remember in a week? A month? Even years?&quot; And I can tell where she&apos;s going with this.
&quot;Longer than the person was alive, to achieve a fraction of their memories and personality,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;Most recent memories first, except for their most painful traumas.&quot;
&quot;I see,&quot; Sylvia says.
I felt the oddest comfort when I got over the initial surprise of seeing the two Chymaerans guising my cherished friends. But once they opened their mouths to speak and their joints postured in a body language I couldn&apos;t recognize, there&apos;s been a sickening uncanniness I can&apos;t shake.
The look of hope in Sylvia&apos;s eyes tells me she&apos;s on the edge of falling victim to this convincing illusion. To her, it&apos;s a chance to start over, but in reality it&apos;s the furthest thing from benign.
The Romin says, &quot;You&apos;ll be paired with us in the living halls since we&apos;ll be training you&mdash;since so much of all our lives were spent in District Twelve.&quot;
&quot;That&apos;s great!&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;And you&apos;ll be keeping this appearance?&quot;
&quot;If you wish,&quot; the Romin responds. <em>I know it</em>&apos;<em>s hard to resist looks this good,</em> I hear in my mind, but his face is stoic.
<em>Oh, shut up Romin! You</em>&apos;<em>re the last ugly face I</em>&apos;<em>d want to wake up to. </em>I crack a smile when I imagine Valentina&apos;s response, but she&apos;s dead-serious too.
&quot;There&apos;s an important meeting tonight held by the leaders of the First Red. You&apos;ll be introduced there. Gods above &mdash; there have been so many reports of you two as spies, it&apos;ll do us well to clear all of this up. Come to the North wall at sundown,&quot; Valentina says.
Romin spits out several parting words before they dissolve to clicks. &quot;We&apos;ll see you there. And enjoy your last day of freedom&mdash;there&apos;s a lot to catch you up on tomorrow.&quot;"},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Unsettled Glory","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Twelve","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Thirty-One","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":12,"ChapterFull":31,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":97,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"94","Synopsis":"They worship themselves in unpaid glory.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.31","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

The villagers of the Backwoods work late into the night. Hunters return from the lukewarm fringe of land where animals tread. There exists no ancient wall to separate us from nature, no hard boundary, but a gradient of frost that tapers off into the shaded darkness of the treeline.
I find that like it. Unlike the hedonistic civilians that indulge themselves behind their tall cobblestone walls, these villagers directly face that boundless, all-consuming darkness every night, reminding them of all they could lose at a moment&apos;s notice. I can feel the same edge in their fears of the Afterlife that I feel grow within myself, that bitter sickness like cancer that never leaves once it comes; a permanent ailment of the mind.
&quot;Titus,&quot; a voice calls. &quot;I&apos;ve been looking for you.&quot; It&apos;s Raine. He stands beside a great sled on the edge of the village as the darkness sets into the forest, talking with two tall hooded figures. Looking at their feet, I consider they have the strangest shoes, as if they stand on tall heels only exposing the lowest part of their toes, but the detail eludes me.
&quot;We have some time before the meeting. I wanted to talk with you for a while.&quot;
&quot;Sure,&quot; I offer, joining their conversation circle as they part to let me in. But my attention is fixed on the strange creatures my eyes can&apos;t reconcile, the slight hunching, looking as if dogs stand upright at full attention. Their eyes are piercing and slitted. Their bulky gloves are covered in fur. It&apos;s only when they withdraw their hoods that I realize what they are.
&quot;Human, look as if you&apos;ve seen a ghost,&quot; they say.
&quot;You&apos;re . . . Ahkvasans,&quot; I say.
&quot;I&apos;m impressed,&quot; Raine says. &quot;How do you even know that?&quot;
&quot;My grandfather hoarded illicit books of the old world. He insisted they weren&apos;t fairy tales, though everything that the Academy and Seminary taught us would say otherwise.&quot; I turn to them in disbelief, as if all pen-and-ink illustrations of my memory were given slender legs and angular faces. &quot;How did you even make it here? Where do you come from?&quot;
They motion to the sled, outfitted like a touring car with flat skis instead of wheels. &quot;Explorers, we are. From Melenia. Sent by Ja&apos;ada. This is the only northern village we can travel. Well-known by other lands. Supported by us. Cause is noble.&quot;
&quot;As we&apos;re the last Humans alive. Surely,&quot; I say. They laugh to themselves, muttering something in their own sharp-tongued language.
&quot;Walk with me,&quot; Raine says. &quot;Where&apos;s the other girl?&quot;
&quot;Still exploring. I didn&apos;t mean to leave her hanging, but I wanted to return to the barracks,&quot; I say. &quot;What do you need?&quot;
&quot;First is an Essence transfer. I also want to give you a quick personal tour,&quot; Raine says.
&quot;Thank you for your time, sir,&quot; I say, but I can tell the gnawing anticipation to learn his son&apos;s past would consume him if he didn&apos;t approach me eventually.
&quot;Call me Raine,&quot; he says. 
We wave to the Ahkvasans, still chattering on and laughing in their quick tongue. He stops for a moment and turns to face me.
&quot;I would have done this if you both were here. But you need some Essence to be helpful out here,&quot; he says.
&quot;You can transfer Essence?&quot;
&quot;It takes a lot to give a little. But when the elders die, they allow us to reclaim it all in their passing. Circle of life, or something like that, right?&quot; Raine says.
&quot;So you kill them first?&quot;
He laughs. &quot;No. Gods no, absolutely not. But when they die, there&apos;s a brief period that the Essence vacates their circuits. It shimmers in the air, faintly, like crystals of snow, so clear you almost can&apos;t see it, attracted to the nearest circuit-wielder like metal dust to a magnet. But if too much time passes, it condenses to dead Essence, falling to the ground where it&apos;s absorbed into the dirt.&quot;
I recall the great liquidation of Blackwater, the moment when Essence flooded through the cavern from all the victims of Endogeny. The flood of power I felt in my circuits, though only a hundredth of a hundredth of that great plume found me.
&quot;I&apos;ve never witnessed that before,&quot; I tell him.
&quot;I hope not,&quot; he says, laughing again. 
He exposes his hand. Near the bones on both sides of his wrist, I see two series of slashes that have worn there many times before. 
&quot;Are you ready? This won&apos;t hurt too much, I promise,&quot; he insists.
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; I say.
He withdraws a dagger. It glows hot like the can of beans did in Lyra&apos;s hand, cleansing the blade of any impurities. &quot;We need to air our blood for the transfer to happen. Hold my forearm. Line our wrists at the joint.&quot;
We hold each other&apos;s arms like a deep handshake. He slices the blade across both of our wrists at the side. The pain is quick. A small trickle of blood pools together at the crease of our light and dark flesh. By gravity, none of it returns to the slice to cross-contaminate, but I can see the faintest glow rise between us. 
Raine draws into his pocket with another hand, retrieving dead Essence, and he sprinkles it on the union of our blood. It stings of a familiar otherworldly force when it absorbs into the lesion. When the blood dries, he twists his wrist so that mine is on top, and an immense feeling of flux envelops me.
&quot;The Chieftains hold all the Essence of the dead so that it can be distributed efficiently,&quot; he says. &quot;But imagine this: even with all this Essence flooded in each of our circuits from the fallen, we don&apos;t even reach a tenth of what the average pureblood of the Afterlife has.&quot; His face is stoic again. &quot;Honor their sacrifice. Return to the graves of the deceased whose Essence you took to honor them. Somewhere in the reservoir, your words will reach them, and maybe, just maybe, it will guide them back to us in another life.&quot;
&quot;I will,&quot; I tell him. The feeling is electric. But it&apos;s nothing close to the magnitude of what I had in the Afterlife.
&quot;Soon you&apos;ll even be able to do this. Watch,&quot; he says. 
He turns his palm upward. His fingers glow like flesh pressed directly up to a flashlight, and in moments, a spark attenuates into a flame.
He finds joy in my expression of disbelief. &quot;You remind me of my son Ryder, the first time I showed him in the basement of the Compound. He pleaded for me to teach him, but I had to swear him to secrecy,&quot; Raine says. &quot;I never got the chance to show Romin.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m sure he would have been amazed,&quot; I tell him. &quot;It&apos;s our birthright as Humans. It&apos;s what we deserve.&quot;
&quot;Damn right,&quot; he says. &quot;Speaking of that, how does the Essence feel? It must be a strange new sensation to you.&quot;
&quot;It feels nice. I won&apos;t freeze when sleeping at night anymore, I can tell you that,&quot; I say.
&quot;Good,&quot; Raine says. He motions for me to follow him. &quot;Look&mdash;I&apos;m sorry how we reacted to your arrival. You have to understand how scared we were, how thin the ice is we tread on secrecy. You know why I left Blackwater?&quot;
I shake my head.
&quot;The First Red Chieftains phase through life terms. When one dies, another replaces them. It&apos;s a rare occurrence &mdash; you probably don&apos;t know how much a solid base of Essence prolongs the Human life &mdash; but when a chair is empty, they draw directly from the highest member of that Blackwater district.&quot;
&quot;It happened when Romin was three or so, I think I remember from what he told me,&quot; I say. &quot;You didn&apos;t have a choice, did you?&quot;
&quot;The Carmine pledge leaves no room to waver in uncertainty. You give all of yourself, everything that&apos;s asked of you. And the most taxing is time.&quot; He looks down at his weathered, cracked hands as we walk. &quot;I gave up a relationship with my sons. I had to die to them. They had everything in place to convincingly frame it, and it doesn&apos;t take much to convince the Merlot and the Afterlife&mdash;they were probably relieved,&quot; he says. &quot;My whole life here has been trying to make up for that. And I want you to know that, although this life will be hard, you will be safe and protected, well-taken-care-of and challenged.&quot; The words sound like they&apos;ve been rehearsed in his mind for ages, for someone he knew he&apos;d never meet.
&quot;And I&apos;ll honor whatever you need from me, Raine,&quot; I tell him.

Raine introduces me to half the village, and to any curious passerby that stares me down like how I glared at the Ahkvasans. He shows me the grueling labor of the farmers, able to harvest fully-grown plants in a mere two weeks by cheating the ecosystem with Essence. He shows the few young Carmine much like myself, strong with corded muscle much like Romin, enthusiastic to find another friend their age. And finally, we arrive to the Chieftains&apos; Lodge, where he takes me inside.
&quot;And this building here is the heart of all the Carmine, all we&apos;ve ever fought for. It&apos;s nothing compared to the great compounds we&apos;ve erected all around Blackwater proper, of course: all we have out here is logs instead of concrete. But this is the nexus from which all decisions spring, influencing the Carmine in Blackwater though ninety-nine-point-nine percent of their ranks don&apos;t even know we exist.&quot;
In the center of the floor is the shimmering fragment of something in a case. Now that enough Essence floods my circuits, I can sense it, and Raine notices.
&quot;A fragment of Pure Essence,&quot; he says. &quot;Legends say the Pure Essence comes straight from the Gods, before they banished themselves from this world and all its affairs.&quot; His eyes look beyond the windows for something, and then he tugs my shirt, bringing me to the window. &quot;You see that boulder out there? That one, by the tree.&quot;
&quot;What about it?&quot; 
It&apos;s about knee-height in diameter.
&quot;They say that&apos;s how much of this Pure Essence exists in the world. So much unaccounted for, so much we don&apos;t even know about, so much even locked away for safety, for mutually-assured destruction, hopefully never to be touched. It&apos;s the only fine connection we still have to the divine.&quot;
&quot;And it&apos;s the source of the climate,&quot; I say.
&quot;Smart,&quot; Raine says. &quot;A great part of it. Any more and we&apos;d stick out to the Afterlife. We have just enough to remain hidden in this endless snowstorm, the best cover we could ever ask for.&quot;
A Sister approaches from behind us, excusing her interruption before tapping me on the shoulder. 
&quot;This is yours, right?&quot; In her hand dangles the black, crystalline identity marker, suspended from a fixed clasp after Raine tore it from me. &quot;The Chymaeran-blooded brothers were excited for some reason after they asked to borrow it. These things are speculated about like treasures to Snowdrifters. It&apos;s part of their culture, I guess. But they gave up after they couldn&apos;t find whatever they were looking for.&quot;
&quot;Thanks,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;Chymaerans are strange creatures,&quot; Raine says. &quot;But then again, I guess we&apos;re strange to them, too.&quot;
 I tie the clasp back around my neck, and attuned more to the energies of the world around me, I feel the strangeness of its power as if a voice whispers in my mind."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":65,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":12,"ChapterFull":31,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":65,"Index":99,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"Written","Keywords":"","UUID":"96","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Committee.

The gathering has already begun in the amphitheater by the time Raine and I arrive. The Chieftains of the First Red scatter about the front benches as salt-and-pepper heads of hair in a sea of crimson cloaks. Behind them, villagers fill the outcropping seated on grass, rocks, or fallen logs, and to the sides of us, limestone slabs scrape the sky above the trees. The two natural walls meet at the bottom, where an outcropping of rocks have been cobbled into a stage.
Raine motions for me to sit next to him on the rear benches near the central aisle. I look for Sylvia or Lyra, the only other two faces I know, but the ruffled hair, tattered clothes, and sultry skin of the villagers blend them all into the foliage.
The twelfth chieftain&apos;s voice booms with enough resonance for us all to hear.
 &quot;Motion to discuss Essence allocation to agriculture has been tabled to next month&apos;s meeting,&quot; he says, and in a drawn pause of commotion, I ask Raine why he isn&apos;t up there with them. He tells me they switch off each week in hosting the gathering, allowing them to balance focus between provincial issues.
&quot;Next order of business,&quot; says the secretary. The cabinet scans for propositions.
&quot;Motion to discuss scouting literature for children,&quot; a female voice says.
&quot;That&apos;s for subcommittee discussion,&quot; the Chieftain says. &quot;Pressing issues. Large concerns. Thats what we discuss here. Anyone?&quot;
&quot;Motion to discuss housing conditions in the third barracks,&quot; another says. &quot;There&apos;s been a roof collapse, and&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Again, committee issue,&quot; he says, almost bored and agitated&mdash;but then again, everyone looks jaded and depressed.
Another young voice calls out. &quot;Motion to discuss the return to Blackwater,&quot;
The old men groan in the audience. &quot;No, not again. Sit down, Lyra!&quot;
&quot;Anyone to second this motion?&quot; 
The Secretary of the twelfth province looks around, but all we hear is the disparate answer of nature. 
My eyes scan the crowd for the excited, young voice, and I find Lyra standing there in the middle: squeamish, hoping for someone to extend her motion. And right beside her is Sylvia.
&quot;Please. Just humor me this once. Just hear me out,&quot; Lyra says. 
Raine nudges me, muttering something about his annoyance.
&quot;Will this close it, Lyra, once and for all?&quot; the Secretary asks.
&quot;Close the purpose we&apos;re out here? We have to . . .&quot; Her words trail off when she looks around at all the bowed heads. But she&apos;s still adamant.&quot;Yes. This time it&apos;s definitive.&quot;
&quot;Seconded, then,&quot; the Secretary says. &quot;Proceed with your new business.&quot;
The old Carmine leaders all appear sour and exhausted, as if it were just yesterday that they left their old lives. They turn away in ignorance, chattering with small talk to mute her out.
&quot;The time has finally arrived,&quot; she insists, and for such big words, they elicit no reaction, because I&apos;m sure they&apos;ve heard them before. &quot;I&apos;ve been stationed in Blackwater proper for several months with guising Chymaerans, and we witnessed something that has never happened before . . .&quot;
She milks suspense for every ounce she can get, but still comes up dry.
&quot;A column of crimson light broke the sky,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;That means two things. First, that there was Pure Essence in some form. And second, that someone of the Chosen bloodline got their hands on it!&quot;
&quot;That&apos;s impossible,&quot; the twelfth Chieftain says.
I hear two Carmine whisper behind us. 
&quot;Just because she&apos;s related to that bastard Ullrich doesn&apos;t make her special,&quot; one says. The other laughs until it turns to a cough.
Lyra continues, &quot;But that Pure Essence has fallen into the hands of the Afterlife.&quot;
The chieftain says, &quot;How, then? How do you know this when our messengers haven&apos;t even returned with this information?&quot;
&quot;Because we beat them here,&quot; Lyra says.
&quot;We can&apos;t act on something our messengers haven&apos;t confirmed,&quot; he replies.
I can see the frustration build inside Lyra. &quot;But I wasn&apos;t alone! There were two Chymaerans with me that witnessed it. And Sylvia. And Titus&mdash;&quot; she says, scanning the crowd for our faces, and she frowns when she finds me next to Raine.
Raine turns to me. &quot;Is this all really true?&quot;
&quot;Every word of it,&quot; I say.
With her argument crumbling to sand, Lyra fights to usher out her last argument before they silence her. &quot;And if that column of light erupted &mdash; and there was Pure Essence &mdash; then that means Fletcher is alive. It had to have been him!&quot;
Another audible groan from the audience.
&quot;No, think about it. Good Carmine brothers and sisters, there&apos;s no other possibility.&quot;
&quot;Impossible,&quot; I mutter: I lit that column of light. Telling them would only further confound the story and sully the waters. I&apos;m far too young to fit Lyra&apos;s theory, anyways.
&quot;I think we&apos;ve all heard quite enough of your . . . &apos;possibilities,&apos;&quot; Raine says. He stands beside me. &quot;Even if the Afterlife have a source of pure Essence, it&apos;s impossible that your brother is still alive.&quot;
Lyra turns to the Secretary who proposed the seconding motion in the first place. I can feel her anger towards their reverence because it begins to annoy me, too. I was almost excited when Lyra spoke so passionately about the First Red, and I was astounded when I saw their valiant efforts to survive beyond the walls.
&quot;We&apos;ve been over this so many times already, Lyra. Your brother is dead. So it doesn&apos;t matter,&quot; Raine says. &quot;Actually, you know what? Permission to debate this topic with the other party?&quot;
The Secretary polls. &quot;Call to vote. How many <em>aye</em>?&quot;
The amphitheater echoes with confirmation.
&quot;And <em>nay</em>?&quot;
Not a single voice responds.
&quot;The ayes have it,&quot; the Secretary says.
&quot;We&apos;re gonna end this discussion so we never have to have it again,&quot; he insists, and I can tell this scratches a wound that healed a long time ago. His anger isn&apos;t annoyance anymore. &quot;Your brother doesn&apos;t matter. And even if the Purebloods have Pure Essence in their possession, that doesn&apos;t matter either!&quot; Raine says. &quot;What we need more than anything is patience and diligence. We need to prepare ourselves.&quot;
&quot;We&apos;ve been prepared for years, Raine. When will it ever be enough? All of you out there have grown so complacent with your lives beyond the walls. You think the busywork you preoccupy yourself with, day in and day out, can even begin to atone for how afraid you are of the real reason you&apos;re here. You hide from it. You use the excuse of your sacrifice to ignore the reason you gave up that life in the first place.&quot;
&quot;There&apos;s a difference between giving up and having the patience to wait,&quot; Raine says. &quot;Every day I remember the ones I left behind. My late wife wept for months, grieving the children that died to her, and so many of us have faced the same, so don&apos;t tell us we&apos;ve forgotten our purpose! Unlike you, we don&apos;t have a reason to hate the life we left behind. And we anticipate, not fear, the day we get to return.&quot;
&quot;Then what perfect moment are you waiting for? And if you are waiting, how do you know it hasn&apos;t already passed?&quot; Lyra asks. &quot;We <em>are</em> ready. We have everything we could possibly need.&quot;
&quot;We&apos;re not ready, Lyra. And maybe you&apos;ve forgotten the strength of the power they have. One of their weakest civilians has the Essence of three of our strongest men!&quot;
&quot;But the Weakbloods are the ones that give them their true power,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Its not about the Essence. It&apos;s resources. And our connections tap into every single corner of Blackwater.&quot;
If only they knew what was really going on. They wouldn&apos;t believe the words from me, an outsider to all the Carmine, and it frustrates me the more I watch Lyra drown in her ambitions.
But their debate ends when a Carmine messenger flies down the stairs from the upper entrance: a gold-sealed letter in hand that shimmers in the light. 
The Secretary nearly jumps out of his chair. Lyra and Raine look on with newfound horror."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Craven Denial","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Thirteen","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Thirty-Two","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":13,"ChapterFull":32,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":100,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"97","Synopsis":"The First Red refuse the premise of their purpose.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.32","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

&quot;This matter will be tabled until next meeting,&quot; the Secretary says. His voice wavers, and for a man of such power to crumple, I know exactly what truth awaits. 
He wets his tongue before it dries like parchment. &quot;As you all know, the highest Carmine in Blackwater are given seals for correspondences beyond the walls. Red are for monthly reports: each division receives twelve. Silver are for important, urgent developments, and they&apos;re only allowed one per year. But gold . . . are only to be used once, for emergencies that threaten the life of everyone in Blackwater.&quot;
Lyra&apos;s expression is torn between reassurance and fear. Both her and Raine hang on to the messenger&apos;s next words.
&quot;District One. Six hours ago. &apos;Merlot siege on Carmine supply houses led to the deaths of several Brothers. Five supply houses have been burned. Massive ground war between Merlot and Carmine. Street riots in Merlot district have destroyed commercial and residential property.&apos; End of message.&quot;
My stomach drops as I wait for the news of Endogeny. Sylvia hangs on the edge of her seat.
The Secretary says, &quot;Only one district, Brothers and Sisters. We saw riots like these back in the 73rd year of Blackwater, no need for panic.&quot;
The message ends, but the messenger still isn&apos;t done. His hand draws into his pockets, pulling out a handful of envelopes.  The crowd gasps. He fans them out. My eyes can&apos;t count from such a far distance, but even more golden labels reflect under the sun as he raises the next.
&quot;District two. Twelve hours ago. &apos;Merlot attacked and burned five Carmine safe houses. Thirty-four dead or missing. Merlot claim they are not behind the attacks. Massive infighting on streets. Carmine and Carmine-allied civilians actively destroying Merlot property, regardless of orders to stop.&apos; End of message.&quot;
He pulls another.
&quot;District Four. Seven hours ago. &apos;Sixteen dead in assault on . . . &apos;&quot;
The messages continue for fifteen more minutes, and the anxiety only crescendoes over that time. It&apos;s after the ninth district&apos;s gold-sealed memo that the Secretary finally calls everything to order.
&quot;Enough! We will discuss these in private with the Executive Board,&quot; the Secretary says.
Lyra sees her chance to further her point. &quot;You see? It&apos;s time,&quot; she says, &quot;and together, we&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Take your seats, everyone! Do not leave. Do not tell anyone beyond this meeting of the news. It will only stir panic when we haven&apos;t made a decision on our response,&quot; the Secretary says. 
Lyra&apos;s hand suspends in the air with the Amulet, but no one watches her. &quot;Decision? This is the moment we&apos;ve been waiting for!&quot;
&quot;Now&apos;s not the time,&quot; Raine tells her.
&quot;We will call a vote, right now,&quot; the Secretary says.
There&apos;s no way they can deny it with how this trouble has brewed. The evidence is indisputable.
&quot;Vote is now called: should the First Red return to Blackwater?&quot; asks the Secretary.
&quot;Point of information,&quot; Lyra says.
&quot;Proceed,&quot; the Secretary says.
&quot;Our people need us. They&apos;ve been waiting for our return, and this is the moment that will make or break the Carmine.&quot;
Raine says, &quot;That doesn&apos;t directly mean it&apos;s time for us to go. There have been great clashes before, but that doesn&apos;t mean the Purebloods are any weaker: in fact, it means they&apos;re stronger, now that our brothers and sisters toil with the Merlot!&quot;
&quot;But they weren&apos;t the Merlot,&quot; Lyra insists.
&quot;And how would you know that?&quot;
&quot;Because the Afterlife was disguised as the Merlot when they attacked us both times,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;They were sewing the seeds of discord between the Merlot and the Carmine for their own gain!&quot;
&quot;The Afterlife,&quot; Raine says. &quot;If we&apos;re fighting them, then we need more time to build our strength and plan our tactics.&quot;
&quot;Screw tactics: we&apos;ve been strategizing for years. There is no perfect time. That&apos;s just an excuse to bury our heads in the snow and still keep our honor!&quot;
The Secretary interrupts them. &quot;We will put this matter to another vote.&quot;
&quot;Alright, then. Do what&apos;s right. Remember what we&apos;re here for,&quot; Lyra demands, &quot;we have to put actions to the purpose that gives us pride.&quot;
A silence awaits the vote.
&quot;This congregation will now cast the vote of return to Blackwater. A &apos;aye&apos; vote sets in motion the return protocol. A &apos;nay&apos; vote withholds our return.&quot;
I look around. All their faces are set in anxious horror &mdash; the same cowardice I saw in Romin&apos;s cadets at the foothills of the afterlife.
&quot;How many votes &apos;aye?&apos;&quot;
&quot;Aye!&quot; I stand. There are few young Brothers and Sisters in the audience who join me. A couple others quietly mutter from the audience, but still remain seated in the grass. Raine is silent, and with him, the rest bow their heads.
As they count the votes, I turn around, only to find that Sylvia cowers with them. Lyra stands there with her hand stretched in the air, trying to coerce her, but even in a losing fight, she still refuses.
Raine and the Secretary almost look relieved. &quot;Alright. And how many votes &apos;nay?&apos;&quot;
The response starts quiet, but grows louder as more voices join: their weakness in numbers, and I see Lyra&apos;s disappointed anger crescendo.
&quot;Vote has been called. The &apos;nays&apos; have&mdash;&quot;
&quot;You spineless cowards, have you lost your edge? Your own people are dying and all you do is watch!&quot; Lyra says.
Raine turns around, relieved. &quot;Calm down, Lyra. A fair vote was taken.&quot;
&quot;Do the Carmine of Blackwater who are dying under the thumb of the Purebloods get a vote? Or is it only the purposeless pricks beyond the wall that get to decide?&quot;
&quot;We&apos;ve heard enough, Lyra!&quot; says the Secretary.
&quot;Chymaeran surveillance in all twelve districts. First Red Carmine, ready in a matter of hours, to press towards whatever target we set. And so many Carmine districts waiting, just waiting, for the prophecy of the First Red to come to them, to tell them it&apos;s time for the final fight.&quot;
&quot;Get her out of here, someone,&quot; the Secretary demands, and several eagerly jump to his aid.
&quot;They have all the protocols we&apos;ve written, and all we need to do is send a single letter. I&apos;m tired of waiting, thinking any of you are going to change when you&apos;re just cowards, obsessed with a dream of purpose you&apos;ll never &mdash; get your hands off me!&quot;
Raine can sense I&apos;m dissatisfied: I stood right beside him, after all. &quot;Why didn&apos;t it pass?&quot; I ask. &quot;This is the time all of you have been waiting for, isn&apos;t it?&quot;
He draws a tender look before answering, like a father lecturing his misguided son. &quot;I&apos;m sure you know this by now, but there are very few young Brothers and Sisters beyond the walls. Most of them look to Lyra as the image that represents them. But they&apos;re too young to understand what it means to have something to lose,&quot; he explains.
&quot;But isn&apos;t sacrifice the very premise of what you&apos;ve sworn to protect?&quot;
&quot;Sacrifice can only be useful if it&apos;s used wisely, Titus,&quot; he says, but his explanation only disappoints and frustrates me further.
If only they could be reminded of the people they left. The sentimental value of their lives when it&apos;s not degraded to a distant anecdote.
&quot;Where&apos;s the other girl you came here with?&quot; He says, just as bad at remembering girls&apos; names as his son. &quot;Now that the two of you are together, we can finish your orientation.&quot;
We&apos;re not quite on speaking terms after our last fight, but I scan for her anyways. I wave to her and she approaches.
&quot;What do you want?&quot; She asks.
&quot;We need to finish orientation,&quot; I say.
&quot;Of course,&quot; she tells me. Then she turns to Raine. &quot;I&apos;m glad that vote didn&apos;t pass.&quot;
&quot;Same,&quot; Raine tells her. &quot;And in time, I know your friend here will come to appreciate what we&apos;ve built, and how he can contribute.&quot;
She tries to meet my eyes to confirm Raine&apos;s rationale, to say she&apos;s right and I&apos;m wrong. If only any of them could understand what they&apos;ve abandoned; how much they&apos;ll regret their dithering when they see everyone is dead. But this is their world, and it will never be mine.
&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Raine says. I realize he&apos;s already transferring Essence, the same way he did with me. &quot;It&apos;s an amazing feeling. But don&apos;t let it scare you, Sylvia, or can be a lot the first time.&quot;
She closes her eyes, trying to release the tension she draws to resist the pain.
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; she says.
I watch the blood jointly pool between their palms. That same electric sensation rises inside of her like tinnitus of the flesh. Raine twists his palm, and in an instant, Sylvia grasps her head with her other hand.
&quot;Gods &mdash; what is that? It hurts!&quot; She says.
&quot;Hurts? It&apos;s not supposed to hurt,&quot; Raine says. &quot;It feels like being under a massive waterfall, like heavy gravity pointing inside you instead of down.&quot;
Sylvia releases his hand, and I can see the inklings of a sight I could never forget. It takes only the slightest Essence to instigate that side of her.
&quot;Is she alright?&quot; Raine asks me. &quot;I hardly transferred anything. I didn&apos;t even really start.&quot;
Sylvia mutters something indiscernible.
&quot;Huh?&quot; I bend closer to her.
&quot;Fridging cowards,&quot; she says. 
Raine still bends back: it&apos;s inaudible to his old ears.
&quot;They are,&quot; I mutter.
&quot;Two-hundred ninety-three times around since last time,&quot; she says. &quot;You&apos;re lucky I can only peer through a sliver of this earthly form. Will I have to destroy this timeline, too?&quot;
My heart short-circuits on a skip, and when I muster a breath, it feels like it won&apos;t start again."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":67,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":13,"ChapterFull":32,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":67,"Index":102,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"Written","Keywords":"","UUID":"99","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Sylvia recounts vision.

I can feel the Essence try to surge inside her, but I&apos;m fortunate it&apos;s not enough. I&apos;m the only one who notices the faintest glow in her, because I&apos;ve seen this all before.
&quot;Why do you torment me?&quot; I ask.
Sylvia grasps her head. &quot;Wh-what are you talking about? The argument? I&apos;m sorry&mdash;&quot; she groans.
But I&apos;m too focused on that panic that twists my stomach. If the air weren&apos;t so fresh, if it were sullied with the slightest smoke, I might vomit, but I manage to hold it back, clutching my chest.
&quot;What happened to the two of you? What did you tell him, Sylvia?&quot;
&quot;Nothing,&quot; I tell him. &quot;I was just really afraid for her, that&apos;s all.&quot;
&quot;Well we don&apos;t have to do this now,&quot; Raine says. &quot;It&apos;s been a long day for the two of you. I&apos;d grind every ounce of effort out of you if this were another day. But today I&apos;m in a good mood.&quot;
<em>Of course you are</em>, I think. <em>Your outwaller vacation</em>&apos;<em>s been extended even longer!</em>
Raine says, &quot;Report back to the Barracks and get some sleep. We&apos;ll try all this again tomorrow.&quot;
I lift Sylvia to her feet as Raine joins the exodus of the First Red. The pain is still deep behind her eyes.
&quot;Did it happen to you, too?&quot;
&quot;What?&quot; I ask her.
&quot;When you got the Essence transferred to you. That visceral flash of something &mdash; not quite a dream &mdash; so convincingly real. It was horrifying,&quot; she says.
&quot;What did you see?&quot;
&quot;It was a dream. I was so big, and you were so small, and I . . . I couldn&apos;t resist the force behind the voice, that voice I&apos;ve heard for years, that whisper . . . all I felt was the longing to protect you. You were so sad, tired, and scared, but I wasn&apos;t in control, I was a passenger, just like watching one of Val&apos;s pictures, and for the first time, that voice took control of more than just my thoughts.&quot;
&quot;You remember that?&quot; I ask her.
&quot;Remember what? It was just feelings, flashes of light and sound,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;A dream.&quot;
&quot;But that voice. Why can&apos;t you beat it or make it go away?&quot; I ask her.
&quot;Because it&apos;s resilient to anything I try,&quot; she says.
&quot;It&apos;s not just a voice. It&apos;s you. It was all real! Don&apos;t you want to know where we came from?&quot;
&quot;What are you implying, Titus?&quot; She asks. &quot;What are my dreams to you?&quot;
&quot;What you saw was a past reality I witnessed. You&mdash;&quot;
The panic returns to me when I try to remember, my lungs coughing smoke, the entirety of Blackwater wiped from existence.
&quot;What did I do?&quot;
&quot;You &mdash; lost control.&quot;
&quot;Of what?&quot;
&quot;Of that power inside you,&quot; I tell her. &quot;It&apos;s divine blood. You have that . . . side, of yourself, locked away,&quot; I say.
&quot;I don&apos;t believe it,&quot; she says, and she&apos;s getting visibly upset. &quot;I don&apos;t believe any of that!&quot;
&quot;Why can&apos;t you try? We can try it again, right now. I have just enough Essence. Believe me,&quot; I say, withdrawing my pocket knife, but she shirks back.
&quot;No. No,&quot; she says, &quot;I&apos;m not going through that again.&quot;
&quot;Why are you so afraid of it?&quot; I ask. &quot;Why can&apos;t you try?&quot;
&quot;Because next time I might lose myself entirely. Let&apos;s live here instead, the two of us!&quot;
I tension my left fist as my right fist closes the pocketknife, drawing it into my pocket. &quot;All of you here, I swear to the Gods. You&apos;re all just cowards.&quot;
&quot;What did you just say?&quot; She says.
&quot;You all just dream of a better future, thinking one day it will all be different, as if all your thoughts together could will it into existence,&quot; I say. &quot;But if doesn&apos;t work like that. And Lyra&apos;s Gods-damn right: if someone doesn&apos;t wake you up now, you&apos;ll regret all of it when it&apos;s too late!&quot;
I realize we&apos;ve been walking towards the barracks for the last five minutes, so focused on the conversation I forgot to take in my surroundings, the loudness of my voice.
&quot;If all that you talked about is real,&quot; Sylvia starts. &quot;If you are killed, or kill yourself, and manage to go all the way back, then what happens to the me right now, right here?&quot;
I pause to think. It&apos;s hard to imagine my value through other people&apos;s eyes when I&apos;m just a resource.
&quot;What will happen to me when I find your body? Can you live with that, knowing all that grief you&apos;d cause me, and all your friends?&quot;
She waits for my answer, but I don&apos;t have one for her.
&quot;How many people have you left behind to grieve?&quot; she asks.
&quot;All the times before, there hasn&apos;t been a single person to remember me,&quot; I tell her. &quot;But it doesn&apos;t matter. They can get over me. I&apos;m just another guy whose name the world will speak one day for the last time, just like everyone else.&quot; 
I duck my head as I look at my arms: how many scars have formed on my wrist. Yet I know each one of those lives, if they persist, are doomed to the very purging that Sylvia&apos;s other half condemned them to.
&quot;It&apos;s selfish, the way you don&apos;t value yourself,&quot; she says. &quot;And if I can&apos;t convince you of all the grief you can unwittingly cause, then all I can hope is that one day, in some reality, you can love yourself the way your friends and family truly cherish you. One day, you will realize that can be enough.&quot;
&quot;I still have a vision,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Maybe that day will come. But I&apos;ll never give up, I&apos;ll never be done until you, and everyone, have everything you deserve.&quot;
A breadth of silence later, we stand atop the porch, and as soon as the rusted hinges of the barracks&apos; back door screech, our argument ends at an impasse. She&apos;ll always continue being afraid, and I&apos;ll always continue fighting to save her. 
That night, I wait until Sylvia falls asleep in our tightly-packed dormitory. I sweat from the heat, restless with our window open as I stare at an unfamiliar ceiling in my cot. That anger is still inside me. The anxiety of time dragging me further and further away from that branching point sets me on eternal edge.
I&apos;m too scared to shut my eyes and dream of their final lamentations. I&apos;ve seen them enough times to remember every detail of how they died. And somewhere, up the streams of these branches spreading outwards, the real version of all these people wait.
Two hours pass before the woman sleeping next to me is a stranger. There are no brakes on this train that heads for a gorge; an unavoidable, zero-sum, ill-fated end. I don&apos;t have to ask forgiveness from anyone that won&apos;t be around to remember, so I leave my guilt and soul at the window, along with the sleeping girl.

&quot;She never came home, so please, just tell me, I haven&apos;t heard from her in days,&quot; she says. Her fists clench the lapel of my jacket, but I sag in the corner, folded over myself.
Then he cuts in. 
&quot;She says you saw her last. She was headed to your house. The whole reason we got into this mess is because you made her disappear!&quot;
His fist slams the metal siding harder than all the other desperate Cadets. But my eyes don&apos;t reach them. I stare at the worn rubber soles of my boots, wondering how many steps can be unwritten, and for that matter, if they still can.
I wonder if I have the strength to pull all the way through. Or else I&apos;m no better than the ones I allowed to die.
&quot;Calm down, Jarrett. We don&apos;t know that,&quot; Delvin insists. &quot;How do we know she even made it there? She&apos;s Merlot royalty, and you&apos;re Carmine yourself. They were furious. You know, any one of them could have&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Could have what?&quot; Vera says. &quot;What?&quot;
&quot;&mdash;I-I don&apos;t know, Vera, I&apos;m just saying,&quot; he says. 
I can feel her fists tension tighter on my coat, but beneath all the anxious fury I can feel her tremble. I think I hear sobs leave her throat, but there are many that cry from helplessness in this narrow space.
&quot;What about Sylvia? What happened to her?&quot; Delvin asks. &quot;And the other Carmine guy. Rohan.&quot;
&quot;Romin,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;Damn it, Titus, just say something! Why did they throw you on here? Where in Khiras&apos; name were you hiding to be this far out? And why did they stop the train so suddenly?&quot;
&quot;They&apos;re all waiting for us,&quot; I say. It&apos;s the first thing I&apos;ve said since then.
&quot;Where? Are they beyond the walls, too?&quot;
&quot;They&apos;re all waiting,&quot; I insist, and if I squint my mind&apos;s eye I can still see them.
&quot;What is he on about?&quot; asks Isla, too short to look over them, clenching Jarrett&apos;s mark, so easily tossed about the moving car.
&quot;He says they&apos;re still alive,&quot; says Vera, and her grip loosens, though she still trembles. &quot;But where is my sister?&quot;
&quot;Lyra. Raine. My father. And my sister, too,&quot; I continue. &quot;They&apos;re all waiting, and I can bring you to them.&quot;
&quot;Is she in the other car? With the rest of your Fireteam, surely, right? Sylvia and Romin?&quot; Vera&apos;s voice cracks on the last syllable as she turns to them. &quot;She has to be! I can&apos;t leave things the way we left them . . .&quot;
&quot;You&apos;re gonna see her again. You&apos;re all going to see them,&quot; I say.
Something bashes on the siding, rapping over and over like Carmine rallying drums. It startles everyone in the car, and for the first time, I can make out the faces of all the strangers in this dimly-lit space.
It&apos;s the door sliding open on its track. And over the cries and shrieks of panic-stricken prisoners, nobody noticed the train reached the end of the line.
&quot;We can rush them,&quot; Jarrett says: words I&apos;ve heard before, words that can only bring the same result of thoughtless bloodshed. &quot;Listen. We&apos;re third-class Cadets, and you have our strength. They can&apos;t stop all of us!&quot;
His optimism infuriates me. I envy that tactless, stupid hope they find when they&apos;re all going to die no matter what. But I don&apos;t have to speak on it. Like the First Red, they&apos;re all cowards with only enough headspace to consider themselves.
&quot;Listen! We can&mdash;&quot;
A voice feathers from static. &quot;And where are you going to go, you stupid Carmine sap?&quot; 
It&apos;s a Chymaeran, guised in bright fabrics of the Afterlife.
&quot;We&apos;re getting out of here,&quot;Jarrett insists.
&quot;All talk and no brains. No wonder the First Red were all blown out of their foxholes,&quot; the Chymaeran says, though Jarrett doesn&apos;t even know what the First Red are. &quot;You&apos;ll all turn to Frosthards in the first ten seconds. We&apos;ll reap your Essence anyway!&quot;
&quot;Reap our Essence?&quot; Vera asks.
&quot;Fuel,&quot; I mutter to myself. That keyword makes sense now.
The Cadets are petrified: unsure of whether they wish to let the floor swallow them or try to run with Jarrett. Either is suicide.
&quot;This isn&apos;t just a prison. You are not being punished for anything. You are only fulfilling your purpose, and I&apos;m giving you an opportunity,&quot; he says, and down the line of cars, I hear other guards give the same spiel to their unwitting participants. &quot;In the scale of this world&apos;s future, your purpose is vital: each and every one of you. You afford this world another chance at the Golden Age that was torn from us. And so you will be given a chance to choose your fate.&quot; 
He sneers on a line of empty promise, one he&apos;s surely rehearsed so many times before.
 &quot;And the highest achievers will become one of the chosen ones of the Afterlife!&quot;
&quot;You drag us here without an option, and now you want to talk to us about choices?&quot; A cadet says.
&quot;All you have to tell me is if you are strong or weak,&quot; he says. Darkness spreads across his skin and clothes, morphing him from a Human puritan to a thick-shelled Chymaeran.
I forgot what it felt like to see a Chymaeran for the first time. Some cadets jump with fright, while most are so emotionally raw they stare with unblinking desperation. 
The Chymaeran asks the most frightened one in front of them first.
&quot;What are you?&quot; The Chymaeran asks her.
 &quot;I . . .&quot; She looks around at the others, unsure of how to answer, and yelps when the choice doesn&apos;t come to her. &quot;I, er . . . I am . . .&quot;
&quot;Answer! All your fellow Cadets will freeze if we don&apos;t get through you.&quot;
&quot;Weak,&quot; she answers. &quot;I am weak.&quot;
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; he says. He motions for them to pass him, and they get off just fine. Several gasp in disbelief. They thought it would be much worse.
&quot;And you?&quot;
The next one is another woman, younger with red hair and freckles. She looks past the Chymaeran at the other woman and her kids. Some look of reassurance crosses her face after a few seconds. She looks down at her meager Garnet-level mark before answering. &quot;I am weak,&quot; she replies, bashful.
&quot;Then go,&quot; says the Chymaeran.
Another Cadet steps up, a young man this time. Some guy I met once in passing, enough a sense of pride that shines far beyond his actual level.
&quot;I think I am . . . strong,&quot; he says.
The Chymaeran sneers again.  &quot;You think?&quot;
&quot;I am,&quot; he insists.
&quot;Then step aside.&quot; He tries to exit, misunderstanding them. &quot;No! Aside the cabin. Right here,&quot; he says, motioning to the front wall before turning to the next one. &quot;And you? What are you?&quot;
I can tell it&apos;s his fireteammate from the way they look at each other. Did they let these people group themselves onto the trains intentionally? Before they knew where they were headed?
The confident guy nods. His friend speaks up.
&quot;I&apos;m strong, too.&quot;
&quot;Then face each other,&quot; the Chymaeran says, throwing something on the ground to each of them. &quot;Pick it up. Now!&quot;
And they do. I watch the terror settle in their eyes when they regret speaking those words.
&quot;Then prove it.&quot; He says. &quot;You have one minute to decide who&apos;s the <em>real</em> Champion.&quot;
&quot;You mean&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Now.&quot;
The courageous one pleads. &quot;Victor,&quot; he says, as his voice trembles. How quickly he folds on himself, and his friend does, too, once they realize there&apos;s no way out. They circle each other, idling time. 
&quot;I can&apos;t do this. I can&apos;t! I&apos;ve known you since Seminary,&quot; the first says.
&quot;We have to, Gage, come on! Come at me,&quot; Victor lunges with a hollow slash that couldn&apos;t cut a dandelion.
&quot;No, no, no,&quot; Gage says, his eyes shifting between the impatient Chymaeran and his friend. Victor takes a further slice as Gage idles, flaying the skin of his arm, but he hesitates as soon as he realizes what he&apos;s done.
Gage screams with pain. He looks down at the slice as he drops his knife, and Victor panics, holding his hands to his ears and sobbing while the knife is still on his hands.
Victor says, &quot;I hardly even cut you! I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m sorry, please,&quot; he repeats, over and over, &quot;I didn&apos;t mean to,&quot; before the knife slips from his fingers, stabbing into the wooden slats.
I recognize it in an instant. Gage shudders on the ground, and it&apos;s tough to make out in the shadows, but the faintest amethyst glow encapsulates his entire body.
&quot;We learned it took too long to make you skin each other alive,&quot; the Chymaeran explains. Moments later, Gage&apos;s breathing stops when he melts into the floor. The hard parts of him become amorphous. And then, when the Amethyst absorbs him completely, leaving nothing but the Garnet-class cloak, the spectators gasp when a small trail of Essence gusts from Gage into Victor.
&quot;This is how this world really works, shitbloods,&quot; the Chymaeran says. &quot;Victor here learned something today. And I hope you all can learn through him, too!&quot;
Victor still trembles. But all of a sudden he tenses, clutching his chest. In the darkness, the Chymaeran&apos;s slender arm reaches behind him, and in moments, the same Amethyst leaks like living ink down his limbs from beneath his cloak.
Gage&apos;s knife clatters to the ground.
&quot;You&apos;ll learn that we don&apos;t tolerate hesitation,&quot; the Chymaeran says, &quot;if you consider yourself a Champion, if you think you can equate yourselves with us.&quot; The crowd stirs in panic. They were raised as slaves, and now they&apos;ll die as them in whatever fate awaits the reluctant. 
I startle Vera when I rise to my feet. &quot;And how free will these winners be?&quot; I ask.
&quot;You will join the Afterlife in its mission. This is the way we&apos;ve recruited the few remaining spaces every time, every passing class. Haven&apos;t you wondered what happened to all those lower-ranked losers that died in &apos;service&apos; beyond the walls?&quot;
&quot;But why do we deserve this?&quot; Another asks.
&quot;Because this is what you signed up for!&quot; the Chymaeran says. &quot;You got a meal plan, lodging, your families taken care of with a stipend for your training. You knew this risk would come the day you signed on to the Academy. You knew the class-system and you chose to play the game, and now that the trade-off for all you&apos;ve leeched from us is here, you will fulfill your true value!&quot;
He eyes the back of the car where Isla, Jarrett, and Delvin huddle together, noting their marks.
&quot;Dragon-class cadets? Why are you here?&quot;
&quot;They said it was desertion,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;We didn&apos;t go to the upper lands to defend against the &apos;Carmine,&apos; because we were looking for someone.&quot;
&quot;How unfortunate,&quot; the Chymaeran says. &quot;You see, now, lowly Cadets, these Dragon-Class fighters have <em>real</em> strength, and they&apos;ve proven enough to join the strong.&quot; He motions for them to approach, and when they do, Isla drags my shirt for me to follow.
But he stops me.
&quot;And where do you think you&apos;re going, vagrant? How did you even get mixed in here?&quot; He laughs. &quot;How unfortunate.&quot;
Isla tries to defend me. &quot;Titus was the Valedictorian of our class. He&apos;s at the same level. He&apos;s the best of all of us! Go on, tell him,&quot; Isla tells me.
I look down at the outwaller fabrics that cover my body: shoddy yet dense and warm, or they would be, if there weren&apos;t so many holes torn in them.
&quot;Damn it, say something!&quot;
&quot;Are you strong or weak?&quot; the Chymaeran asks.
&quot;He&apos;s strong,&quot; Isla says.
&quot;I was asking <em>him,</em> shitblood.&quot;
I feel my hands tension. I&apos;m unsure whether I have the strength to do it myself this time, but I&apos;ve run out of allies to expend and paths to take.
&quot;I am strong,&quot; I say.
&quot;Then prove yourself, vagrant,&quot; he replies.

The pencil-necked Garnet-class cadet across from me shakes like the rest of them, never having witnessed real violence in his life. I don&apos;t approach him, yet he backs himself into a corner. The car full of prisoners parts like a bad haircut to let him by.
&quot;We don&apos;t have to do this, you know,&quot; he says, steadying the knife as his hand trembles. As I approach closer, his eyes widen and he shields himself, thinking of me as some psychotic vagrant from the city fringe. &quot;I&apos;m trained in combat, unlike you, vagrant. I&apos;ll cut you open!&quot;
&quot;Then try me,&quot; I say. My hands are perfectly steady. The same mantra of Sylvia and Lyra&apos;s last words they spoke to me cycles through my mind. Bedrock is the most solid state of all.
He lunges for a warning slice, so off-balanced that it almost carries him into the onlookers. I still stand there, passively, my body unhinged towards any defensive position.
He speaks words just to get a rise out of the Chymaeran, to idle and show his toughness, but the fear of that moral edge is something he can&apos;t ever hope to hide. I can tell, because despite everything, I still hang on the same edge. Rank means nothing when the weight of our souls is the same. Or so I tell myself. But the only way back is to cross an unforgivable line I still haven&apos;t crossed.
I begin walking towards him, and even though I&apos;m average height, my build is intimidating enough to drive him back. He mutters something indiscernible. The Chymaeran grows impatient. And as the last moment of action passes by, I wonder if I&apos;ll be stuck in this moment forever, just like last time.
But then his heel catches on the leg of one of the prisoners. He trips. The serrated edge fumbles through his hands, almost at a half-turn before he reaches for it again.
I duck out of the way just in time to miss it again, twisting my body left as it passes me, forgetting about the knife I&apos;m still clutching in a death grip. I feel a resistance, then hear a futile gasp, when I finally collect myself enough to step back.
When I look back at the scrawny cadet, the slice parts his jaw like a cleft chin. Just the smallest paper-cut is enough for those with no Essence, and I turn away before I can watch it cycle through him.
As I feel all of his meager Essence enter my circuits, I hear her words as they cross my mind. <em>You will never be better. You will never deserve that perfect world with all the ones you</em>&apos;<em>ve left behind!</em>
The Chymaeran takes my refusal to watch as a sign of resilience. &quot;You have a chance, vagrant,&quot; he says, stepping aside the door. Vera and her fireteam look on with disbelief: my back was to all of them when it happened, and for all they know, I murdered the Garnet-class weakling in cold blood, unaffected.
Past the steaming train cars wet with melted frost that drips from their bowed roofs, two lines form beyond each train car&apos;s door, separated by a tall fence. One of them is short and straight. The other bends and serpentines on itself, taking at least twenty times the space of the other. 
I peer to my right and left. The lines are short, but both extents of the train stretch so far in an arc of repetition that they disappear into the snowstorm.
All I can see is a single building in the center, looking far too small to contain all of us: and the survivors, strong or weak, filing into it.
The few cars already emptied are being loaded with something I can&apos;t discern in the blinding white, but there&apos;s so much of it. It&apos;s the only thing that exits this place besides the elderly guards: in barrels and boxes aged for so long it almost looks like they&apos;re made of petrified wood.
The line of cowards fills with so many that they run out of space to file, but in my line only two more join. They&apos;re shaken with disbelief, refusing to believe what it took them to join us.
&quot;One at a time. Six feet apart. Don&apos;t stop,&quot; one guard says on repeat, ushering the weak with a baton.
&quot;So you are the fighters,&quot; another Afterlife guard says. &quot;Do you feel this, right now? Or have you gotten too used to it? Enjoy the snow, the cold, the fresh air. Remember every feeling of it. Because it will be the last memory you&apos;ll live on for as long as you make it.&quot;
They call our car number. It numbers somewhere in the hundreds.
&quot;Around fourteen times a year, I get to witness this,&quot; he says, to our small group of seven. &quot;Fourteen provinces graduating, their times equally spaced, arriving on seven or eight full loads of trains &mdash; but for me, it&apos;s so much longer.&quot;
He motions for us to follow, and the closer I draw to the round-domed stone edifice, the more I feel the energy of this place vibrate in my circuits. I can&apos;t explain how I sense its direction, but something immensely powerful feels as if it will set me into seizure, twisting my stomach as we pass beneath the frame. I seem to be the only one it affects, because I&apos;m the only one that&apos;s been afforded this much Essence.
The entrance hallway is pitch dark: only twenty meters or so long, but it feels like I&apos;ve been walking in-place for minutes. It feels as if the front and back of my body are trying to meet each other in the center, constrained in a straight line by some flux that feels as if it compresses me.
The air becomes so dense that it makes us light-headed. Every time I step forward, my legs feel like they hinge slower than the hour hands of a clock, but when my feet fall behind to draw the next step, they accelerate with such speed I think I&apos;ll trip. Every sensation brought from ether behind or in front of me renders my mind as a useless gage, feeling sensations that aren&apos;t there, as if I&apos;m being crunched and stretched and slowed and sped all at the same time, only stabilized by the head of Jarrett struggling in front of me.
The only sensation I trust next is when I know it&apos;s ended, when we arrive in the great central chamber spanning at least a hundred yards in diameter. I turn around to peer through that strange hallway I just entered, and on the other end, a new band of cadets stands nearly still. Beyond them, white snowflakes rest still in the air like stars in a photo-negative sky.
Some cadets retch from the nausea. Some vomit. Others gaze in awe at the scale of the chamber. Above us, true sunlight pours through a glassless dome where the snowflakes stick to nothing, refusing to cross the threshold of its geometry. The circular walk rims around a vacant gap in the center where turbulent winds flow upwards, and above us in the very center of the dome are concentric spinning wheels.
Something thuds directly behind me from above. On the ground I find a mess of feathers, and a bird that looks as if it&apos;s been half-consumed. The left-wing is still flushed with healthy feathers, but I can tell it snapped its neck running into something. Bisecting it is a thin line of advancing decay, and all that&apos;s left of it on the other side is just bone.
&quot;You took that transition over the course of a couple minutes,&quot; our Afterlife chaperon says. &quot;That&apos;s why you could take it. Up there, across that dome &mdash; the whole transition takes place across a breadth no wider than a finger.&quot;
I look behind me. The next cadets approach no faster, still as statues in the corridor.
&quot;Then how did it snap its neck? There&apos;s nothing up there.&quot;
&quot;It went from a speed <em>out there</em> to the speed <em>in here,</em> he says. I look closer at the head, flattened like the top of a mushroom, as if the impact happened inside itself. &quot;From a second per second to roughly seven seconds per second. That&apos;s all it took.&quot;
We all find ourselves looking up towards the great mechanical wheels at the center of the dome: six concentric ones, the smallest one spinning so fast its just a blur. Each, in turn, spins slower and slower, until the outermost ring rotates about once a minute.
&quot;Let this be a lesson as to why you don&apos;t jump down the pit, there,&quot; he says. &quot;Only transition slowly. Or else the effects of dilation will flatten you, and you&apos;ll crush inwards on yourself. You&apos;re much better as a resource.&quot;
The nauseous cadets collect themselves and wipe their mouths, and after they regain their footing, the Chymaeran takes us to a room filled with white-and-red garments.
&quot;I want each of you to take three sets of clothing. It will be all you&apos;ll have,&quot; he says, and so we filter through stacks of the garments. Most of them are tattered and aged, splotched with long-dried blood in some places, so old that the smell died with it. Others disintegrate to dust when I touch them. I pull three from the stack that look remotely clean and rejoin the group as he goads us down towards the bottom.
Jarrett pulls his fireteam aside and mutters to them, motioning for me to come over. &quot;We can all make it out of here. I don&apos;t know where they&apos;re taking us, but there will be blood. And we know we&apos;re the strongest group out of all of them.&quot;
&quot;But what happens when we have to face each other?&quot; Delvin asks. &quot;You know where this is going! Any other luck and I would have had to face one of you,&quot; he says.
&quot;But we&apos;re too valuable to them, and they know it,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;They won&apos;t waste us because we&apos;re limited.&quot;
We change into our new clothes, indifferentiable from each other. Somewhere across the way, the vast majority of the cadets that came here wear black: even with the darkness of the fabric, I can tell there is no blood splotched on them. Their task is something different, though ours is certain.
All our possessions are removed next. The only thing that matters to me is people, and all the ones I care about have been torn from me, so I don&apos;t put up a fight like Vera, who insists on keeping some gift from her sister.
&quot;You won&apos;t be needing it,&quot; an Afterlife guard says.
I relinquish my obsidian necklace. It will be of no use to me anymore. The bright memory it carries is branded inside me, along with all the faces, along with the mission whose insidious demands I&apos;ll force myself to meet. All that we&apos;re left with is the most elementary commodities to scrape our last days or months of survival &mdash; before we&apos;re fed to the great machine of the Afterlife, churning hapless youth into the Essence they need to build a false throne of the Gods.
Somewhere beyond this place, the snow hangs stagnant in the air. The Backwoods of the First Red returns to eternal winter, the thousand dead reduced to Frosthards. Even further out there, Endogeny eviscerates the innocent civilians.  A lift erupts in flames on the mountainside from Carmine intervention, not crushing the bastard daughter beneath because she was murdered too early. And above, the Afterlife celebrate the dawn of a new age, ignorant to the weight of all their actions, so focused on the light of a new Golden Age they&apos;ll destroy anything that obstructs them."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Timeless","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Two","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Thirty-Four","ActNum":4,"ChapterPart":2,"ChapterFull":34,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":107,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"103","Synopsis":"Titus finds himself deep within the Undercroft.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"4.34","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

This place wasn&apos;t erected as a prison two-hundred years ago. All the ancient farming tools tell a different story of why it came to exist: purposed as a tool for infinite, bountiful harvests beyond comprehension, feeding the masses of this frozen landscape for generations. Each level is unfathomably tall and wide, spanning so high it&apos;s impossible to tell the ceiling, each floor latticed with an intricate maze of patterned walls and rooms that act as structural supports for the great openings of grass fields.
There are three great columns of light stretching from freedom to the bottomless depths below: the dome we saw was only the tip of one of them. We&apos;ve counted fifty-three sleeps in lieu of days, and looking up from the second level to the sky above, it took twenty-five of them before the sun crossed the sky.
I hardly talk to Vera&apos;s fireteam. I only talk when I have to. They spend most of their time reminiscing between tending the fields and busy work. I spent a week of free time watching a single bird cross the span of the dome &mdash; the only fortunate feature of this dungeon being the boundless harvests of produce from the lower floors.
We all know we&apos;re being fattened up for the harvest. The food we produce is sent back on the trains to the main city as feed for the rest of the civilians, so much that it&apos;s almost impossible to store. On the level above, it&apos;d be a year before another train of cadets arrived. Down here, Isla told us it would be another thirteen YEARS &mdash; just enough time for the tens of thousands of cadets to be processed here for the next batch. She uncovered the nature of this dungeon in a couple days from just water droplets. She ran the math in her head of how long it took them to fall, with some geometric math of how high the ceiling is. 
The time of the floors below are unknown to us. At least for Isla&apos;s experiment, the raindrops accelerate and flatten so quickly that it&apos;s impossible to tell. Isla says that at a constant rate, the ones below us would live ten days for every one of ours, and if there&apos;s anything below that, roughly one-hundred-and-thirty days per day for them.
All we know is that cadets keep disappearing. All I can manage to guess is that nearly ten thousand are on this floor, but every week we&apos;ve been here, it&apos;s been enough to notice, and it always happens at the same time.
If you stand near the exact center of the three empty columns and hold your breath, hoping the silence is enough to coax out the faintest sound, some cadets swear you hear clashing metal somewhere high above, so slow and faded like a bow drawn against strings. But the mysteries of this place don&apos;t matter me. I&apos;ve been trying to steel myself for something I know is coming. I don&apos;t want to make better friends with any of them or else it will be harder. And after the endless stretches of exhausting labor, the only place I find myself is back in the room of a hundred bunk beds, guarding the few possessions I&apos;ve accumulated in my time here.
The only thing I have space for is the words of the ones I betrayed. All the insanity of living and dying feels like a distant anecdote because it only lasted for two weeks of continuous time, and the threads on my wrist are the only proof of it, or else I&apos;d believe again that death was permanent.
The same day they called us to &apos;Victory Row&apos; was the same day the moon crossed the dome&apos;s threshold. We were grouped together by the train we came on: all of us the self-proclaimed &apos;strong&apos; with untenable beards and longer hair. It mystifies me how Vera still preserves most of her appearance: I guess that, to her, it is all she has left to obsess over.
&quot;Your time has come. I hope you&apos;ve all trained well,&quot; our same chaperon tells us. He&apos;s far older now, telling us he&apos;s been a level lower this whole time. 
I ask him about his age, and he shakes his head. 
He says, &quot;You might think we&apos;re the ones in power here. But all of us, captor or slave, are just pawns for the Afterlife.&quot;
I haven&apos;t seen Vera, Isla, or Jarrett in ages: they&apos;ve mostly kept to themselves. For so long, Vera thought her sister was still alive from what I told her, that &quot;they&apos;re all waiting,&quot; and after she realized the hollowness of my words, she refused to speak to me since.
&quot;Two-hundred-and-fifty-six of you will enter,&quot; he says. &quot;Most of you will lose your lives to the people next to you. But the few that persist will be the greatest champions of the Afterlife, earning your place among our ranks. This is why we raise the greatest soldiers in this entire world, the most fearsome force against all the other races. Because they&apos;re not only the best of their class: they&apos;re the best of the one percent of the one percent, hardened through learned bloodlust and vicious carnage, untouchable by any force of nature.&quot;
He points to the levels below.
&quot;You probably still wonder what happened to the ones that said they were weak that first day. They outnumbered all of you. That detail probably slipped your mind, didn&apos;t it?&quot;
Several of us nod.
&quot;They were the ones that kept you, our most valuable resource, alive and fed, so that you wouldn&apos;t succumb to the diseases and starvation that killed the majority of them. They keep the city of Blackwater fed, so that the civilians can raise new cadets to take their place. You are all the losers: producers or fighters, the weakest class, but the civilians are the victors of the Academy, the top third, the ones whose blood and intellect was great enough to keep them at the top, the genes we need. And you,&quot; he says: &quot;you are just the dirt we pan for specks of fools&apos; gold.&quot;"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":71,"ActNum":4,"ChapterPart":2,"ChapterFull":34,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":71,"Index":109,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"105","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Titus tries to reconcile his actions.

Every time I shut my eyes to sleep I&apos;m there again, and even in the face of peril, my mind refuses me a dream of peace and comfort, inching closer and closer to that unspeakable end I wrought upon them, thinking I could go back at whatever cost. 
I&apos;m not like them, and I will never be: the way the Afterlife indiscriminately kill to preserve their dream of a Golden Age, because my vision is real, and I can feel it waiting there on the other side.
How much I&apos;ve given to get to this point. My guilt is just a natural flaw that holds me from that path, and the more I forget that feeling of unity, the closer I get to that certainty I can make it to the end.
I dream of that windowsill, how many hours I spent waiting there, and anytime I sit in the silent echoes of the prison cells, I clearly remember that moment the anguish of failure finally suffocated that fear of evil. 
I looked at the girl sleeping next to me until she became a stranger, until I felt the truth that I was born a sacrifice, that I could field their hate and loathing forever if it meant they could be truly free.
And so I left the windowsill open, thinking she was asleep when I snuck between the buildings, unaware that I cast a silent shadow. I made the decision to act so I didn&apos;t have to later, and it made it easy: almost as easy as how defenseless the entire village was against itself.
But the memory always ends when I reach that unlocked door, when her voice picks up and stirs all the people awake, how angry I was with her that she held to that dream of another life with me.
But I did what I had to.

The cells on the second floor are shoddy. I can tell how ephemeral each cadet&apos;s stay was from the names etched into the walls as the last fading testaments that they were here. Paper scrawled in ink with last messages and poems, requests for messages to carry by those that survive. Several are names I recognized from roll call in the vast expanse below, but I&apos;m just shocked how many of them there are.
I nurse my headache from the time dilation before I lift the ink pen from the table. So many personalities scrawled on all these pages: blocks of misspelled words in short sentences of messy letters; others with perfect, arcing cursive; some with pictures or jokes; others as replies to past prisoners that have already lost.
<em>Dear Sylvia,</em> I write, but then I find myself staring at the vacant space beneath, waiting for my call with no answer. There&apos;s so much I didn&apos;t tell her when I had the chance, so many things this meager corner of a page couldn&apos;t hold. Maybe today I&apos;ll die, or tomorrow, and fate will drag me right back here again to the same blank corner to write it all again, or to stare at it, to either drown in the guilt of how I left them or count how many chances I wasted in expressing myself to her.
My head sinks to the desk. My soul is exhausted when all I do is preoccupy myself with busy work &mdash; just like I always have.
A knock saves me from all that history catching up to me: it rattles on the large steel door, and a latch beneath it opens.
<em>Strange, </em>I think to myself. <em>They already fed us.</em> I expect a silver tray to stick through the metal slat, but it&apos;s something else.
The visitor has manicured nails, nothing like that of any guard&apos;s&mdash;who would take the time to style themselves when all there is to do is dig and age?
&quot;Who&apos;s there?&quot; I ask. 
But before I can approach or catch a glimpse, the latch slams and I hear footfalls of the visitor running away.
I look down at the floor, and in the dim light I find a single slip of crumpled paper. I pull it at the edges, trying to discern the scrawlings written on both sides, and so I lift it towards the ambient light of the corridor.
There was little space to write anything, even narrower than that corner of a page I gave up on.The writing is deep purple and so neat it looks as if it were torn from a newspaper.
I read the first side.
&quot;YOU NEVER GAVE UP,&quot; it says.
And then I flip to the other side.
&quot;STAY ALIVE FOR ME.&quot; 
But that&apos;s all the stranger could manage. 
All I can imagine is that it&apos;s a mistake. 
I gave up on everyone.
So I re-crumple the note and throw it back in the hall before sprawling on the sheets of the small bed, my feet hanging over the sides, the sheets more sordid and rotten than the ones at my loft. 
All I can focus on now is preparing myself. And when the three hours passes, when the door unlocks and I&apos;m brought to the first trial, I tell myself that I&apos;m ready.
<em>Dear Sylvia, </em>the page reads. <em>You were wrong.</em>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":3,"AutoNameFull":72,"ActNum":4,"ChapterPart":2,"ChapterFull":34,"ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":72,"Index":110,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"106","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Titus approaches the first trial.

&quot;Decisiveness is a virtue. Only when you fully commit to anything, can you operate at your best. When you prioritize something, a people, your own life over others. Because when you hesitate, or when you make allowances for the weak, you both will die.&quot;
They blind our eyes with cloth so the words will carry resonance. To many they will fall on deaf ears. But to me, they speak the highest truth.
The only other sense I have is the coldness of my calloused feet on the ground, stripped of shoes just like all the others, and I can hear their footsteps in the jagged stone hall. At one point they counted us off in twos and divided us. When Isla figured out she was behind me, she tried calling my name to get my attention. 
It was a relief when they took her away.
The turbulent draft of air grows stronger as we march through the caves. It&apos;s how I can tell we&apos;re getting closer to one of the three hollow columns. I hear the rapid clattering of tools somewhere distant, high-pitched and fast like rusted fan blades, rasping shouts and voices as quick and indiscernible as mice feeding on scraps.
It&apos;s remarkable how quickly the lower Cadets that called themselves strong adjusted to this place &mdash; even Vera and her fireteam. They built relationships with each other, and those friendships made them weak. That&apos;s why now they regress to that same level of panic. The fools built something again they knew they would have to lose, and now that the Afterlife comes to collect on their promise, they shiver and tremble, chattering the chains that bind their wrists behind them, voices wavering, calling the names of allies and estranged loved ones for comfort: people they know they&apos;ll never see again.
It&apos;s then that I hear a word, softly, inches away from my ear.
&quot;Titus.&quot;
I nearly jump out of my skin.
&quot;Hang in there just a little while longer,&quot; a woman says.
I try to trace back the voice, but my eyes are covered, and the hallway gets darker as we walk through the last stretch. I never saw the full extent of what I wrought upon the Backwoods, only glimpses of the aftermath when the Afterlife apprehended me.
Could it be Sylvia? No. Impossible. And not Lyra either, though this voice carries the same softness of both of theirs. Maybe I forgot its texture after all these weeks. Maybe they ended up with me, coming from a different train car, maybe they got over it all, maybe they understood&mdash;
&quot;Use the thread. I can get you back,&quot; she insists. It catches me off guard, and when I about-face, the guards are quick to bash me back into rank.
There are few people I told this truth to, and most of them are dead.
&quot;Sylvia? Is that you?&quot; I ask. I feel an excitement rise in my chest&mdash;I can&apos;t remember the last time I spoke her name. But as soon as I catch myself in that moment of vulnerable sincerity, I remember the torturous hell of whatever trial awaits, and re-galvanize myself against it.
We stop when I run into the person in front of me. The wind whistles in my ears. My stomach drops, and I smell the burning of something living.
&quot;Decisiveness, as I said,&quot; the voice says. &quot;The ability to take action without hesitation. You will be tested on this today, whether you can prioritize strength over weakness. The losers will be mulch in the lowest gardens. Your flesh will rot to bone before the next round even begins!&quot;
I&apos;m near the front of the line. Through the pinhole lights I can guess four people in front of me. The smell of burning grows stronger: the same stench from the burning trade building, and the more I focus on that horrible odor, the more I have to fight to keep myself from losing it to that future memory of ash and soot; that promise of oblivion that forever hangs over my head.
&quot;All you have to do is make it across.&quot;
I breathe deeper. I meditate on that vision I&apos;ll earn at any cost, and I tense my weakened muscles in my cadaverous form.
I hear curses of two cadets as they yelp from some sudden pain.
It has begun.
&quot;No, no . . .&quot;
 Something sizzles like a dry scalding pan catching drops of water: one-two, one-two, as two smudges converge at full speed. Hesitating, they slow down as they approach, to the dismay of all the unblinded guards. I hear screams when they stop. The sizzling grows louder after the twelve seconds have passed, and when I hear the two cadets collide in to each other, wavering before they collapse without the balance of their bound hands, they fall headlong into oblivion, their voices high and shrill before they disappear into eternity.
&quot;Next!&quot;
Two more rush, and as I approach, I find I can see them easier, backlit by tendrils of moonlight and electric lamps. The nearest cadet shouts with all he has, drowning himself out of any chance of hesitation. On the far side, the other cadet stalls, but once their feet scald on the metal beam, they&apos;re forced to move without anywhere to go, jumping off the beam to hang on the side.
The closest cadet makes it to the other side without a hitch. I hear the sound of anguish when the fallen tries to left herself, only for the metal to burn her hands and cast her to the bottom along with the other two.
All that separates me from the start is one challenger. I step down as I approach into a puddle of cold water. I&apos;m still trying to get myself to that edge. I meant to drive that knife several weeks ago. It was my intention to kill. I&apos;ve changed. I&apos;m nothing like I was, and ever since that point I threw the hatch to leave my two closest friends to die, I&apos;ve been changed forever.
Another scream. I feel fingers fondle the knotted fabric of the blindfold. My stomach drops. I can feel the radiant heat of the beam, and I can&apos;t turn around no matter how much my instinct pleads me to.
&quot;Next!&quot;
I&apos;m already moving before the sensation of light returns to my eyes: feet wet, like walking in coals as they sizzle in the heat, scalding that thin layer of protection.
Thirty yards and I&apos;ll be there. I can&apos;t look into the eyes of the person across from me: all I can do is go lowest, drive straight, and hope I buck them from the rail.
My breaths are heaving, and my mind obsesses over how my steps pattern with them. Left. Right. In a straight line, no room for failure or else the timeless void will crush me before I reach the bottom.
Eight steps now. My feet start to burn so I clamber on my heel and toe. I can feel the other person getting closer, driving just as fast as I do, when in a breathless shout, I hear them.
&quot;Titus!&quot;
It&apos;s Delvin. The skin-and-bone redhead cadet that died to Endogeny in the last life; the one that tried to take Sylvia and get further with me; the pathetic runt weaker than she is. I load up all the anger: the jokes I heard he made about me and my restless fight to get to the top of the class, calling me a &quot;shut-in workaholic&quot; while Sylvia stood beside me. How angry I was, though I said nothing. Thinking he and his fireteam are better than us because of their rank when he contributes nothing to them, just drags them down. This world doesn&apos;t need him. I can remove him and nobody would notice. He deserves to&mdash;
&quot;Duck!&quot;
Step seventeen is on my left foot. I bend down, and it&apos;s just in time for my dominant leg to push with the last ounce of fleeting strength my emaciated muscles can muster. My body is so light. I float through the air, high enough that I can almost feel time&apos;s deceleration when Delvin ducks beneath me.
I realize the source of that voice when I cork halfway through the air, flipping sideways with my hands bound behind me. My head twists forward to continue on that same straight rush; my long, overgrown hair bobbing between my eyes before it springs back like my legs; my feet begrudgingly accepting the heat of the beam when they return.
The guards guffaw. I thought they&apos;d be angry at my moment of weakness&mdash;cast me from the beam, but all that matters is that they&apos;re amused.
I arrive on the other side, and turn around once it&apos;s safe to do so. Delvin meets my gaze and offers the slightest nod before continuing into the shadow of the tunnel. I see a hundred or so blindfolded cadets all waiting for their fate, knowing less than half of them will emerge from the shouts alone.
They push me forward as the next commencing shout reverberates. There is no comment or celebration, just the dwindling of fighters that trained their whole lives to throw it away in a pathetic game.
Somewhere my watcher witnessed everything. They told me to hold on no matter the cost but I cheated that, and despite saving threads on my recyclable life, I feel disappointed.
They return me to my holding cell. I commit the full scope of the snaking corridors to memory before they lock me away, though I know there&apos;s nothing I&apos;ll do.
On the desk sets a bountiful meal and a single apple. A tent card faces the caged window, overlooking another vacant column of air. I turn it around and read its scrawlings in the dim light, expecting it to be from my watcher, but the text is printed.
WELCOME FIREBRAND! CONGRATS ON YOUR SURVIVAL.

There&apos;s far less noise in the adjacent cells when I close my eyes to sleep, but across the hollow column I can hear sobbing of remorseful firebrands. Beyond this cell, I can make out the faintest, almond-shaped sliver of night sky, and I tell myself the bright colors of dawn are just hidden by the edges.
I trace my fingers across the threads of my wrist. How many more times will it take to be free? Is this privilege limited? And if so, can I see my loved ones again without having to return?
The cot is firm, but the static of exhaustion still rings in my ears. 
My mind blesses me with a kind dream this time, and reality dissolves in the space between sleeping and waking. 
I hallucinate her voice. &quot;If you take a nap now, you&apos;re not going to be able to fall asleep at darktime, Tie,&quot; her voice says, smooth as silk. &quot;Do you still want to meet Dad and Grandpa &apos;Ev at the park?&quot;
&quot;Where&apos;s Dad?&quot; My voice is small.
&quot;He&apos;s still on patrol &mdash; but if we don&apos;t catch him before he walks back, he&apos;ll come home and get all tired,&quot; Moira says. &quot;What&apos;s wrong? Why are you crying?&quot;
&quot;It was terrible! They took Ellie, and everyone died, and I was all all alone at the end,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;That was just a dream,&quot; she says.
&quot;But it all happened! I know it did. You died, and Everett killed you. He left you in the basement of the storehouse!&quot; Her expression remains perfectly still. How horrifying Chymaerans are when they portray their host. &quot;It&apos;s not really you.&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s so much more complicated than that,&quot; Moira says, &quot;but I was forced into a role I didn&apos;t want to steal. That decision was made for me. But that doesn&apos;t change the fact I love you. In fact, by the time I had Ellie, I had already been your mother longer than she ever was.&quot;
&quot;Where did you go?&quot; I ask. &quot;What caused you to leave us, was it Clint that night?&quot;
&quot;We&apos;re going to see them. And then you&apos;ll know everything. I know you&apos;ve waited so long, suffered over and over and over again, but you need to hang on just a little bit longer. But she&apos;s coming. And she&apos;ll take you to all of us.&quot;
I feel her hand cup the side of my face. The last sensation I feel of her is the coldness of her fingers as that touch dissolves away, and I&apos;m ripped awake on light sleep when something clatters on the floor in front of me.
The first colors of dawn are fixed in the almond-shaped sliver of sky, and orange radiates on every surface the sluggish sun shimmers. I reach for covers to throw aside, but the surface I sleep on is bare, and the left side of my face is cold from sweat.
Still half in that dream world, I squint my eyes and look at the floor, finding something black and reflective right in front of the steel door. I drop my cold feet to the floor and stumble forward.
The amethyst crystal faintly glows when I raise it, and I feel the energy of something calling to me. A scrap of paper is coupled to my necklace by the pendant&apos;s chain.
&quot;WE WILL MEET AGAIN AT THE END,&quot; it reads, and when I finally realize the source of these messages, I realize I was a fool to think it could have been anyone I knew.
I return the necklace to its rightful place around my neck, motivation for what I have to make it home to. But that past life shows me I just might have a chance if I can defeat the sender &mdash; my watcher &mdash; waiting to challenge me after I lost our skirmish beyond the train car. The Heiress of Purgatory is flooded by the Essence of the cadets she kills, the great beast of the Afterlife, the future weapon that will bring Blackwater to its fated end.
And if I can kill them, absorbing their Essence before the Afterlife can obliterate me &mdash; then Gods know how far back I can ride the thread, maybe all the way to the beginning of everything. I just need the courage to do whatever it takes, because the next time I&apos;ll have no chance to cheat or hesitate.
They don&apos;t waste any time keeping us in the cells. We&apos;re a commodity in mass-production, pinions in the gears of this great machine; so many to process with so little that last the eternal day. And so they force us from our cells to the next challenge, without a blindfold to cover our eyes, led through a new series of twists and turns to meet at the heart of the second floor: an arena adorned with rocks and uneven terrain.
They do nothing to mask the bright crimson colors from skirmishes long past. All the rocks light enough to lift are emblazoned with dried red. Instruments of war shimmer in the eternal dawn, where their cracks and scratches speak to decades of continuous abuse.
&quot;Form two lines,&quot; he instructs, and the firebrands swarm into two ranks: scrambling for the back, opposing the rush of any dining hall where they fought for first meal.
I&apos;m pushed to the front again, but all I want is just to get this over with before I lose that edge. I&apos;m too distracted with holding that mental toughness to recognize the firebrand that stands beside me, stripped of that pompous appearance granted to her by wealth and royalty. And when we realize our equal standing in both lines that approach the battlefield, she refuses to accept my camaraderie."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":74,"ActNum":4,"ChapterPart":3,"ChapterFull":35,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":74,"Index":113,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"109","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Titus and Vera argue.

&quot;Get over it, Vera,&quot; I tell her. &quot;We don&apos;t get a say here.&quot;
&quot;Then why didn&apos;t you tell me? You had me believe for weeks that she was still here, not dead somewhere on the streets of Blackwater!&quot;
I&apos;d apologize if it meant anything.
&quot;Why, Titus? Just tell me!&quot;
&quot;You couldn&apos;t handle the truth of what happened to her. You can&apos;t even handle your part in it,&quot; I say. &quot;She killed herself, alright? For absolutely nothing. Because your family made her think that&apos;s what she was worth!&quot;
&quot;I was the only one that reached out to her, out of all of them,&quot; Vera says. &quot;Vanna and Virgil are far too young to understand what makes her different in their parents&apos; eyes. You know I&apos;m the reason she&apos;s still on the estate, did she tell you that? Or have you just decided that I&apos;m the source of all her pain?&quot;
The first round of Firebrands skirmishes in front of us. Two more pairs shiver in anticipation. &quot;You should have been on that lift. But you didn&apos;t this time. Why didn&apos;t you go?&quot;
&quot;I couldn&apos;t leave things as they were. And that dragged all the rest of my fireteam into this mess,&quot; she says. &quot;I don&apos;t know how you know about the lift, what you mean by &apos;this time,&apos; but she was supposed to board with us, and I&apos;m the reason she was still on the list. I would never leave my sister to die, regardless of how much my mother Victoria hates her, believe me,&quot; she says.
&quot;All the fame and recognition. The top of her class, the star of Blackwater, and yet she died still trying to prove the value of the name she created,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Sylvia was wrong. This isn&apos;t a reality where any of us deserve to suffer. I can&apos;t accept any of this. And we need to survive no matter what it takes.&quot;
The next group is pushed into the crucible with nothing, told to scrounge for the tools that will grant them their survival.
&quot;Do you really think you can bring yourself to do it? I saw what happened in the train car, but, you know&mdash;&quot;
&quot;I can do it,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;And if it&apos;s Delvin? Or Isla? Or Jarrett? Then what makes us deserve to live over them?&quot;
&quot;Whoever clings to life the tightest wins. Whoever can persuade themselves of the most unshakable reason to survive will find that last strength when they need it.&quot;
&quot;And you think you have that,&quot; she says.
&quot;I have that more than anyone here. Because I still have hope. I know that I can save us. And I&apos;m not afraid of dying for that.&quot; I can convince myself if I commit it to words.
&quot;Everybody is already dead,&quot; she says. She bows her head. &quot;My sister. The whole rest of your fireteam. And Gods know if the others are alive. What&apos;s left for any of us when everything is gone?&quot;
 &quot;Whatever we can scrape from what remains.&quot;
We toe the line when the next pair leaves, realizing it&apos;s impossible to see the other side of the arena, besides the great wall marking its border two hundred yards out. Above us is another grand window to the sky, where continuous dawn radiates the rugged terrain in a thin orange haze, casting just enough light to shimmer the instruments of war strewn about the field.
My mind already spins the workings of a plan.
&quot;Divide and conquer,&quot; I say. &quot;We outmatch all of the cadets here. We have a solid shot here, Val, just don&apos;t lose your&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Val?&quot; She asks.
&quot;Vera. Sorry. Just don&apos;t lose that edge,&quot; I say.
From between the rocks, a single cadet emerges triumphant, grimaced with an expression of emotional exhaustion. 
&quot;Four went out, and one returns,&quot; says the guard tending the gates. The survivor has bruises all up their neck, eyes bloodshot, hands trembling as they shamble past the gate. &quot;Whatever you can find is a tool to get the upper hand. This is not about just having the courage to kill anymore. It&apos;s about plotting and following through.&quot;
We step in front of our usher, waiting for the moment of deliverance to come. He raises his arm and fires a flare into the air. The surge of anxious energy is electric, riding the nerves from my core into every extremity, charged with such energy it&apos;s unbearable to keep it inside.
The furthest flare blasts. Motion fires all my frail limbs at once, so starved from sedentary stillness that my feet tear the thin grass in tufts of dormant tan. I scan the ground for anything that can aid me: I was trained in everything they&apos;d teach me, far more than all these other frail firebrands.
I don&apos;t let the anticipation of the cadets on the other side to shake me from my focus. So many bloodied rocks are scattered with a signature stain on each of them, and in the shale sand, several broken blades of the cheapest metal crumple to age and wear.
All the good weapons are surely in the center, brought by every poor bastard that failed to use them well. I split right as Vera hangs left, hoping to find anything as I scrounge between the rocks. There&apos;s a pole-axe splintered in half, too top-heavy to drive it at anything and not lose it, but I grab it anyway, because if I can have any weapon whose iron isn&apos;t the quotient of spilt blood, it puts me high above fisticuffs and rocks.
It hangs uncomfortably in my white-knuckle grasp, holding an arm&apos;s-length of shaft at its jagged end. The eye of the metallic head wobbles at its shoulder, enough for no more than a single swing, but I&apos;m more afraid of that moral anxiety that made me hesitate in the train car, and as I approach the center of the long-abandoned growing chamber, I grow leery in the absence of conflict.
I spend a moment longer nestled in a burrow of rocks, holding my breath as I take in the faintest whispers in the air, but all I hear is the distant clatter of tools. Anticipation is half the mental battle, but too much of it leads to sloth, and the longer I wait for the signal of anything, the greater that voice of conspiracy rises.
Unable to wait any longer, I shamble to the top of the outcropping to take a higher view. Guns would be too quick a weapon for what they&apos;re trying to test here, and take too much maintenance to last any relative year. Bows would run out of arrows in an instant&mdash;Gods know how long Sylvia spent fletching for perfection only to use it for practice.
From the top I see both ends of the arena, but all I can see is entirely vacant. The next two pairs of cadets look on in fervent anticipation. I squint to follow their eyes, and they glare to that passage that Vera went down.
Alone they&apos;d be no match for one of us, but together, with the right strategy, they could wipe either one of us out.
I steady both hands on the unpolished metal axe as I approach the space where they wait, knowing this is now a battle of who dares the most, and if they&apos;ve already dared to split her skull before she could shout my name, they&apos;ll stop at nothing to send me to the Reservoir.
In a moment of distraction, my right foot slips on a bundle of rocks. It&apos;s too late to react, and before I can regain my footing I slide with them.
&quot;Got you, fucker!&quot;
My hands raise the axe before I can react. It&apos;s not a voice I recognize: the bastards have been hiding out here the whole time.
Vera&apos;s body is unceremoniously sprawled right in the center, and I&apos;m sure they left it there to dishearten me. They bludgeoned her head in before she could shout for help, crumpled on the ground like her sister as nothing but a bloody mess. Dragon Class or not, she stood no chance.
The rockslide makes the ground fluid like slipping on oil.
&quot;You stupid vagrant, you should have frozen with the rest of your kind in the outer walls,&quot; he says, before taking a swing at my head. I manage to lift the axe head, but as soon as the shoddy sword sparks against the steel, I lose my grasp and the face of it clocks me in the head.
Disoriented but finally free, I stumble to my feet. 
&quot;Where&apos;s your damn friend?&quot; I ask.
&quot;Above,&quot; he says, and once he points up, a full-size boulder crashes at my feet. It clips my toes. I screech with pain as it binds me to the center, crunching the bones of my feet as I stumble with my last good leg. All I have is the head of the axe, and I hold it awkwardly by the eye without the wooden neck.
&quot;Just give up,&quot; they say.
&quot;Not a chance.&quot; Trapped by the rock, the loose cartilage of my foot crunches like red-hot sand as I find my balance, but my adrenaline is too high to feel it: that&apos;s a debt of pain I take from my future self if I ever make it through this.
The first one makes a predictable high swing as the other scans for another rock: pinned like a dissected frog I have nowhere to go but face the lone firebrand head-on.
I dodge the blade of the rusted sword. He falters after expecting it to fully connect, and in his moment of vulnerability I feel myself hesitate when I remember all the bodies of the First Red; the chaos I created; the scope of devastation I never had the chance to assess.
The opportunity passes. Before I can retaliate another earthen mass crunches my skull, and I lay there helpless as my adversaries relish in their victory.
Dazed and furious, sprawled alongside Vera, I watch as they spare no mercy on us. &quot;If you weren&apos;t so goddamn green, you&apos;d have a chance,&quot; he says, before spitting down on me. He raises his boot, and I&apos;m dragged backwards once more before he can stomp my head in.
This time I can feel how saturated my circuits are with Essence, and before that tensile force can drag me any further into the countless hours I spent alone in my cell, I reach out with all the spiteful anger and regret I have, grappling for that limbic connection to return to the moments before I gave in to that pathetic sense of restraint.

My mind pulses when the splintered pole-axe slips from my hands. The tendrils of my conscious mind from moments later reach deep in this frail vessel as they puppeteer another lace of thread, and as my awareness overwrites every cell of my past failure, faster than the brain sends signals to the muscles, I dash directly for that outcropping, praying to whatever God or Goddess that grants me this thread that I&apos;m not too late.
My bare feet and hands scrape, stub, and slice on every sharp edge that can pull me there closer, and I no longer care about all the sound I make. In my future memory they laugh at me in my dying moments. Every breath wasted running is another chance for them to ambush her. I don&apos;t want to care about her, but there&apos;s this primal rage of humiliation and defeat that exhausts every ounce of life from my shambling corpse, and I can feel my circuits light with that otherworldly energy providing power where there is none.
There&apos;s a sound of scraping rock for a moment like chalk dragged on its edge, and I realize I&apos;ve found the first one. I glance from higher and see all three of them, right as Vera spots the lower cadet, mistaken that he&apos;s acting alone and defenseless. She could eviscerate them in swordplay, as I&apos;ve learned from years of facing their fireteam&mdash;but there are no tactics to stop a chunk of stone that plummets from the sky.
The actor draws back in fear towards the ambush. These firebrands are so used to weakness  at the bottom of their ranks that his expression is flawless, and Lyra wholly buys it.
She raises a dagger she found nestled somewhere in the rocks. &quot;This is nothing personal,&quot; she says.
The cadet with the stone is dumbfounded at the success of their plan, and struggles as he raises it to the ledge. It will be the last thought he has as I rush at him: with his hands full, he has no chance to react.
My whole body is just a vehicle for that white-hot fury to act on its own. I don&apos;t just want them to die, but I want them to suffer, and so when I drive the mass from the cadet&apos;s hands, I body him into the pit with my shoulder. He falls flat on the same surface Lyra&apos;s thoughts were splattered on, concussed from the shock of his head crashing against the asymmetries of the rock. It&apos;s the perfect crushing face.
Though my arms have withered to little more than emaciated lean muscle, I&apos;m able to lift the same stone with ease.
Vera draws back when she recognizes the cadets&apos; crafty ploy. Before she reaps retribution, I cast the stone from atop the ledge, ensuring I don&apos;t make the same mistake that they did.
The loud crunch is satisfying in that brief moment. Sprawled in his back, the cadet panics when he realizes he can no longer move his legs, and both the adversaries below watch in disbelief. Lungs crushed, he has no breath to scream, only a mind to process the useless pain he can no longer resist.
My anger is as blind as that endless injustice I suffered, and with their lives, I will paint my surroundings with their entrails until every debt has been repaid. I heave another rock, and another, until every hard part of the flesh puppet below is liquefied from the trauma, and when the unspeakable horror moves the two cadets below so far that they tremble, I join them.
The other cadet brandishes a feeble knife that couldn&apos;t cut spiderwebs, and when he lunges, all that persists in my mind is that last sight of him smiling, triumphant, calling me weak as he spits on me.
He tries another jab, but he&apos;s too slow. I&apos;ve been trained as a killer and I no longer hesitate. Grasping his arm, I twist and punch beneath his shoulder in a space that shatters his ribcage. He still manages to hold the knife in a death grip, and slices again off-balance, managing to connect with my arm.
I bash again at his ribs. I tension my fingers in his hair though he still refuses to let go.
&quot;Die, fucker!&quot; He manages, and right as he tries to strike me again, another dagger digs deep into his neck.
Vera stands beside me, her eyes wet, gasping for breath as she wipes the residue of the last cadet off her uniform. But as the loser chortles away on the last wet breaths of life, I refuse to waste it.
I can tell he&apos;s dead when his weak trail of Essence flows in to me, but that doesn&apos;t matter. He goes limp when I bash his head against the jagged wall, again and again and again, until none of his pathetic shit-eating grin is left to taunt me, just a gaping hole.
I take the knife from the ground because there&apos;s still more canvas to paint.
&quot;Titus, stop this! It&apos;s over,&quot; Vera pleads.
But my hands are moving on their own, carving this cadaver whose soul departed moments ago. Stabbing, and stabbing, and stabbing, until there&apos;s no blood left to drain, until I&apos;m blue in the face and feel so much worse than when I started.
I fall to my knees though my eyes refuse me tears. I can feel the pulse of the life still in my veins. Vera extends a wet hand to lift me, and so I let her, limping across the battlefield as the Afterlife come to collect their mulch for the lower gardens.
We don&apos;t speak another word as she drags me, tugging at the arm I&apos;ve extended around her shoulders. My hands tremble from shock, and when the adrenaline fades, all I&apos;m left with is the price that all those acts of violence cost.
She drops me at the entrance, too disgusted to turn around and watch.  They drag me off to my cell where another meal waits, another place card of congratulations telling me I&apos;m one step closer to the end.
I refuse to eat that night. 
The Afterlife heals my wounds with a small transfer of Essence to the parted flesh. I&apos;ve proved myself as a valuable asset with a chance. I&apos;ve done everything I had to in order to survive, and now that I&apos;ve crossed this line, nothing can hold me back from returning to claim my perfect end."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"No Holds","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Four","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Thirty-Six","ActNum":4,"ChapterPart":4,"ChapterFull":36,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":115,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"111","Synopsis":"Titus decides a piece of himself is no longer useful.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"4.36","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

I had no choice.
They would kill me if I didn&apos;t kill them first. 
I had to send a message. 
I had to prove that I was valuable, and if Vera couldn&apos;t do it, I had to step in and do it myself. 
They&apos;d crush and humiliate me the same way. 
Or it was an accident that I ended up here in the first place. 
I was forced into this. 
I never meant to kill, what else could I do? Would I rather be dead with the rest of them, or have a chance to live?
It was only a day between the first and second trial, but now around two sleepless days have passed since they returned me here. All I have left is just my imagination to fill the spaces between these dreamless hours. I&apos;m unable to obey the cycle my biology demands when the sky still glows with that same color of dawn.
<em>Do you really want this anymore?</em> I ask myself. <em>Is it worth it? </em>Because ever since the second meal passed beneath the door uneaten, my dreamless fantasies have spilled over into the waking world. My past self would shun the miscreant that shutters reality, basking in their own internal paradise, but for once I&apos;ve earned this. Maybe Sylvia was right to tell me there was nothing else out there, because it was blank and unfulfilling, just a myth I told myself to suffer on.
<em>There</em>&apos;<em>s only so much a person can take,</em> I thought at some point down the line. And I was right. Because now when I stare at the ceiling, I see the same shapes I found in the cracks at my Academy loft, and I&apos;m home.

Somewhere beyond the Academy towers, the midday Sun melts all the snow from the ground. My room is furnished: Clint and Moira helped me decorate it when I first arrived here, and loving scribbles from my younger sister decorate the walls in place of paintings.
I was never alone. Because there&apos;s been someone alongside me this whole way.
&quot;I want you to know that I&apos;m always watching you, ever since the orphanage, ever since you saved me from it,&quot; she says. &quot;And I forgive you for what you&apos;ve done, Titus. Shouldn&apos;t effort always equate to love? Shouldn&apos;t you only ever be expected to try, just to participate, to accept the end whether or not you succeed?&quot;
&quot;I guess,&quot; I tell her. If I really want it, I can see her there, and I want it. She glows with the same colors of the Goddess I witnessed moments before I lost her.
&quot;You&apos;re safe here, Titus,&quot; she says. &quot;You can let go now. You tried, and that&apos;s all that should matter.&quot;
I rest my head on her shoulder and she brushes my hair with her fingers. I can feel her. She&apos;s really there, sitting next to me, the refuge I&apos;ve sought since the beginning though I hadn&apos;t the words to ask.
&quot;It&apos;s you. It&apos;s you and it&apos;s always been,&quot; I repeat. It keeps her here. I tremble at the thought that it&apos;s my own fingers pulling the surly tangles from my hair. 
&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;
&quot;But I left you! I gave up on everything we could have had,&quot; I tell her.
She doesn&apos;t answer.
My arms tension further around my scrawny, naked body, unable to wear the bloodstained trousers without rolling the edges up or else they won&apos;t fit. My hunger makes it so hard to hold on. Nothing stays in my stomach. And when my head dips in my lap, after I make myself small in the corner of the room, I hear the door open. 
Someone enters wearing thick boots, but I refuse to acknowledge another guard telling me to eat. It&apos;s just my imagination. The pangs of hunger are preferable to all the other thoughts fighting for the forefront of my mind, giving me the pained solace of one-pointedness, keeping me on the edge of a pit that has no bottom.
I won&apos;t let myself feel the guilt of giving up. I&apos;m in the loft again, and if I close my eyes I can feel the contours of this space. The smoke is gone. Firebrands laugh somewhere in the lower rooms. There&apos;s a party for Romin. I&apos;m gathering my things before I spend the night in the Compound, drinking  the night away in the same spaces we all played as children. Even Valentina will be there, and she never goes to the Compound.
The voice is light and soft, a mistaken Cadet in the wrong room after a drunken night out.
&quot;It&apos;s really you,&quot; she says. I feel her shadow looming directly over me.
&quot;You&apos;re in my room. This is private,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;You&apos;re really here,&quot; she says.
&quot;Of course I am,&quot; I say. &quot;I live here.&quot;
&quot;Do you not recognize me? Hey&mdash;why won&apos;t you look at me?&quot; She asks.
&quot;Get out,&quot; I demand, and I&apos;m furious again when I feel this grasp on freedom slipping away. 
&quot;You need to listen to me. There&apos;s hardly ever a moment they&apos;re not watching. You just have to hang on&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Get out!&quot;
&quot;Quiet, Tie! Please, just listen&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Get out! Get out of here!&quot; I yell, and it frightens her enough to cast her out. &quot;I hate you! I&apos;ll kill you, I swear to the Gods, I&apos;ll fucking destroy you! Leave me alone!&quot;
I bash my fists against the walls until they bleed. She quickly latches the door behind her when she retreats, and I&apos;m back again, spending all the energy I don&apos;t waste to hunger painting this fragile picture before it can be shattered again.
The air is warm. The windows are open. Valentina invited us to celebrate downtown. I&apos;m taking the gondola with Sylvia later, and she&apos;s getting ready, actually trying this time, instead of letting her damp hair hang unbrushed like she did almost every morning. I can smell the perfume Valentina gave to her that holiday. She wears the dress I picked for her. And tomorrow I&apos;m spending the day with Clint and Moira, taking Ellie to the park where I&apos;ll teach her everything I know about the Academy because she graduates from Seminary in three days.
&quot;Nothing can ever hurt you again,&quot; Sylvia says. I can feel her there if I want to, and I do.
&quot;I wish I could touch you,&quot; I say.
&quot;I know,&quot; she says. &quot;But at this rate, you never will.&quot;
I give up on that dream for now. My shame is hard enough to resist. I shiver though my arms wrap around me, bringing neither warmth of the body or heart, knowing that without death, there is no other option.
There can only be one left at the end of this path."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":77,"ActNum":4,"ChapterPart":4,"ChapterFull":36,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":77,"Index":117,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"113","Synopsis":"","Summary":"The prisoners form groups of four, and it is revealed that they must betray each other.

And now, in the final test before your truest worth is measured, just as tens of thousands have gone before you, you will prove your ability to survive as a team.&quot;
The warden pauses as she consults with her faculty. Her voice echoes so far and wide it feels ever-present. We stand at the center of another growing chamber, verdant trees and grass contrasting this one from the sparse desert of the other. People look even scrawnier when their soul is drained from them, because when I look around at the survivors on this Victory Row, I know three days couldn&apos;t wither them away this much.
I hear Isla behind me. &quot;What happened to Jarrett, Vera? Where is he?&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t know, I haven&apos;t seen him,&quot; she says.
&quot;He was before me,&quot; says Delvin. &quot;I caught a glimpse of him, but only his partner returned.&quot;
&quot;We all knew the four of us wouldn&apos;t make it,&quot; Delvin says. &quot;But I&apos;m sure the three of us can still pull through, right?&quot;
This arena has a makeshift sitting area from the tiered steps of growing spaces, and I&apos;m taken aback by the number of Royal Guardsmen in the stands. It&apos;s obvious they&apos;re the officers of the Afterlife, and from the pads of paper they scribble on, I&apos;m sure that they&apos;re recruiting.
Halfway between the entrances, along the wall of stone bleachers, is the warden of this timeless garden. To her left are the functionaries watching each floor, and to her right is the massive Chymaeran known as the Heiress of Purgatory.
&quot;Attention, Firebrands!&quot; Her voice fills the chamber as she raises her hands toward the fading colors of dawn. &quot;The death of night marked the beginning of this great contest of champions. So far you&apos;ve proved yourselves as something better than all the shitbloods that raised you, and just as morning fades from early colors to bright day, so too does your life have a chance to begin again.&quot;
She draws a pause as if expecting applause from her prisoners, but the only chorus of cheers comes from the spectators that have no part in this bloodshed. Every word is just formality.
&quot;In the beginning, the lowest cadets in the Academy were nothing but living mulch, tending the gardens they would feed with their own bodies. But with the succession of Ullrich as the Grandmaster General, we reshaped the ancient growing grounds into the greatest combat powerhouse the world has ever seen.&quot;
She points to all of us. 
&quot;You are the best of the brave. The chance was offered once your proved yourself upon arrival here. And instead of being ground down for every ounce of energy you can provide&mdash;like the weak that harvest far below these levels for the rest of their lives&mdash;you have a chance to be even greater than the classes of cadets that were once better than you.&quot;
The Royal Guard surround the arena in an evenly spaced-circle.
&quot;What began with 256 cadets, in this class, has dwindled to a mere 60. You will be building your own fireteams now for our last exam. Separate into groups of four. You have one minute to decide,&quot; she says.
Commotion rises between the survivors, and soon, the whole space is a cacophony of noise. I feel hands on my shoulder, pulling me every which way, my peers evaluating me for height and muscle though I&apos;m average height and look even more like a vagrant.
&quot;Get him. Titus!&quot; Isla says. She pulls me their way, but Vera resists.
&quot;He&apos;s a ruthless murderer,&quot; she says.
&quot;So what? He spared my bloody-damn life,&quot; Delvin says. &quot;Look around. Those are the only people left. Even me.&quot;
I&apos;m apathetic to the choice, because either way I&apos;ll be forced out the end as the lone survivor.
&quot;We&apos;re the only ones here that recognize him for his skill,&quot; Isla says, &quot;it would be a waste.&quot;
&quot;Now step apart and space yourselves evenly,&quot; the Warden orders. 
A Royal Guardsmen approaches each circle with four different marks bunched in his hands. Isla&apos;s as quick on the uptake as I am, but the others don&apos;t get it yet.
The Warden continues. &quot;Should you be chosen to fight in our ranks, there are many friends that will become enemies. The ones you cared for the most will remain shitbloods. They are the weak, the fodder for the cause raised like cattle, and if you refuse to see it that way, then you are useless.&quot;
The Royal Guardsmen hands me a green-colored mark. Isla gets blue. Vera gets red, and Delvin gets yellow.
&quot;Wait, we&apos;re not together for this?&quot; Isla panics, and Vera wears the same expression. &quot;I can&apos;t do this. Not a chance.&quot;
Delvin says, &quot;This is what all of this has been about. The courage to betray and the strength to separate, just like the Afterlife that betray their own race.&quot;
&quot;You can&apos;t tell me you&apos;re buying into this?&quot; Isla asks. &quot;Are all of you mad?&quot;
The Warden continues. &quot;This game will only end when all the cadets still standing wear the same color.&quot;
Four banners drape from four equally-spaced sides, and against our collective will we&apos;re divided. I&apos;m surrounded by strangers with green marks hanging behind them, nor a single one I recognize, and I watch every cadet eyeing another surviving friend of a different color.
There&apos;s a small room beneath each banner that once held supplies to tend the gardens, but the racks of rakes and spades have been replaced with the same shoddy weaponry from the last arena. Two-hundred-something extra marks are bunched in the back. 
My teammates first fight over shields, then swords, until all that&apos;s left is just bows and arrows and daggers. I manage to grab a sword that fell behind the racks. It&apos;s in a better condition than all the rest, and when I step outside, I test its weight in a couple practice slashes.
A hand grabs my shoulder, and when I turn around, it&apos;s a taller cadet that studies my face.
&quot;Why do you look so familiar? You&apos;re not some vagrant, you&apos;re a Firebrand, aren&apos;t you?&quot;
It takes a moment for the realization to register: to all of us it&apos;s been more than four months since we saw the outside.
&quot;You were the valedictorian of our class,&quot; he says. Others turn at the utterance of the word. &quot;I&apos;m Zane, I remember seeing you in the Compound with Romin. You were, uh . . . Tiras. No. Titus, right? Titus Berguard? How in the Gods&apos; name did you end up here?&quot;
The fifteen green firebrands circle around us. Zane raises his voice to the others. &quot;It&apos;s the valedictorian, everyone! Class Four. Titus,&quot; He says.
Their faces light with some thought of salvation or relief, falling to the same desire for order those cadets at the inner walls did.
&quot;You can lead us,&quot; he insists. &quot;Tell us how to win.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m no better than any of you are,&quot; I say.
&quot;No, bullshit. You have to,&quot; another says. &quot;Someone has to organize a strategy, or else we&apos;re all going to die alone.&quot;
Our makeshift squadron stands in silence. They wait for my reply, begging for some assurance of order. I peek between them at the other parties, already beginning to organize into groups. A hundred-or-so feet away to the right, Delvin stands at the center of Yellow. To the left, Vera&apos;s recognized from her secondhand fame as a commander of Red. And somewhere through the dense patch of forest, Isla reconvenes with her blue team, though I&apos;m unsure whether all of them are leaders.
&quot;What do we do?&quot; Zane asks.
&quot;There&apos;s no terrain here like the last arena. It&apos;s all flat. This isn&apos;t a battle of cunning or strategy, all they intend for this to be is just a battle of bloodshed and attrition with few survivors,&quot; I say. &quot;They don&apos;t want us to organize. They expect that if we hold to our old alliances, we&apos;ll refuse to join the new team.&quot;
&quot;It makes sense,&quot; says Zane.
&quot;The only victor can ever be the one that will do whatever it takes, no matter how dirty their hands get. You will all kill without hesitation or else you are worthless,&quot; I say.
They still scan the distant colors for the faces of surviving friends, and I know it will be our downfall. 
&quot;To me, everyone I care about is already dead. But it&apos;s made me realize a truth that I knew all along, that when you strip away all the petty distractions of love and passion, we are only tools, only ever be measured by how useful we are, deserving nothing more and nothing less. We deserve nothing in this life. All we get is what we&apos;re given. Love is a hollow word for something that can never persist in such a cold place, because all we were ever made for is just to fight!&quot;
I hope I can change their minds even if just for a second. I won&apos;t make an effort to learn their names because I&apos;m leading them to die.
&quot;Every man and woman is born into this world alone and dies alone. So what is commitment but an illusion if it doesn&apos;t hold at either end?&quot;
They&apos;re beginning to accept it, just enough.
&quot;We are alone together in this moment and we&apos;ll stop at nothing to preserve that. There is no salvation, no bright future or end for any of us but the cold peace of death that we&apos;ll reach either way. Let us be born again to the Reservoir whenever our last breath comes, but today, we&apos;ll fight with everything we have!&quot;
A blinding flare launches towards the top of the chamber as I finish those last words, snaring in that timeless space somewhere above us like a fixed star."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":3,"AutoNameFull":78,"ActNum":4,"ChapterPart":4,"ChapterFull":36,"ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":78,"Index":118,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"114","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"4.36.78","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"QEGU","Body":"
&quot;Kill them all!&quot; 
The words are mine. I&apos;ve earned them.
I run behind the first cadets I goaded to the front; it wasn&apos;t hard finding the stupidly-courageous ones with tombstone courage. I learned from the best, because if Romin can lead a third of our bravest cadets to die for nothing, then I can scrape the shit from the bottom of this barrel.
I know the upper two-thirds of Academy Cadets are the leaders of battle. All they&apos;re raising here are the mindless grunts to soil their own hands. These people would all die anyways. I feel nothing when I steady the steel blade to drive into my first victim&apos;s chest. Arrows whiz overhead. The cowardly rangers have already begun their barrage, though they no nothing of how to properly aim and fire a bow and arrow.
&quot;Keep going, all of you,&quot; I insist. &quot;Don&apos;t hesitate, not for a moment, or else you kill all of us. Feast on their reluctance!&quot;
For a moment all we hear is the clatter of footsteps from smudges of color between the trees. But as soon as clashing metal breaks the air, the screams of war are all that follow.
We are all instigators of coerced savagery. All that divides us now is whether we see ourselves as victims or champions. I can see it in every brutal attack and hapless defense, that difference of predator and prey only split by a thin mental line. Vicious green carves and slashes at everything because they&apos;ve taken my hollow gospel to heart. It becomes so easy after the first, as if I&apos;ve unlocked the full extent of all my training I received for the first time. Any skirmish on the training field stopped at first injury, but here, there is no end.
All I remember is the adrenaline-fueled blur of mindless savagery. There is no line between the reality I deserve and the penance I refuse, so I bash, slash, carve, and slice at everything that holds a pulse and stands to destroy me, regardless of death or life or the accumulating threads on my wrist, because all I persist as is just a vessel for the purpose of which I was instilled, a force of nature as definite as snow and ice with no means but a long-decided end that forever will be path-independent, as merciless as all of nature and the&mdash;
Her hands tremble when they grasp the blade. She&apos;s so small that I didn&apos;t see her when she approached behind me to put her hands on my shoulder, defenseless, not even holding a weapon.
She was never meant for combat, but she was so bright and brilliant, and I never accepted how she fell for me.
&quot;Titus . . .&quot; She moans, spitting blood from her lips. &quot;What . . . have you . . .&quot;
I look down at my steady hands that still hold the hilt, unable to believe that they&apos;re attached to me. I almost lose it, that edge, and I&apos;m so Gods-damn close but I hold on to it, just a little bit longer.
This body was made to work, not to live. The fruitless labor of all my sacrifice has led to nothing, so I will become the sacrifice.
I meet her eyes and twist and pull, tearing her soul from her body in the same motion with all her Essence.
&quot;You fucking bastard, Titus!&quot; Delvin yells.
&quot;Is this not &apos;what all this has been about?&apos; Are you too weak for your words?&quot; I ask him, because his anger makes it easier.
&quot;All the extra marks in each room. She was trying to tell you &mdash; that there&apos;s enough marks of one color for all of us!&quot;
&quot;They will never let that pass. The only color we&apos;ll wear is red,&quot; I say, and in the center of the field I slash at him. &quot;You pathetic twig, you&apos;ll never be good enough!&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m everything you wish you could be,&quot; he says. Our words find air where all our training reduces everything to muscle memory.
&quot;And what is that?&quot;
Every opening I find he counters.
&quot;You&apos;re brilliant but hollow, strong but so emotionally weak, and that&apos;s why you&apos;ve always been holding her back.&quot;
I parry. He blocks.
He says, &quot;Because you don&apos;t love yourself enough to give her anything, but I can.&quot;
&quot;I watched her die,&quot; I say.
It catches him off-guard. I move for that perfect lunge, but something else stops me, something warm in my side, and I realize that someone else returned Isla&apos;s favor.
&quot;Then I hope you never see her again, not in any afterlife,&quot; Vera says.
The steel is sharp, but my will is stronger than all of theirs together. I drive my sword behind me before my hands can give out, and with the momentum of hard contact, I spring directly for Delvin, forcing Lyra&apos;s sword between his ribs to empty him of all that disgusting self-love.
We all fall together in the center. So few cadets remain in this ring, but when I see Green approach and end the last of their fireteam&apos;s suffering with short stabs to the neck, I know we&apos;ve won.
The mission is the highest form of love. This mission is sacrifice, the greatest crowning gift any living being can ever bestow. And when I meditate on all I&apos;ve lost to make it this far, it&apos;s the only reason I live long enough to save this thread until the Royal Guard tend my wounds with Essence."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Reward/The Vassal","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Five","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Thirty-Seven","ActNum":4,"ChapterPart":5,"ChapterFull":37,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":119,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"115","Synopsis":"Titus reaches an unexpected end.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"4.37","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

Among the surviving members of the Green, the Royal Guard call me the champion of Victory Row; the most vicious; their ideal candidate to fight as a grunt on the front lines. Immediately after the last challenge, the Warden demands my presence. And when I step into her office&mdash;adorned with the priceless trinkets and artifacts all her prisoners relinquished&mdash;she praises me for my ruthlessness, on a level like like &quot;none of the other failures in this Gods-forsaken pit.&quot;
She paints me the vision of a future I&apos;ve already witnessed, expecting the truth to captivate me.&quot;You&apos;re part of the last batch of Cadets being processed here, the last graduation now and forevermore,&quot; she starts. &quot;You&apos;ve proven you understand the sacrifice of self-preservation and the courage it takes: the force that keeps true Humans alive. And because of that, you are one of the few that might deserve to walk among us.&quot;
I bow my head in compliance knowing this pact is ephemeral. I can predicate her words before she speaks. All I can think of is the last step in this plan, and hope the Essence is enough to pull me all the way back. Because as sure as water finds its way to the lowest point, I will slay this abomination in any number of lives, then end myself.
&quot;The Heiress of Purgatory is the one that will decide your worth. You know how we feel as the overseers of this program, but she has the power to  decide where you fit.&quot;
&quot;I am honored by your consideration,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;She will test you now,&quot; she says, gesturing to the guards to lead me down the hall. &quot;She feeds on the Essence of all the weak and broken failures here. You will give your best or else you will join them.&quot;
&quot;Understood,&quot; I say. &quot;I will not disappoint you, or anyone, that trusts in my skill.&quot;
They guide me through the corridors. We pass a cart of the dead cadets being taken away to their final use. I see the unstaring eyes of Vera somewhere beneath them, but I refuse to allow my stomach to twist at the sight. This world, after all, is just the sawdust of that perfect reality, to be blown away on the winds of change.
Half a year of my life has passed, and for the first time in ages, we approach the stairs. I expect us to head up and into the stale sunlight of eternal day, but we head further down into the depths. The nausea of relativity sickens me, but I&apos;ve learned to hold my breath to retain the meager scraps in my stomach. I&apos;m half the weight I was when I walked the same set of stairs, but there&apos;s still a spark of strength in my muscles I&apos;ve maintained through all of this.
&quot;You know, Ullrich&apos;s order to switch this place to a combat zone came through only two days ago,&quot; one guard says to the other. &quot;How long has it been for us?&quot;
&quot;A bloody damn eternity,&quot; the other replies.
&quot;And only a day to process half the Cadets remaining on the lower floors. There were a hundred thousand of them, can you believe it?&quot;
&quot;If only they&apos;d tell us what&apos;s coming.&quot;
<em>The end,</em> I think. <em>The end of you, and the end of everything. </em>But I keep it to myself. They know nothing of what I witnessed at the rightful fall of the First Red.
We descend from the second floor to the fourth, the deepest I&apos;ve ever been. Every transition feels like sinking in molasses, as if the air were thicker, like diving deeper and deeper into a bottomless lake. Only five days of waking time have passed since I was last down here, but I&apos;m certain it&apos;s not relativity that makes it feel longer. I can&apos;t tell a single face from the masses I spent half a year with, and when I go even deeper, the smell and sight of age and destitution only grows stronger.
&quot;Level four, so. . . two days, times seven, times seven, times seven again . . . times ten . . . is how long?&quot; the first guard says.
The number clicks in an instant.
&quot;An awful long time,&quot; the other says. &quot;Look how old these shitbloods are. We got more up top to replace &apos;em, right?&quot;
<em>Sixty nine hundred days</em>, I think. <em>Almost nineteen years down here, in the time the moon touches the horizon twice.</em>
&quot;They say it&apos;s all Ahkvasan tech from ages ago,&quot; one says.
Black cloaks drag across the sultry ground as pale phantoms tend the plants and heavily inbred livestock. Cadets in their fifties, sixties, seventies and older don&apos;t even turn to look at the relative vigor of my skin-and-bones. The concentric wheels atop the dome are so distant, but now I can see the centermost circles when they spin.
There&apos;s a blocked-off, private circle of almost two acres in the center of this edgeless floor, in the dead center of the three vacant pillars of light, right below where the last arena would be two floors above. The walls are smooth unlike the jagged, cavernous surfaces of the rest of this labyrinth. 
When I enter, I feel the artificial glow of an ever-burning Essenced flame lighting the top of this space as a false sun. My eyes struggle to adjust to the ambient light, but sure enough, I know what awaits me without a second glance. At the center of it all is the harbinger of the end, and around her, the Human-and-Chymaeran  colonists from the Afterlife watching over her. Her height in full Chymaeran form now reaches the first-story eaves of the buildings. This false mortal goddess is so much stronger than I remember&mdash;flooded with such Essence that from twenty yards away, my circuits raise gooseflesh on my arms.
Her voice is ever-present and commanding.&quot;Leave us. This one is mine,&quot; I hear, and I&apos;d be petrified looking up if my anger were any lesser. The others scatter, and I find myself ten paces away from the Heiress. Fighting her in this state would be like fighting Ryder&apos;s statue if it sprung to action and tried to wipe out a whole city block.
&quot;All the champions of Victory Row have come and passed. Some have lived and will fight alongside me. Others have lost it all.&quot;
The half-blood Chymaeran begins to transition. Slender limbs of obsidian re-morph into the texture of flesh&mdash;and who knows if this isn&apos;t just the guise of another one of her victims. The crux of everything I loathe stands before me as a Human woman. And when the tar dissolves from her body, into garments and hair brighter than my half-year&apos;s first dawn, she stands no taller than I am.
&quot;A thousand cycles, and you stand before me as the only one I&apos;ve truly waited for all this time.&quot;
&quot;You should have killed me when you had the chance,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Why did you resist? Why did you purge the Chymaeran Curse?&quot;
&quot;Because I&apos;m the reason you got it in the first place,&quot; she says, and I remember the last moments I witnessed. It was a smudge of black when i threw open the door to find the window ajar, the curtains dancing on frostbitten winds, and the first syllable of my sister&apos;s name before all my senses were robbed from me.
&quot;You took her.&quot; I can&apos;t say the words without shuddering. &quot;This whole time, having me believe the only soul I&apos;ve ever cared for in this life is dead! Tell me, is she still alive?&quot;
&quot;You&apos;ll be meeting her soon, no matter how this ends. That Thread can only lead you to one place: you probably think you&apos;re tethered from some distant beginning. But did you ever stop to think you&apos;re being dragged towards an unavoidable end?&quot;
&quot;I can change everything,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;m more a God than you will ever be, Mask. Because the only future I&apos;m tied to is draining all the Essence from your lifeless corpse!&quot;
The stewards part before this crucible can burn any hotter, and even the guards leave us.
&quot;You were too pathetic to save your friends &mdash; so pathetic you let them die,&quot; she says.
&quot;Shut up.&quot;
&quot;You betrayed them, then killed them, all for nothing, Tie.&quot;
&quot;Shut the hell up!&quot; My nails bite the flesh of my pallid palms as the hate magnetizes me to her, fists drawn.
She says, &quot;And your sister? She deserved everything she got, along with that bastard father of hers. Both their deaths were long and painful.&quot; My feet scuttle faster than my muscles can handle. &quot;But you, Titus, I&apos;ll make sure yours is&mdash;&quot;
I feel my knuckles crack when they drive square into her chest. The shock travels up my frail bones while she hardly moves a step, and whether it&apos;s thick Chymaeran scaling or solid muscle, my hands won&apos;t tell until it&apos;s over. But she doesn&apos;t smile with a sadistic smugness. She&apos;s still watching all her handlers as if our final skirmish is just a performance. 
&quot;You fucking bitch!&quot; I try the same hand again and coerce the answer, only to find if when the searing agony alarms all the nerves in my splintered arm.
I yelp when I withdraw, and I think she&apos;s found her chance to strike when she lunges for me, playing with her food, but there&apos;s still that same sense of hesitation from when we fought beyond the train car. 
She stopped herself from reaching for me. I can see a crack in this abomination&apos;s armor: something that makes me different from all the others she&apos;s ruthlessly killed, but I just don&apos;t get it. No. She gets off on the torment, watching me suffer somehow knowing the thread will just bring me back here again.
But everyone boils over at some point. Though my muscles are gone, my mouth still waters, and I spit on her when she draws close again.
&quot;Fight me, you whore!&quot;
I try to hide my wincing when I&apos;m left with my weakest arm. That&apos;s when she takes her first swing: a slow left hook, telegraphing it all the way to my face though I&apos;m still too slow and spent to dodge it.
It still spills me across the floor, and when I land on my right arm I shriek in agony: out of all the places to land, and my arm is fractured further over a small rusted garden trowel.
I still raise myself to my knees, then my feet, taking the dulled divot tool in my non-dominant hand.
&quot;You&apos;re going to kill me with <em>that</em>?&quot; She asks.
&quot;Not this time,&quot; I say, and I flip it around in the palm of my hand.
I catch her in a moment of confusion before she can pummel the rest of me. I find that same space I drove the sword into Delvin, and without that stupid self-love he died on, I doubt anything will leak from me when it parts the soft meat between my ribs.
But she&apos;s quicker than me. Afraid, even, and she shouts while she ejects the spade from my grasp. It still manages to slice me like paper when it&apos;s driven a thumb&apos;s-length in, and I feel an amethyst pain when her hands crumple my wrists and we fall backwards together.
&quot;You&apos;ll win again, and again, a thousand times&mdash;no&mdash;a million times, even more, and just one time, you&apos;ll make a mistake. Kill me now. I&apos;ll meet you again real soon, just do it. Do it!&quot; I plead her, but she&apos;s just bent over me with her hands pinning my biceps, as if she&apos;s too afraid to make the next move. &quot;Do it! Just let me go. All I&apos;ve ever loved is gone.&quot;
I feel a wetness on my face as the amethyst floods my veins. My eyes are too dry to cry, even when the end of this long cycle is just moments away.
&quot;Just hang on,&quot; she says.
&quot;Huh?&quot; I manage.
&quot;Just hang on for me,&quot; she says, as the tears fall from her eyes, but before I can answer, the same pitch black oblivion overtakes me, and I can feel my soul still hanging here, barely, on the next thread just waiting to burrow through my flesh. I feel dragging, then heat, then stretching time, then bitter cold, until every sensation eludes me and all I&apos;m left with is the slow beating of my heart.

My senses awaken to the feeling of inertia. Though vision struggles on faltering eyes, I hear wind whistle in my ears and feel sun kiss my bone-dry lips.
Sprawled skyward, sharp smudges of sage slide past my sight at such a swift speed I struggle to discern them&mdash;until the smell of cedar sifts into my nostrils, and I realize I&apos;m outside for the first time in forever. Snowflakes slide past at blistering speed though they never touch my clothes or skin. The scalding heat evaporates anything before it can touch me.
Something supports my back and legs. And when I blink my eyes and turn my head to try and reason the sickly figure, just beyond my vision, I feel the texture of obsidian scales abrade my bare neck. They take extra care in carrying me as softly as they can, dampening out the ruggedness of the open road I realize is the railroad tracks.
I expect the pain to return once my awareness peaks, from my broken arm, the Chymaeran curse, and all the wounds I&apos;ve suffered in this worldline everywhere in-between, but it never comes. I dare to hinge my right arm and flex my fingers, and I&apos;m surprised when I feel them fully respond. 
My voice won&apos;t vibrate my vocal cords any louder than the blistering winds. I have no power to shout or yell. I trust nothing, and when I realize the breadth of unaccounted time I&apos;ve lost, I struggle my body in the Chymaeran&apos;s arms. We move so fast the fall would kill me in an instant. It&apos;s all I can count on to get back there. She knew I&apos;d win through persistence. She&apos;s taking me out here to abandon me in the middle of nowhere so that the thread&apos;s horizon eclipses our last confrontation!
She took the trowel before I could disembowel myself, and she pinned me to the ground, inflicting me with the curse so that my conscious soul was imprisoned in my body.
I try to struggle, but her grasp is so strong, refusing any motion of my shoulders and legs, and for the first time in all of this I feel absolutely hopeless.
I&apos;ll beg and plead to this unfeeling, genocidal monster if it offers me the sliver of a chance. That purpose, that unlikely vision I held to that pulled me through everything is just smoke, and I was damned from the start, throwing away everything I could have had for a sunken cost. And I regret everything I&apos;ve ever done. I loathe myself for that persistence. I&apos;ll kill myself a thousand times just for spite, just to suffer the pain I deserve for failing everyone I love, leaving them in that frame forever.
All I give will ever return nothing. I can never be enough.
&quot;Please,&quot; I grumble as loud as I can, but it&apos;s like talking with a mouthful of water. &quot;Please, just leave me to die, Mask, I beg you, please!&quot;
I shed the same pathetic tears I&apos;ve held since I razed my childhood home. I don&apos;t deserve to feel their catharsis though I know I&apos;ve failed, and the more my heart breaks over all the terrible things I&apos;ve done, the more I resign myself to whatever eternal struggle awaits.
&quot;Please,&quot; I still say, no longer struggling against this immovable force of artificial nature I was stupid enough to challenge. &quot;Please, just do one thing, if anything. Take me back to the First Red where I can spend my last eternity paying my respects.&quot;
The Mask doesn&apos;t respond, but acknowledges my final wish. I&apos;ll leave myself the endless cycle of living and dying, in a place where I can forever reflect on the weight of my betrayals&mdash;and that meaningless &apos;edge&apos; I valued more than anything. There is nothing left in Blackwater anyways, and I made sure of it in my last moments in the Backwoods."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Revelation","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Six","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Thirty-Eight","ActNum":4,"ChapterPart":6,"ChapterFull":38,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":122,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"118","Synopsis":"A vicious enemy unmasks themselves.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"4.38","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

Only meager days span the time between when I left and when I returned, but I recognize nothing. Sheets of ice cover every trail and tuft of grasses, returning this impossible bubble into the barren wastes of eternal winter.
The Mask sets me down on the stage of the empty amphitheater. Wherever she walks turns planes of ice into bare patches of grass in an instant, and as her influence expands, the bodies of dead Carmine emerge from cocoons of snow, still perfectly preserved.
&quot;There&apos;s nothing for you in Blackwater. I destroyed it. Your handler Ullrich is dead, along with everyone: all the citizens, and the Afterlife, and the Cadets, and the Carmine, and the Merlot, and all my friends and family,&quot; I say, trying for a last appeal.  &quot;It&apos;s all Dead Essence!&quot;
She just stands there, motionless like a black wax idol, and I bow my head as I sit on the edge of the stage.
&quot;You&apos;ve ruined everything! I can go back, and I can fix all of it. I&apos;m Gods-damn worthless without the chance. You stupid brute, you ruined all of it, everything our people could have had, that I would have brought them. You just like to watch me suffer, huh? Is that what it is, you bitch? Is this amusing to you? Then why didn&apos;t you just&mdash;&quot;
I feel the softness of the human parts of her when she embraces me. I&apos;m surprised when I feel her breath pulse from her lungs in deep, rasping breaths, and finally, I&apos;m awestruck when her weary, heartbreaking wail reverberates across the amphitheater walls. I still refuse my arms around her though I cry harder. I have no empathy for those that try to massacre their own kind in thoughtless violence, but when that first name leaves her lips, I realize the persistence of something I&apos;d missed the whole time.
&quot;Tie,&quot; she says.
The awe fills every space I left for tears. I stand to hug her, reaching my scrawny arms to wrap her in the tightest squeeze I can.
I clutch the back of her head softly and bury my face in her shoulder, and when the shock leaves I feel the sadness return again, allowing it all to flow through me until every ounce I can spend is gone.
&quot;Three nights. But for me it was nineteen years. As soon as they took me I was flooded with Pure Essence, and ever since, all I could feel was this hunger, ever-present, never leaving.&quot;
&quot;You cured me then, outside the train car,&quot; I say.
&quot;I knew you would save me, that you&apos;d never give up on me. I held to this moment, wishing so strongly it would come. I planned for ages, acting the roles, telling myself it would arrive, and that wish came true,&quot; she says, grasping me tighter, pulling me in so strongly that it almost hurts.
But all my self-loathing anger has been traded for sorrowful guilt.
&quot;I should have never taken my eyes off of you. I don&apos;t deserve this. Not when I allowed you to be taken so foolishly, to have you suffer like that. You should hate me more than ever!&quot;
&quot;How could I hate you?&quot;
&quot;Because I ruined everything you could have had,&quot; I tell her. &quot;I should have let you go, but I was selfish, Gods damn-it, how much I wanted to love you for everything I never had, to give you the world. But all I ever did was make you suffer.&quot;
She pushes me away, grasping me by my shoulders. She meets my eyes at arms&apos; length with her amethyst glare.
&quot;I was wrong, Tie. I was a na ve child that understood nothing of all the hurt you saved me from. You gave more than everything you had to me.&quot;
&quot;It wasn&apos;t everything if it wasn&apos;t enough.&quot;
&quot;Are you that blind to yourself and everything you&apos;ve done?&quot; She asks. &quot;Do you know how amazing you are? Because of all those years I spent in education and training&mdash;in every moment I wasn&apos;t groomed to lead the armies of the Afterlife, every quiet moment&mdash;all I could think of was all the goodness you shared with me. How you absorbed every punch of my small fists and hurtful words. How you turned all of that into kindness, no matter how hurt, and lonely, and sad, it must have made you feel.&quot;
I bow my head, but I just can&apos;t grasp it. &quot;There&apos;s still so much I have to do before I can ever rest,&quot; I tell her. &quot;And somehow you&apos;ve found out exactly what that is. I still have to&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Just rest, Tie.&quot; I feel the Amethyst flow from her fingertips, but it&apos;s not the curse. I feel all the muscles in my body relax when I crumple in to her. &quot;You must be so exhausted. By the Gods, Tie, all you need is to rest.&quot;
&quot;But I&apos;m losing time, Ellie. Every second that passes pulls me further away from . . . from . . .&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; she says. My tongue feels so heavy in my mouth. &quot;And I have a plan. I love you more than life itself, more than anything,&quot; she says. &quot;You&apos;re not going back until you&apos;ve prepared, and I swear I&apos;ll fiercely defend you until that day comes.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m your older brother,&quot; I slur. &quot;You&apos;re my treasure to protect.&quot;
&quot;Not anymore,&quot; she says, as she lifts me on her shoulders. &quot;My younger brother&apos;s given enough for a thousand lifetimes. You&apos;re a hero, Tie. Now, please &mdash; let someone else cherish you.&quot;

When fear is stronger than hunger, you often forget to have an appetite. For more than half a year I ate so little, focused on each passing moment, attentive to any chance that might arise to return home to the past.
Ellie&apos;s glad I&apos;m hungry. She found the hunters&apos; meat still frozen in the icebox while I sprawled on one of the cots in the hunters&apos; lodge. If it weren&apos;t for the leverage of her Chymaeran Curse I would have helped her, but she refuses, forcing me to hang there without a muscle to move.
&quot;And you&apos;re gonna stay there until you give in and let me care for you,&quot; she says.
&quot;This is an equal relationship,&quot; I offer.
&quot;No. It&apos;s not. Dad&apos;s not around, and I&apos;m the oldest,&quot; she says. I try to fight it, but my struggle is useless, helplessly watching as she grills a whole spit roast without even lifting a finger. The succulent smell waters my dry mouth when I imagine the taste of meat, and my stomach rumbles, so starved of real food I can&apos;t even remember what it tastes like.
&quot;Let me do <em>something</em>,&quot; I insist.
&quot;Sure. How about you lay there, and wait a little while longer until I&apos;m done? Remember what I said? Relax. You&apos;re not doing or thinking about anything for a while.&quot;
&quot;The Afterlife&mdash;&quot;
&quot;&mdash;Can&apos;t do anything, Titus. Do you even understand the extent of my power?&quot;
&quot;They&apos;re probably watching us right now,&quot; I say, and that memory is creeping back into me. I held it all off for so long by running forward. I forgot that everything would consume me alive if I ever stopped to rest.
The smoke. Just like the smoke of Blackwater at the end of everything; of burning flesh in the storehouse; of the scalding heat of the bootlegger&apos;s hatch beneath a room just like this waiting for ambush, and people just standing there like idiots, like she is, so completely unaware of&mdash;
&quot;Hey! Hey, look at me,&quot; she says, sitting right in front of me on her knees. &quot;Please.&quot;
My eyes are restless. I sweat and choke. My face runs with tears and I&apos;m breathing hard, clutching my chest, sure my heart will explode like Valentina&apos;s skull, my lungs will crush like her body under all the&mdash;
&quot;They&apos;re out there, Ellie. They&apos;re watching everything!&quot;
&quot;Titus.&quot; She cries every time I lose it.
&quot;They&apos;re going to kill us all over again, don&apos;t you get it?&quot;
&quot;Titus, please, look at me!&quot; She begs, hugging me now, tighter and tighter, as if it could ever banish the curse of memory.
&quot;I can&apos;t lose you again. I&apos;m so scared, it&apos;s so dark out there, and I can&apos;t see anything!&quot; I cry.
&quot;I know, Tie, I know,&quot; she says. She puts her head to my chest, listening to how fast my heart beats. &quot;You&apos;re healing. You&apos;re facing everything you&apos;ve buried all at once, but you have to hang in there.&quot;
&quot;I love you, Ellie,&quot; I cry. &quot;I love you so gods-damn much, that&apos;s why I&apos;m so scared.&quot;
&quot;I love you too, but please, just eat something, okay? I&apos;ll watch outside the whole time.&quot;
&quot;Let me by the window,&quot; I say. &quot;Let me see what&apos;s out there.&quot;
&quot;You can sit there when you eat,&quot; she says.
&quot;I&apos;m not letting this happen again. Gods . . .  Romin, Valentina, the fucking smell, like...&quot;
&quot;I know, I know. I&apos;ll cook outside from now on. I&apos;m sorry,&quot; she says.
&quot;It&apos;s alright. <em>I</em>&apos;<em>m</em> sorry, you&apos;re doing so much for me, and I&apos;m just&mdash;&quot;
&quot;You will. And in fact, I&apos;ll prove my power to you. Like you always taught me, I&apos;ll put actions to my words. Then you&apos;ll believe me, and maybe then we can make it through a whole night.&quot;
&quot;Of course,&quot; I say.
&quot;Now just breathe,&quot; she says, and her amethyst touch relaxes me even further. 
I close my eyes and draw shivering, deep breaths, gasping between sobs as I bury my face in my hands, running out of tears to cry when I&apos;ve drank so little since we got here. 
&quot;That&apos;s it. You&apos;re doing great. Now are you ready to eat?&quot;
&quot;I think so. I&apos;m getting better. I just need time,&quot; I say, just to persuade myself, but she nods her head, a smile parting her lips as she helps me get up.
She releases the restful curse, and the full motion of my body returns. 
I walk to the table instead of the window.
&quot;Are you sure?&quot;
&quot;I won&apos;t get better unless I can deal with it,&quot; I say. I scarf the plate down in seconds, nearly choking before I guzzle water. She fills my plate again, and I eat slower this time, savoring the fine cuts that Ellie smoked to perfection.
She sits next to me, indulging in the tastes of her own cooking. &quot;It&apos;s not as good as you ever made it, but I hope it&apos;s close,&quot; she says.
&quot;The Essence adds flavor,&quot; I joke, and her face lights up when I&apos;m back again. &quot;Don&apos;t drown it on mulling spices like Mom did. Or douse it in steak sauce like Clint, saying it&apos;s &apos;too damn tough to eat.&apos; But really. This is wonderful.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m glad you like it,&quot; she says. &quot;Do you want another?&quot;
&quot;No, I&apos;ll choke.&quot;
We share a laugh.

I return to the cot after supper, and we spend two hours reminiscing on our earliest childhood. I&apos;m not the only one that needs to heal&mdash;right now she&apos;s just slightly less wounded than I am.
Ellie won&apos;t tell me what the plan is, but I want to trust her. And I want to get stronger so I can care for her again, spoiling her with my cooking she missed for so long, filling her with all the compassion I couldn&apos;t give in the unimaginable breadth of time we were apart. There&apos;s still the darkness I find in her eyes when she thinks I&apos;m not watching: losing herself in some unrecognizable cycle of thought and action.
I find light sleep in the cot, tossing and turning, still convinced I sleep on Victory Row, that this day is unlike any of the others. But the air is warm, unlike the unfeeling grey cobblestone walls that absorbed all the heat of the toil below &mdash; and at some point, I find a solace, drifting away into memories of a distant past before any of this, as if the innocence before graduation that we shared could last forever.
I awake to softness on my cheek, no longer swinging in a hammock of twisted fibers. My face is wet. In all my exhaustion, I passed out entirely, drooling on the soft silken surface I slept on.
&quot;You passed out so easily once I moved you,&quot; she says. Her hand is on my back, and she sits on a padded L-shape of rucksack cloth, supported by the wall, resting my head in her lap.
&quot;Do you sleep at all?&quot; I ask her.
&quot;No. I was too busy watching you&mdash;Gods know how many more times I&apos;ll get this chance again. I think I understand how you felt all those nights you stayed.&quot;
&quot;You have to sleep, Ellie,&quot; I tell her, raising my head as I wipe a string of snot before she notices. &quot;Just try, please.&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; she insists.
&quot;And when you wake, I&apos;ll have a meal ready for you. Just like before.&quot;
&quot;I would love that,&quot; she says.
&quot;Then it&apos;s settled.&quot; 
I sit next to her, and soon I realize if it wasn&apos;t for her words, I couldn&apos;t recognize anything about her. She&apos;s an adult like me now, but it&apos;s more than that&mdash;the empty stare she settles on by default when staring out the window and using a knife in the kitchen, cold and unfeeling, only to turn around with a warm smile when she finds I&apos;m watching. I wonder what really kept her going: I know I&apos;m not important enough to bring anyone, let alone my sister, to endure nineteen years of brutal programming.
But it&apos;s been nice, at least. Moments earlier I have given up everything. I can almost feel myself begin to relax when I approach the kitchen, considering what I can make her. Several vegetables are scattered about the icebox, ripe from rapid growth in Essenced harvest. 
I can&apos;t remember the last time I had a chance to cook with these. It was always a treat. I withdraw several potatoes and carrots as I plot out some side dish to go with the leftovers.
I turn around to find Ellie either sleeping, or pretending to sleep, on the rucksack ottoman, her silver flaxen hair tangled in the coarse fibers. I feel something lighten in me from the last time I witnessed this. Is this what happens when a caregiver realizes their child is strong enough to stand on their own? Or&mdash;
The kitchen glass shatters. Something explodes the ceramic pot on the far shelf before burying itself in the trunk of the log wall. My cheek runs warm when the window glass splinters in the air, and all that fear returns to me, melting every trace of peace and trust.
I turn my head before the fractals can blind me. My knees hit the ground before the glass can scratch them. Beneath the table, I see the Ellie I can&apos;t recognize wake in an instant, dissolving from human flesh into Chymaeran form, surpassing the height of the tallest cross-beams before breaking out of the log wall.
I can&apos;t leave her alone out there when I can only imagine the entire force of the Afterlife waits to reclaim their corrupted asset. I remember all the ones I allowed to sacrifice themselves, and I refuse to let the one I cherish to waste herself on me.
The cold air siphons through the vacant hole. That fear of death churns my stomach as I grab a shotgun from the wall, but I&apos;ll hold it down for her. She can&apos;t do anything without me. I am her strength, and I need to prove my self worth as her brother: or else she&apos;ll supersede me and forget.
I put on a First Red cloak and boots as gunshots ring out from all sides. They&apos;ve been surrounding us the whole time, waiting for a vulnerable moment, and I was right. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s all of them, every single one that survived, just waiting for that perfect chance to kill the reason she left.
Swaths of amethyst flames flicker the log walls with brilliant light, and I can hear explosions crackle in the night air. I kick open the door to face the enemy, ready to die for her again as many times as it takes.
But I&apos;m halted when I exit: there&apos;s a membrane of pearlescent energy cloaking the cabin, casting everything beyond it in a haze like looking through marbled glass. 
The adversaries of the Afterlife target me with their repeating rifles, but all their bullets dissolve to dust when they slam against the barrier, coughing smoke and sparks of steel into my face. I turn left to find Ellie standing there in her full Chymaeran form. She&apos;s been waiting so that she could fulfill her promise in proving herself to me, and I realize the only chance the Afterlife ever had was a surprise attack.
All she needed was for me to watch her. And as I stand there, dropping the weapon from my hands, the two-story terror casts white-hot flames across the landscape, burning all the First Red cabins to ash in a single sweep.
They try to retreat, but they&apos;re too late. To Ellie, it&apos;s personal now, and within her range of influence, she clenches her fist and they crumble to Endogenous tar.
The air is silent. Fresh Essence floats in the air when the clumps of Endogeny dry over and crackle, and Ellie diverts it into me, flooding my circuits with unimaginable energy. I feel the slice on my face soften over, and I realize that this is the true power of Essence the Afterlife would raze their own kind for.
Two minutes was all it took. And when the barrier dissolves, I can finally survey the landscape.
Heading east towards the Chieftains&apos; Lodge, I count at least forty full-Essenced Royal Guardsmen reduced to ash. She follows somewhere behind me, standing watch as a roving tower. Every moment, I expect a survivor to emerge from the rubble, but once I truly witness the scale of tremendous destruction, I realize how powerless I am compared to her.
The moonlight eclipses when she stands above me. It was only two minutes. I can&apos;t even imagine the full extent of her power as the Mask if she was forced to try. I look up to find her slender, Obsidian limbs blending ceaselessly with the dark sky, so far removed from the smoke and light of civilization that both moons and all the stars are fully visible, including the blue spec Oceanus and its satellite.
I feel a strange warmth in this helplessness, and when she decides our small encampment is safe, she returns to human form. The smell of ozone and burning rubber saturates the air as her great form erodes away, leaving the flaxen-haired girl of silken cloth standing right behind me.
&quot;I believe you now,&quot; I admit. &quot;Gods&mdash;I thought you needed me. But you could take on the whole world like that.&quot;
&quot;I do need you. You&apos;re my purpose. You&apos;re the treasure I have to protect and cherish, until our time here is up,&quot; she says.
&quot;But why? What am I worth if I can&apos;t give anything to protect or help you? It&apos;s so uncomfortable, this . . . helplessness,&quot; I say. It&apos;s an unfamiliar feeling: that despite the thread and all my potential, there is a wall.
&quot;You don&apos;t have to do anything right now. All you need to do is accept my protection, and trust me when I say you are completely safe under my care,&quot; Ellie says. She embraces me as I watch the sky. &quot;You&apos;ve spent your entire life giving all without expecting anything in return. So cherish this moment. Recover as you prepare for the final battle that lies ahead. That relentlessness is the most important thing you have to give: both to me, and to all those people you miss in another lifetime. From this frayed end of reality, I will give you all the strength you need to return. It is not your hardness, but your vulnerability, that will lead you to victory.&quot;"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":84,"ActNum":4,"ChapterPart":7,"ChapterFull":39,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":84,"Index":127,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"123","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Time skip.

I have my limits, but that does not make me weak. I am as small as a speck of sand on the shores of Blackwater lake, but I still remain the furthest from nothing. I cannot change the world in it&apos;s entirety. My reach is small, and my influence in the affairs of this world is limited. 
So I choose my focus wisely when I prepare to return to that future past.
Ellie slept next to me for the first two weeks until the nightmares subsided and I stopped trembling. She still insists on it every night, from how many countless years she spent dreaming of this moment. 
I ate well, and even better when I built the strength to start hunting, using the sharp obsidian arrows she synthesizes from Chymaeran scales. Every day I get one percent stronger, smarter, and more vulnerable to her kindness. She tells me I need to practice, and so she trains me, spending entire days practicing everything she can remember.
I still stay away from the Chieftains&apos; Lodge. I can&apos;t bring the courage to return there yet &mdash; knowing she lays there with all the people who ever trusted me before that fated end. We quarter ourselves in the barracks on the edge of the Backwoods, living on little, because there is nothing I can take back beyond a plan and a lighter soul.
She instructs me to drop the sword and rifle and take up my fists. She transfers her boundless Essence in short episodes. In two weeks, I can hardly sustain a steady flame in the palm of my hand, but she&apos;s so excited, praising me at every advancement, reminding me of how much they made her suffer just to learn that.
But she still refuses to tell me the plan. At first she would just change the subject, but as my curiosity runs deeper and deeper, she says I need to be stronger to accept what I have to do.
&quot;All I can tell you is that your target is in the Afterlife, and it&apos;s a significant task you can&apos;t hope to ever do alone,&quot; she finally says, refusing to tell me until the last moments we share.
I&apos;m building muscle. I&apos;m not as strong as I was, but when I practice in combat, I&apos;ve almost been able to take her down.
I write everything I can remember until I feel I&apos;ve planned every contingency, every detail, and when she describes all she knows of the city above the smoke, I can visualize the last moments I&apos;ll spend there.
It&apos;s been at least a month-and-a-half since I discovered her in the amphitheater.
&quot;I think I&apos;m ready,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot;
&quot;Without a doubt. I&apos;m ready to talk to her.&quot;
She embraces me tenderly. My sister has protected me all this time, giving me everything I could ever ask for, teaching me the lessons I needed to grow just a little more.
We walk out the door together, and the weather is just as warm as when the First Red called it home. The bodies of the dead no longer taint the air, and it&apos;s been so long since Ellie dissolved them to endogenous ash that they returned to the earth. If the ground accepts them &mdash; and nature can cycle on without hesitation &mdash; I know I can come to terms with this. It&apos;s a patch of frozen ice just like I left it. We&apos;ve been staying away from it this whole time, and now that Ellie and I approach the Lodge, the evidence of that past reveals itself.
I will grieve and mourn. There are sacrifices I will have to make, and terrible dilemmas whose outcomes I will have to accept. I will lose the ones closest to me &mdash; and if I can&apos;t accept that &mdash; I will forever be trapped in this endless cycle.
I return to the porch of the Chieftains&apos; Lodge to dwell in that last glimpse, and as the bodies of that cataclysmic reckoning emerge from the thawed ice, I remember everything.

I close my eyes and I can hear the voice that woke the whole village. In my hand, I can still feel that celestial pebble of divine power resonating my circuits, waiting for the contact of blood to reap their comeuppance.
All the evidence of that last struggle exists before me, halted in time &mdash; and though more than half a year has passed for me, for them, it&apos;s only been a mere month &mdash; or even less, from how perfectly the frost preserved them. When the deed was done, they dragged me off to the only windowless room in the village before I could bear witness to the Afterlife&apos;s carnage, before I could reap the collateral Essence. They locked me in the nearest shed, tying me up with rope and gagging me with my own mark, leaving me for hours until I heard the sounds of combat and then absolute silence.
I never got to see any of the ones I left to die. By the time the Royal Guard bludgeoned the lock and dragged me by my legs, the first flakes had already begun to fall.
I stand on that porch, and when I close my eyes, I can hear her shout as loud as she can, her voice still tinged with that wavering cowardice that followed her for her whole life: afraid to lose everything; bound by blood and allegiance to nothing; drowning in the same self-hatred I held for so long.
Her incessant shouting infuriates me. After everything I&apos;ve given, I&apos;m insulted that she could think I was throwing it all away; that in any way this could matter; that the entire population wasn&apos;t damned from that moment the Afterlife got their means to our end.
And when I close my eyes, I can still feel it, that biting loneliness and sadness that liquefies to incendiary anger under the right pressure. The breaking of that dam &mdash; or the fall from that ledge &mdash; the last sense of humanity withheld before the sanctity of the mission. I knew how the Gods felt when they watched the pettiness of mortal affairs, because in that moment, I had no room left for the pruned ghosts of this dying timeline.
She told me she loved me right before I did it. But I denied her. I said the only thing she really loved of me was just the image of what I could give her and nothing more, but I didn&apos;t know I could ever feel the way I do now.
That doesn&apos;t matter, though. I know her love would have changed nothing. It was my own love for this world and the desire to save everything that drove me there, after all. 
And so the Pure Essence flooded my veins for the second time. The beacon erupted in a bright flash of pearlescent light, stretching all the way from the divine realm to the mortal world. I understood the reason for that column of light now: with no Mask to flood Essence into, rejected by my thread, the celestial pebble jettisoned all its potential energy into the atmosphere.
I saw flashes of another life when my soul tried to bind to that divine realm, but the thread obscured so much of it. All I could see was the vision of a young girl threading that first line to tether herself to me, dragging me at the wrist in a rush to jump before anything could stop us.
The First Red panicked at how I overturned their vote, but still refused to come near me. The fight was coming to them, and suddenly that fear of the darkness &mdash; nestled in trees and settled behind snowbanks &mdash; overwhelmed them as they hastily prepared their defenses.
At some point Sylvia tried to separate me. She leveraged her height to pull me from the flux of that column, and when I hardly gave, she fought instead to wrestle the Pure Essence from my hands.
She had no idea of what was begging to be released from inside of her. I fought even harder to resist when I considered the Goddess stranding me here with nothing. I lusted for the life of every breathing thing around me as much as she longed for any kind of life that I was with her.
She resorted to pleading when her brawn was no match. 
&quot;Just let go, Titus, yield!&quot;
&quot;I can&apos;t let you ruin this,&quot; I told her. My grip tightened further. I couldn&apos;t let her touch any part of it or else that celestial side would come out and turn everything to lava and ash.
&quot;You&apos;re killing everyone! When will you ever be satisfied? When will this ever end?&quot;
&quot;When I fix everything, Sylvia, this is all I live for. I can fix everything. I can fix you!&quot;
I felt  her grip loosen and I thought I&apos;d won. But then Raine shoulder-charged me, and I flew backwards, releasing the remnants of the Pure Essence across the stage as our combined weight crunched the planks of the porch.
&quot;I&apos;m not broken. I was never broken, Titus. I own every single part of me, because it&apos;s brought me to who I am.&quot;
She reaches for it.
&quot;Stop, Sylvia!&quot;
&quot;And if you can&apos;t accept yourself for what&apos;s made you, then, then . . .&quot;
All she did was raise her hand. She didn&apos;t even have to touch it. When the pebble of divine Essence made contact with her skin, the shockwave knocked all the bustling First Red to their knees, blasting trees to bend like blades of grass in a windstorm.
That earlier reaction to Raine&apos;s Essence was only the slightest preview of what it could do to her. Saturated with radiant celestial light, I watched as every shred of Sylvia dissolved away. She floated into the air, above Raine and I as we reclined in the recess between cross-beams. Her hair became silver like Ellie&apos;s, skin patterned with runes and symbols of a long-forgotten age, her tattered clothes replaced with billowing garments that could only be synthesized by divine tailors.
I found Lyra in the crowd, on her knees along with all the others, either too dumbfounded to move or forced to prostration. They all looked upon the face of divinity with reverence while all of Blackwater worshipped false idols, so they were overwhelmingly aware of their sins of fear and avarice, like children brought before the source of their shame.
The daughter of the Goddess&apos; voice boomed with thunder. &quot;I needn&apos;t explain to you the shame behind your fear, because the thread-barer has brought before you the judgment you so clearly deserve. Removed from your homeland to toil here, under the pretense of courage and emancipation, you soil the name and purpose of your Carmine, and leave your own brothers and sisters to die alone! You will &mdash; ugh...&quot;
The Goddess grasped her head.
&quot;Enough, you&apos;ve taken over for years! Saying that you&apos;re the real one? Weak and pathetic as &mdash;&quot;
The First Red watched in confusion, unsure whether to grovel and beg for their worthless lives as the Goddess toiled with the other side of her. This wasn&apos;t anything like the Afterlife. That side was weaker now, I could tell in an instant she knew how little time she had in that form. 
She descended to the ground. The dark locks of Sylvia&apos;s hair pulsed back in color. 
&quot;I refuse,&quot; she said. &quot;We&apos;re not doing that. Not now, not ever!&quot;
But she turns again. &quot;You pathetic bitch, has this taste of mortality made you this soft?&quot;
The First Red looked on in horror as the Goddess turned to me. She tensioned her fingers around my collar and lifted me into the air.
&quot;You were the one that brought me here. You swindled me. I longed for freedom from the divine realm so much, you used me to come back from the dead!&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t remember anything,&quot; I told her.
&quot;You were trying to save your sister. Just like your father, you told yourself you&apos;d do whatever it took to go back there, all the way, even if it meant you&apos;d die forever. You told me. The house, the little girl, and the Snowdrifters that ravaged everything. You made a pact with me. I would bring you back, and you&apos;d bring me with you. You promised a beautiful world, but all I found was &mdash;&quot;
She faltered again, dropping me to the ground.
&quot;Suffering. I found suffering, and that&apos;s all you thought it was,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;I remember all of it! What did we long for? We longed for the joy of a full experience, the one thing mortals could find that made the Gods jealous. The bounds of time create purpose. And when we longed for a taste of that, did you really think all we&apos;d find was joy and peace?&quot;
She paused for a moment to receive the internal monologue. I found myself next to Lyra who already connected the pieces, unsure of how to react as I struggled myself to accept this revelation.
&quot;You bound yourself with the threads to create me. You made sure you&apos;d forget so you&apos;d feel the thrills of mortality,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;We were the ones that used him, knowing he might never return there. It was a chance for us as much as it was a mission for him.&quot;
She turned again. 
&quot;We were supposed to fix the failure of Khiras and her experiment. The end was meant to be different, and if you can&apos;t see that &mdash; I&apos;ll make sure that no mortal will ever suffer the end of this timeline!&quot;
The Goddess rose into the air, still fighting herself, a young spirit and an exhausted immortal forever unwilling to coalesce.
&quot;You fail again, thread-barer. This is the end of another&mdash;&quot;
Sylvia resists. The winds pick up all around us as the ground shakes; distant tremblings of a familiar end I remember from a past life. I couldn&apos;t let the Goddess unwittingly trap me here.
&quot;You have to resist, Sylvia, please!&quot; I shouted. &quot;I have to go back. I have to save all of us, to make things right. The mission. Whatever that was. I have to finish the fight!&quot;
Just then, a distant flash lit the sky that only I could ever recognize.
&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Titus. I&apos;m sorry I dragged you into all of this. I&apos;ve only ever been sincere to you, in all that time we were blind to that truth of where we came from. But my love for you is &mdash;&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; I told her.
&quot;We loved each other in the Reservoir, and yet . . . even with our memories lost, we still found that lost piece.&quot;
&quot;I just wish I could remember. Anything.&quot;
She descended in her heavenly raiments on the last pulse of Pure Essence, dissolving, reaching for one last kiss before she was withdrawn from the mortal plane. I turned my head up to her as she approached, but when three minutes passed since the flash lit the sky, the wall of pressure disintegrated her body to shimmering dust.
I fell to my knees. The First Red remobilized when they remembered the closeness of their last trial, as if nothing had ever happened.
&quot;You were him all along,&quot; Lyra said. &quot;You don&apos;t remember anything. The house. Father. The passing of the Mask to you. I knew it as soon as I saw that column of light. You&apos;re . . . Fletcher . . .&quot; She looked halfway torn between embracing me and outright killing me, but before she could react, Raine brandished me across the face with his fist.
&quot;You Gods-damn bastard!&quot; He shouted.
&quot;Raine, stop it!&quot; Lyra pleaded.
&quot;He&apos;s getting thrown the only place he deserves to rot. Away from everything, and away from the Essence he longs to pilfer from our corpses.&quot;
&quot;Stop it, just give us a moment!&quot; Lyra says, but like his son, his mind is immovable. Two more Carmine join to drag me off the streets towards the windowless shed as Lyra falls behind.
And now, I stand here on this porch, opening my eyes to recall every minute of the events as they unfolded. I finally see the aftermath I missed when the Royal Guard dragged me from that shed. Lyra died five steps away from the crater in the floorboards. Raine died just past the shed. And when I notice Lyra&apos;s hand missing the ring finger, I draw a long, shallow breath before I anticipate her to speak to me again through death.
Her hand falls on my shoulder, and I shiver at her cold touch."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":86,"ActNum":4,"ChapterPart":8,"ChapterFull":40,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":86,"Index":130,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"126","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Titus agrees to stay a while longer until they both heal.","VerboseID":"4.40.86","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"OCJG","Body":"
&quot;It&apos;s something you think about when you&apos;re surrounded by Chymaerans all the time. It&apos;s the soul that&apos;s the question. Do we identify with the body as our identity? Or is the body just a vehicle for the soul?&quot;
We look at her body as we sit on the steps of the porch, but she isn&apos;t dismayed or terrified. Instead, she&apos;s almost curious.
&quot;It&apos;s funny. You think I&apos;d be a lot more worked up about this, confronted with my own death. I remember it so clearly when the Royal Guard overwhelmed us, that last moment when my defenses slipped and I gave in. But in the end, I guess I got what I wanted.&quot;
&quot;Did it hurt?&quot; I ask her.
&quot;I don&apos;t remember, there was so much adrenaline. Just a long tunnel of light, then oblivion, and the next moment I&apos;m here.&quot;  She turns to me with Ellie&apos;s amethyst eyes. &quot;Reminds me of a joke I heard. &apos;I don&apos;t mind dying. I just don&apos;t want to be around when it happens,&apos;&quot; Lyra says. 
&quot;What do you remember? I saw nothing. I only heard the horrors of what was happening until everything went silent.&quot;
&quot;In those last moments I thought of everything I still wanted to say to you. It&apos;s been a checklist in my mind forever &mdash; and even more so since that first column of light proved he was alive. But I realized there wasn&apos;t much else I really had to do. I was with you: for as short as it was, as close as I got to killing you at times, it all still felt like more than I could ask for.&quot;
&quot;And I&apos;m going to make it better next time,&quot; I tell her. &quot;I promise you. Everything you&apos;ve ever dreamed of. Say&mdash;what is it that you wanted to hear the most from Fletcher? From . . . me?&quot;
&quot;That you&apos;re proud,&quot; she says, without hesitation. &quot;Telling me that I lived up to everything you left behind, that I squandered none of that potential you wast&mdash; er, &apos;spent,&apos; on saving me.&quot;
&quot;You lived a wonderful life of service,&quot; I tell her. &quot;You gave yourself to a cause, and you were faithful to the end. I took that chance at life from you before you could see the fruits of that dedication. I was selfish because I had a different mission. I knew that all of Blackwater and everyone around it would be swallowed into the earth, met with a violent, sudden fate, and because of that, I had to do whatever it took to go back there. And regardless of that, I&apos;m sorry I betrayed you and everyone you care for. I hope that you can forgive me, even in death.&quot;
&quot;I do, Fletcher &mdash; if I can call you that. I fully understand your reason. It wasn&apos;t you. You were as married to your purpose as I was to my own, and it was even grander than mine, so believe me when I say it&apos;s only the First Red that need to redeem themselves. You gave them a chance to react to this and put your faith in them.&quot;
&quot;Everything will change next time,&quot; I insist. I have the workings of my plan that I&apos;ve pieced together for the past month, filling all the imaginary holes and threading all the pieces.
But a question still lingers.
&quot;Say. How is it that you remember so much as a guise?&quot;
&quot;A . . . guise? What do you &mdash; you mean I&apos;m. . .&quot;
Her hands feel for every contour of her body. I&apos;m frightened for a moment as I watch her panic, then I remember what we&apos;ve been staring at this whole time.
I laugh. 
&quot;Very funny. But really.&quot;
&quot;It all depends on the connection,&quot; she says. &quot;Your friends Romin and Valentina died horrible, gruesome deaths, and I bet that made them far less-willing to surrender themselves to complete strangers. You feel that other consciousness intrude on your existence, and at first it&apos;s terrifying, threatening everything that makes you who you were. Ellie tells me that&apos;s why sometimes it takes years, while others can be instant. What it comes down to is compatibility and trust.&quot;
It reminds me of the exact same feeling when I enter my past self. But every time it&apos;s a hostile takeover, like killing a past fragment of myself in their sleep with just own hands: too slow that they soon awake to what&apos;s happening; forced to accept it as their own existence is haplessly erased. 
&quot;You said you were so afraid. So what was it that made you surrender yourself?&quot;
&quot;I gave myself up because I could feel the warmth of it it &mdash; the biggest commonality between both of us: how much we love and cherish that brother that brings himself to suffer and toil for our own well-being, expecting nothing in return. We want you to thrive, even if we know that one day soon you&apos;ll be leaving us both behind here.&quot;
&quot;You will never be dead to me,&quot; I tell them. &quot;I swear it, I&apos;ll carry on every piece of you and wear my pride on my sleeve. I&apos;ll know you still persist here. I&apos;ll dream of us as if sleep can bridge our lifelines. And at the end of it all, I&apos;ll think of you every day from morning until night, until it&apos;s the last thought I ever have, I swear it!&quot;
Lyra&apos;s eyes run wet as the hope in my words grows. Ellie slips out from Lyra&apos;s guise, and the conviction of my words draw a deep, lonely sorrow through her eyes.
&quot;What happened? I&apos;m sorry. Did I say something wrong?&quot;
She makes herself small, curling up just like she used to when I came home late and found her feeling so alone. Because I know I will be leaving her here.
&quot;I can&apos;t tell you yet, not until the end of this . . . but I&apos;ve just been dreading it so much,&quot; Ellie says.
&quot;Then I will listen, whenever you are ready,&quot; I say.
She stretches her slender legs down the steps. &quot;I just wish you could stay here forever, Titus, and regardless of how important I know that mission is to the both of us, it just makes me so sad. I got what I could only dream of for years, and all I can think is what it will feel like when it&apos;s gone!&quot;
She bashes her fists into the planks, and one of them snaps. I reach to comfort her, just like I&apos;ve always done. I remove the arm of my coat and wrap her in the warmth of it, allowing her to bury her head into my shoulder and sob as I extend my arm around her.
&quot;I wish I could give you everything for all you&apos;ve suffered, and all I&apos;ve missed. The reason why it&apos;s so easy to give to you? You give me so much in return and you don&apos;t even realize it,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;ve spent my whole life thinking I&apos;m a burden paying off an ever-increasing debt against all the people I care for. That they keep me around just to collect what I can give. Gods forbid, I was the Valedictorian of the Academy and I still felt lower than dirt &mdash; so entrenched in the mentality I learned in the Orphanage before I was adopted, deserving love. At that young age it might have been hard for you to show it, when I was just another adult telling you how to live.&quot;
&quot;I shouldn&apos;t have been such a jerk,&quot; she sobs.
&quot;You were a child &mdash; but through it all, you accepted and cherished that kindness. And that alone was what was enough to fill my heart and keep me going. And even now, you teach me that lesson through your boundless love.&quot; I begin to cry, but I let it flow out of me, not judging it, letting all the inward pain I collected to harden myself with to melt away. I can feel her now. And as I opened up this past month, I noticed things I had never taken the time to care about before.
&quot;When I was broken down to the lowest point, fully vulnerable for the first time, you were there to protect me &mdash; or else I thought I&apos;d break entirely. You made me feel all the things I&apos;d run from, not allowing me to erect walls and hide. I felt all of it. And because of that, you taught me the greatest lesson of my life: that there is pain that heals.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m not ready to let you go,&quot; she says. I feel her arms tension around me, unaware of how strong she is. &quot;Lyra tested you, and you&apos;re ready, but . . . I just can&apos;t let you go. Stay, just a little bit longer, please, Titus. I&apos;m not better yet,&quot; she says, lapsing into her younger self for a moment.
&quot;Neither one of us is fully healed. We&apos;ve only begun to reverse that momentum.&quot;
&quot;So stay, just a little while longer,&quot; she says.
&quot;I will. And when I return, I&apos;m going to save you. I won&apos;t let you ever suffer again what you endured here.&quot;
&quot;And that&apos;s what I&apos;m afraid of,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m not telling you until the moment you leave me. Or else you&apos;ll never go.&quot;
&quot;I will listen when it&apos;s time. A brother always listens.&quot; She looks up at me with teary eyes to find my face just as wet. &quot;There are so many sacrifices I&apos;ll have to accept. People will die, and so many will suffer. I&apos;m only giving myself one shot in this last loop. But for now, in this short breadth of peace, let&apos;s get stronger together. Spirit is the only thing I can carry.&quot;"},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Atonement","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Nine","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Forty-One","ActNum":4,"ChapterPart":9,"ChapterFull":41,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":131,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"127","Synopsis":"A powerful ally centers Titus in one final effort.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"4.41","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

An uncountable span of solace graces the two of us. Days fade together seamlessly in this severed timeline. She continues to teach me everything she can, and I listen to every word, because I&apos;ve never stopped to really hear her like this before. And maybe I&apos;ve never stopped to hear anyone.
We don&apos;t have to call out the day when it arrives. We can both feel it. The only arguments we&apos;ve had were about how I was going to do it, and even now, we continue to reach an impasse.
&quot;It will be quick either way. But there&apos;s no way I can ask you to do that,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;Aren&apos;t you afraid to die? And to do it to yourself, Titus . . . Gods above, how long has it been?&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s been a long time. And yeah, I guess I am afraid. I haven&apos;t slept easy the last couple nights&mdash;&quot; <em>though the sleep I did get was a hundred times better than when I first got here.</em>
&quot;Then let me do it. Please, it will be merciful, and you won&apos;t have to worry. You won&apos;t feel a thing.&quot;
&quot;I can&apos;t put that on you. You have to live on here, Ellie, and I refuse to let you carry that weight &mdash; I love you too much to know that you&apos;ll suffer. And we won&apos;t be able to forgive ourselves on either side of it.&quot;
&quot;But can you really do it?&quot; She asks. 
&quot;I&apos;ll get over it,&quot; I say. I know she senses that hesitation in my voice, as if I&apos;m asking for her to convince me otherwise, but I just can&apos;t let that come through. &quot;My head hits and I&apos;m done for. Just let me do it alone, I don&apos;t want you to witness this, no matter what horrible things you&apos;ve been through . . .&quot;
&quot;I refuse,&quot; she says. &quot;I still need to tell you that secret &mdash; what you have to do when you&apos;re up there in the Afterlife.&quot;
&quot;You can tell me now, right?&quot;
&quot;You&apos;ll refuse to leave if I tell you. I have to make sure you go back, don&apos;t you remember? You made me swear I&apos;d never let you get too comfortable or refuse your mission.&quot;
&quot;That was so long ago,&quot; I say. &quot;Unbelievable how long we&apos;ve been here. It only feels like yesterday.&quot;
&quot;And you&apos;ve prepared yourself in every possible way you can. I know you&apos;re ready. You know you&apos;re ready.&quot;
Our words are just idle chatter. This is the first time here it&apos;s ever felt like a waste. I think about all she&apos;s done for me, and all I&apos;ve been able to do for her.
&quot;We&apos;ll turn to stone if we hesitate.&quot; <em>Just a little longer,</em> I want to say. I can see she feels the same, and so in that pulse of raw emotion, I concede.
I approach her, pulling her in for the last hug, the last time I&apos;ll feel her grown strength before she&apos;s just a child again, forgetting all of this except the love she&apos;s felt all this time.
&quot;I&apos;ll let you do it,&quot; I tell her.
She begins to weep, and I feel her wet tears fall on my shoulders. I put my hand behind her head and tuck her in tighter, as if all the heat of my body in this moment could keep her warm for the rest of her life here.
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s the last act of love I can give to you.&quot;
It&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve ever thought about what I&apos;m leaving behind. &quot;Where will you bury me? At the old house? Here in the Backwoods?&quot;
&quot;You&apos;ll be ash,&quot; she says. &quot;You might blow away on the winds, too fine to capture a handful, but what&apos;s left is how you touched my soul, and that is forever.&quot;
&quot;Will I see you in the end? When I free myself from this thread &mdash; will we meet again? In the reservoir? Will it join all these realities?&quot;
&quot;Let&apos;s make a promise to wait until we find each other,&quot; she says. &quot;We&apos;ll jump together. We&apos;ll be born again!&quot;
&quot;I promise,&quot; I tell her.
Our time is short. I can feel how much I&apos;m overstaying my welcome when purpose lies on the other side of this thread.
&quot;What is your mission?&quot; She asks.
&quot;To get to the Afterlife,&quot; I say. 
The amethyst begins to surge.
&quot;How will you get there?&quot;
&quot;By rallying my closest allies.&quot;
&quot;What will you pay?&quot; Ellie asks, as I feel myself disintegrate.
&quot;Whatever cost within free will,&quot; I say, as a comfortable warmth fills my body. &quot;Of myself and all the others.&quot;
She sobs. &quot;And to what end will you go?&quot;
&quot;One continuous push,&quot; I say. &quot;Not to die by intention, but only by circumstance!&quot;
&quot;You&apos;re ready, Titus.&quot; The painless dissolution of my body decays my fingers to ash as I try to reach for her one last time. &quot;You have one mission above all: one final act of love and mercy.&quot; Every part of me that remains is lighter than air, floating away as timeless firebrands, off to spark change in another life she&apos;ll never witness.
With all my lingering consciousness focused on the last surviving sense of sight, I read her lips as she speaks: a single demand of two words.

&quot;At the end of the day, and at the end of all of this, friends, we are all just watchmen of the night, taking our shift until we&apos;re relieved of service and get to go home and rest. We might tire as the shift grows long, and at times, it might feel if we&apos;ve done nothing at all but just watch.&quot;
This Titus draws a breath. Surrounded by thousands of faces, celebrated for his relentlessness with the honor to speak encouraging words, he has never felt more alone in his life.
He thinks this is the worst it can get. But he knows nothing of where this current path will take him if he&apos;s undisturbed. His eyes flicker to that space of vacant seats he reserved until the disappointment feels like it will burn his stomach. That friendly shopkeep from Clint&apos;s is the only one that showed up &mdash; he must have sent her here as an errand. He purses his lips and continues on after pausing for effect.
&quot;But we haven&apos;t just watched. We&apos;ve experienced a full and beautiful life,&quot; he says, and he almost loses himself in the irony, but pushes it down just like he does with everything else. &quot;We never asked for this job.

We all understand the value of sacrifice, the beauty of watching our influence carry for generations, and the question we all have here is the same.&quot;
He pauses again. This Titus acts resolute though the question still devastates him. They sit at the edge of their seats, knowing what question awaits, the single burning thought that&apos;s worn into the grooves of their minds since they first heard the phrase Suicide Scholar.
&quot;How, friends, do we live to fight, knowing that most of us are going to die out there?&quot;
The auditorium is silent. Ninety percent of the parents and supporters&apos; children will be sent beyond the walls; only a mere ten percent were good enough to stay. The cadets no longer chatter. It&apos;s so silent that the sound of nature in the Foothills re-emerges as if Endogeny had already extingusished them, so quiet that Titus hears the Grandmaster General Ullrich cough behind him at the podium.
This Titus rides this feeling of anticipation because he loves the satisfaction of absolute control. He can see the desperation resurface in Cadets and supporters alike, but he wants to provide them reassuring words, even if they&apos;re not his.
He opens his mouth to speak, but then the sudden migraine overtakes him.
He grasps his head. He feels such anguish that it almost casts him all the way to the floor. He drops down on one knee, but it feels like another voice is calling to him. The scar on his right arm beneath the ceremonial armor and mark feels like that hard scar tissue is replaced with molten steel, and he feels a lattice of cuts cascade up his arm.
The crowd rises with commotion. Ullrich reaches behind him to grab his shoulder. &quot;Are you alright, son? You were doing so great.&quot;
This Titus groans with pain, but just like they always do, he concedes once he hears my voice is his own, once he sees a glimpse of that inevitable premonition and the whole path he&apos;s destined to suffer to get there.
Just help me. I never, ever, want to witness or feel that horrible future, he pleads me, and I&apos;m merciful when I take over. I can feel all of future Ellie&apos;s Essence funnel into me though that threaded tether
like talking wires, and I know this time I have so much Essence that failure is impossible.
&quot;Titus? Are you alright?&quot; Ullrich asks. &quot;What happened this time?&quot;
If only these people knew what he was responsible for, how much suffering he accustomed them to, generation after generation, goading their habits towards unquestioning acceptance of indentured servitude.
I should strike him down right here, but I can&apos;t.
&quot;I&apos;m fine, sir,&quot; I say.
I grab the podium again with fresh eyes, looking upon the faces of the dead I&apos;ve seen dissolve to ash so many times before &mdash; lives I&apos;ll save that I&apos;ve never met; cadets I&apos;ve killed that know nothing of what lies ahead.
&quot;Why do we fight the inevitable?&quot;
That Titus&apos; answer to his own question is the last remaining piece of him, but it&apos;s not good enough for me anymore. It doesn&apos;t encapsulate the lessons of that unwritten chapter, and when my eyes cross the audience, I find familiar faces that won&apos;t ever know me like I knew them. In the front is that poor Cadet destined to die when he fights me in the train car, calling me a vagrant, and sitting beside him is Zane, the cadet that confided in me at the end of our trials on Victory Row.
To the left are the forty-some cadets that Romin convinced to fight with him beyond the gates. Three of them had their torsos bisected under the weight of the wrought iron. Twelve or more of them were too late. The rest were the ones I saved that gave their lives to protect me, yet they don&apos;t even know what might await them. Towards the back are the two cadets that killed Lyra and I in Victory Row. I remember obliterating the first one&apos;s skull with a rock until his features were indiscernible, and the second one, I stabbed in the chest until I ran out of breath, finding no satiation for that unfathomable rage. But here they sit before me, goofing off and hitting each other with one of the graduation fliers.
And finally, I see the top one percent sitting there before me: the three friends tied to me; our bond stronger than blood; the ones I&apos;ve learned will fight alongside me through death; the three flawed, despairing, lovable, cherished cadets that I&apos;ll give my everything for.
&quot;We live to fight because we were made for higher dreams,&quot; I tell them. &quot;The passion of the fight is what makes the act of living worth anything at all. The capacity to feel; to be hurt; to feel the fury of a thousand suns and the solace of the softest sleep; the experience of the act of life is what we live for.&quot;
The peace of that uncountable breadth of time with my sister washes upon me, and I can feel it again, that feeling I never thought I&apos;d feel, that feeling mythologized by my own obsessive lust for suffering and seclusion.
&quot;So ask yourselves not what the meaning of anything is in times of despair, because you will never get a whole answer. We are not machines like those generators casting that thick, residual haze into the air. Above all of this, somewhere, is a blue sky. The meaning is the experience: not the eventuality of waiting for an unpromised future, but feeling through this moment we live in right now,&quot; I say, and when I see the three sitting in front of me jarred by my shift in demeanor, I thank whatever Gods may be that I get whatever time I have left with them. &quot;This exact moment doesn&apos;t care about the future or the past, so live here with me, friends, and you&apos;ll endure the greatest of life&apos;s challenges. Feel through it, because all that persists from generation to generation is memory, and nothing more.&quot;
I&apos;m surprised when my hands are untensioned against the podium. I feel a wetness reside in my eyes, a newfound feeling, and I wipe it before they notice. It&apos;s not the fear that leads me to tears. It&apos;s the beauty of this moment I once lost when I decided it was a chore, and the joy of that blessing to have finally returned.
The crowd applauds as I turn to descend the stairs, but Ullrich extends his right hand first. I clasp it and he pulls me in to whisper something in my ear, twisting my right wrist.
&quot;That was a wonderful speech, son,&quot; he says. &quot;A lot different than I remember.&quot;
&quot;Huh?&quot; I mutter.
He tries to twist further, but I resist him.
&quot;Nothing. You wouldn&apos;t get it,&quot; he says, releasing my hand, and we turn away in smiles, waving to the audience.
The auditorium clears out shortly after that. The cadets are either too excited for their families&apos; parties, too drunk, or too hungover after three hours of sitting, all eager from the restlessness of hearing so many names.
Like all of them, I&apos;m happy and afraid, but I&apos;m more of both than they&apos;ll ever be. Overjoyed for this brief stillness like rising to the surface of a lake after being bound in briny, dark depths. Catching that first breath of air is an elixir, for the exhaustion this unweathered body feels as phantom pains of an agonizing past.
And so I&apos;m more afraid than they could ever be, too, because I&apos;ve seen every outcome of this lie. What is survivor&apos;s guilt called when you hold it for a future passed? Can I live with myself when this is over?
You can, that Ellie says. She&apos;s still there in another life. The thought is useless. This present was never yours to hold on to in the first place.
And so I can relish this day, drinking to the joy of the unconscious as if my eyes were fresh; as if that past Titus were still within me; holding to that brilliant sense of purpose that stirs me to fight for all I&apos;ve ever loved.
I can&apos;t have it all. But just enough just might be enough.
Somewhere behind me, the mass exodus swarms the last-lettered seats. Berguard is up front. Zebal and Vermillion are far behind, along with nameless Sylvia, and after such a flood of bodies crowds the aisle, I know there&apos;s no chance I can get back to them.
Something grabs below my eyes from behind, startling me. They&apos;re fingers.
&quot;Guess who?&quot;
&quot;Someone that isn&apos;t tall enough to blind me and do it right,&quot; I say, but my stomach twists for a second, afraid I might see her just like the way I left her.
&quot;Guess,&quot; she says.
I still find myself frozen there.
&quot;Hey, it&apos;s a joke . . . are you going to turn around?&quot; She asks.
&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; I say, sheepishly. That phantom shame makes me feel as if I don&apos;t deserve to see her at all, remembering that look of betrayal on her face when the cold steel was inside her &mdash; but she sneaks around me.
&quot;Last name is the only thing I could ever come before you in, I guess,&quot; she says.
Isla Assal.
Her blue eyes are so bright when she looks up at me. So little she knows of anything I did to her.
&quot;So you&apos;re going into intelligence. Just like your father did,&quot; I say.
&quot;That&apos;s right! How did you know that?&quot;
&quot;You told me. A couple days from now, actually.&quot;
&quot;You&apos;re pretty strange, you know that?&quot; Isla laughs. She looks past me, and finds her Fireteam-mates gesturing for her to come, in some kind of a rush. &quot;Say . . . Vera&apos;s celebrating our fireteam at the Vermillion Estate, in the main house.&quot;
&quot;Sounds like a grand time,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Have fun. I bet Valentina&apos;s excited, too.&quot;
&quot;To visit, you mean?&quot;
&quot;Huh?&quot;
&quot;Valentina told us she was only coming to visit. That she was celebrating with you, instead,&quot; she says.
&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; I say. &quot;Shows how well I remember things.&quot; But she never asked for us to go out. Despite all the anticipation of planning something, nothing ever came to be because we kept putting it off, and that&apos;s why I went on that trip beyond the walls in the first place. And I know exactly where I&apos;ll find her: the first one I&apos;ll convince of this plan.
&quot;It&apos;s a pretty tight list, you know how Vermillion functions are. Maybe you could be my guest of honor?&quot;"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":89,"ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":1,"ChapterFull":42,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":89,"Index":136,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"131","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Titus uses Isla&apos;s invitation to approach Valentina in her shed and ask for help.

I&apos;m fortunate this Titus was already in formal clothes when I took over. There were so many people flooding the event hall that I never caught a glimpse of Sylvia, Romin, or Valentina, despite how hard they might have looked for me. But that&apos;s alright, because by the end of the day, I&apos;m coming for each of them.
The touring cars were already pulled to the front of the lot: drivers in Merlotan royal gear mimicking that of the Afterlife, doused in gold and bluish-red like all the Royal Guard&apos;s whites were drowned in barrels of wine. The whole way there, they mocked Isla for our connection, inferring there was something else behind it, but I could feel that joy inside her that I was with her.
My eyes catch the ground-level windows of the cellar. Still pitch black. Either she sulks inside, or these monsters didn&apos;t even send a car for her.
The inner hall of the Vermillion Estate was even more immaculate than I last remembered it. I might have been the only person here past the Vermillions that treaded in the Afterlife, and somehow, after seeing the perfect marble walls and polished floors of every building in that land above the clouds, this all feels like a convincing imitation.
Isla tucked her hand around my arm and introduced me to everyone that would listen. She blushed every time they called me her &quot;brilliant man.&quot; I felt worse when I remembered I was using her for a pass on to the grounds of the estate, but better when I knew my presence made her day all the better.
I excused myself to the restroom. It took half an hour to navigate the labyrinth of corridors full of servants and guests, punctuating the red-and-gold hallways with black and white, and when I finally made it to the entryway where the morning sun shimmered through thinner smog, I noticed the lights were still off in the stone-walled shed.
The greenskeepers were asked to trim the already immaculately-shaped bushes, but only the front, so the guests would have another reason not to doubt the prowess of the Vermillion name. The side of the house was bare, and riding on the excuse that I&apos;m either drunk or lost, I headed for the shed.
I pressed my ear to the thick wooden door, hearing nothing at all, so I tried the handle. The door was locked . . . but from the outside.
With the key still in it.
I slipped inside before anyone could notice. The room was just like I left it that night: the posh, gold-plated bed made with fine silken covers sitting against the cold stone wall, the entire space submersed beneath the ground, lit only by candles or the faint trickle of light from the grated windows, with so much dust that I coughed and sneezed.
I&apos;ve been waiting for several minutes now. I hear a commotion, but it&apos;s not from outside. It&apos;s an echo, and once I realize I&apos;m standing over that grate that allowed us to escape, I jump onto her bed.
Footsteps slosh through the drainage pipe leading out towards the foothills, growing louder until I hear her mutter to herself. Maybe she walked all this way. Or maybe her mother sent a car late, just to spite her and make her wait.
I hear the thick metal grate lift off the recession in the floor like a manhole cover, just a crack, and somewhere beneath, her solid heels clatter against the steel rungs of the escape ladder. The grate drags against the uneven cobblestone as nails on a chalkboard, and from the ground, she emerges wearing her finely-woven garments, facing the other way, hair still perfect, hat and clothes spotless and clean without a single drop of mud caked on them.
She raises from the drainage tunnel like a water lily blossoming in mere moments from a murky lake, and it amazes me how such a colorful form can persist in the doldrums of this hopeless chamber.
&quot;Gods be damned,&quot; she mutters to herself, removing her hat, exposing the ears that twitch to her surroundings, and when the bed creaks beneath me, she wheels around to find me sitting there.
She&apos;s speechless. But I&apos;m short on time, and this is the only way I can prove it to her. All I needed was the means, because I&apos;ve rehearsed the words enough times.
&quot;I&apos;m here because I need you to believe me when I say the next unthinkable string of words.&quot; She still refuses to speak, covering her head with her hat, paralyzed with too much humiliation to be angry. &quot;In another life I was here in this cellar, where you told me everything. I&apos;m aware of it all. Your spiteful mother. Your bastard father. The ears on top of your head that prove there&apos;s a whole other world far beyond there, with so much we couldn&apos;t possibly imagine.&quot;
She sits down on a crate.
&quot;But that&apos;s roughly six days from now. Some time after we go to the Vermillion club. You&apos;re worried that one of the bouncers like Marcel won&apos;t let you in.&quot;
&quot;Why are you saying these things . . . what are you? Are you doing this to threaten me?&quot; Valentina asks as she trembles.
&quot;I would never hurt you. But there&apos;s a fate far worse that awaits all of us, and I&apos;ve lived that future, over and over again, where . . . Gods, how many times has it been now that I&apos;ve explained this to you?&quot;
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
&quot;Every time I die, I go back. I&apos;ve been living this same loop for ages, and over and over, I&apos;ve lost everyone I care about. All of Blackwater is going to be destroyed, and only I can prevent this.&quot;
&quot;You . . . you&apos;re saying&mdash;&quot;
&quot;But I can&apos;t stop this. I can&apos;t do it alone. For so long I thought others were just an obstacle to perfection, that asking for help was an act of charity, but I was Gods-damn wrong, Valentina, and I need your help. You have some dreadful people in your family, but you are loved beyond compare by me, Sylvia, and Romin, regardless of that perfect act you&apos;ve honed into a career.&quot; I lean forward, looking into her emerald eyes with the slightest crescents I hadn&apos;t noticed before.
&quot;Please, Valentina, I beg of you. Will you help me? And most of all &mdash; can you believe me?&quot;
She nervously traces her manicured thumbs around each other. For putting her through so many different emotions at once, she looks like she&apos;ll cry, but she persists.
&quot;On the stage, there, that massive headache that cast you down,&quot; she says. &quot;The change in tone. Those words you said. It was different than anything I&apos;d ever heard come out of your mouth, and you believed it. You made me believe it.&quot;
&quot;That&apos;s when I came back,&quot; I say, unbuttoning the cuff on my ceremonial clothes, folding back the sleeve until the slashes of the thread are exposed. &quot;You remember this scar from when I was a kid?&quot;
&quot;Gods above, Titus!&quot; She says. &quot;What happened? What did you do to it?&quot; The flesh is so latticed by glowing cuts that my entire arm looks mangled.
&quot;Each of those is a death. And this&mdash;this is the earliest I&apos;ve been able to return to. I&apos;m not sure I have it in me to go again. And I think I&apos;ve decided this is my last chance.&quot;
&quot;What do you need?&quot; She asks.
&quot;What I mean is that I&apos;ve died, over and &mdash; wait, did I hear that right?&quot;
&quot;What do you need from me?&quot; She asks.
&quot;I&apos;m here to tell you I was wrong in not asking you to come with me beyond the walls. I need you to travel with me, because there&apos;s only so much I can do alone, and I&apos;ve got something to show you that will change your life forever.&quot;
&quot;You have my help, though I&apos;m not sure what I can do,&quot; Valentina says.
&quot;Then meet me tomorrow morning at Clint&apos;s trade building, before the sun rise and right after the Seminary bell.&quot;
&quot;What should I bring?&quot;
&quot;I&apos;ve got all the Snowdrifting gear.

The feeling of fear is new to me when I stand outside her door. I don&apos;t wait here because I&apos;m afraid of the other side of her. I&apos;m scared of something else. 
Maybe that inching anxiety came back to me since I left my peace with Ellie in another time. Old habits of thought and feeling persist as wine soaks its flavors into the wood of a barrel, coloring every future batch with the memory, and so in only a matter of hours, the walls have already begun to erect themselves. 
I have to act now while they&apos;re only chest-high.
The door is cracked. Inside, I hear the scratchings of charcoal against paper, and when I open the door further, the faint smell of her perfume wafts into the hall. I wonder if this is how she feels: at a loss for words, waiting for the right moment to speak and break the stillness.
&quot;Sylvia?&quot; I venture.
She turns her head, astonished. &quot;Oh, hey Titus. Is something wrong?&quot;
&quot;Of course not. Why do you ask?&quot;
&quot;Oh . . . I&apos;ve never seen you come up here unless you needed something,&quot; she says.
&quot;No. I&apos;m here for <em>you</em>,&quot; I say. 
She drops the chalk at the base of the inclined easel, looking as if she&apos;s been struck by something, and turns to face me. Her hair is disheveled, her fingertips are covered in black, and her crimson eyes shine bright &mdash; looking like either a tortured artist or the Chymaeran caricature on the page &mdash; yet she&apos;s still beautiful as ever, with the tender glance she reserves for me.
She wears nightgown shorts that fit tight around her thick legs, cuffing the flesh of her pale white skin streaked lightly with charcoal. Her top is thin and smeared the same way, used for little more than utility to keep the art separate from her body. I feel my heart jump when I realize she&apos;s wearing nothing under it, and that same recurring fear discomforts me, but this time I won&apos;t let those anxieties tangle with the warm, electric feeling as it floods my nerves.
My mind fills with the fantasy of any way I&apos;ve dreamt to have her. I recall every time I felt her relax in the presence of my strength, protecting her, living vicariously through imagining what it felt like for her to melt, but this is no longer a stroke of my ego. It&apos;s something more than that. It has to be: not just a mission to be completed, but something everlasting to be beheld.
And then it breaks: whatever last unlikely brace that held my composure, the same one Ellie disarmed though months of caring for me as I pulled my soul together again. The tears stream down my face.
I can feel her pull me in to the warmth of her body as my sobs are snuffed out. She reaches her arms over my shoulders to hold me right, tracing her nails on my back with such gentle intention, until I can muster the strength to say anything, and then I feel the need to explain myself, to preserve my pride.
&quot;I just . . . I . . .&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s okay,&quot; she says. She sits me down on her bed and lets me cry until her shoulder as she tells me I have no reason to explain myself. &quot;It must have been so hard.&quot;
&quot;I did everything. All I ever wanted was just to save everyone! And they died, over and over again, and all the horrible things I had to do, just to&mdash;&quot; I let out a squeaking gasp that startles me as my throat jumps, but she only tightens her grasp. She kisses me lightly on the forehead, and even in the deepest throes of sorrow and tragedy I can really, truly feel how much I love her.
I&apos;m not afraid anymore.
I wipe my eyes and turn to face her, our lips so close though I&apos;m a sniveling mess, only to find that she nearly cries for me, too. All that separates us is just the catalyzing energy it takes to get over that wall, and we can both feel our stomachs rise with blissful static. We draw closer and closer, until soon enough I&apos;m surprised when our lips are already touching, and my hand caresses behind her ear, drawing her closer because now I won&apos;t ever get enough of her.
I&apos;m surprised again when she twists me down against the bed, but the static rises further as I pull off her thin shirt smeared with stains of soot, exposing her full breasts that compress as she sits on my waist and tightens her chest against me. Her tongue flickers inside my mouth as I hold her tightly in all the places I&apos;ve only ever undressed with my eyes, fighting to turn her over so I can tear off my own shirt, and when I do, we press ourselves together to share the warmth of our bare skin.
Neither of us venture past removing another garment, too engrossed with the voiceless passion of our lips we&apos;ve been mute to for so long. I hear her moan softly as I plant wet kisses upon her neck, grabbing all the soft places I&apos;ve only touched in daydreams as she squirms under me.
I look into her eyes after another kiss and she cracks a smile: not just of joy, but of good humor. And then she can&apos;t stop laughing.
&quot;What? What&apos;s so funny?&quot; I ask, self-aware now of anything stupid I might have done. She sucks on her unblackened forefinger and drags it across my nose, returning a full stripe of charcoal.
&quot;I got myself all over you,&quot; she says.
&quot;I don&apos;t mind being your canvas,&quot; I tell her. I reach down inside her shorts to try and pleasure her further, but she stops me, grabbing my hand.
&quot;Is it alright if we . . . stop here?&quot; Sylvia asks.
&quot;Oh. Yeah, of course,&quot; I say, retracting my fingers. &quot;I&apos;m sorry.&quot;
&quot;No, no, it&apos;s alright. I just want to savor . . . us,&quot; she says, and when I lay beside her, I wrap my arms around her waist. &quot;It both took us such courage to get here after all.&quot;
I might cry again from how safe I feel here, and she knows that from how I tremble, remembering the feeling of death my mind has tried so hard to suppress.
&quot;Sometimes you just have to let go, Titus,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;no matter how painful it is&mdash;&quot;
&quot;&mdash;You have to succumb to it and feel it through.&quot; I use her words before she can speak them.
&quot;You took the words from my mouth,&quot; she says, caressing the side of my face as we lay next to each other. &quot;I just want you to know that I&apos;m always watching you: ever since the orphanage, ever since you saved me from that darkness, ever since you showed me that kindness, you know, because . . .&quot;
&quot;Because you love me.&quot;
&quot;I do,&quot; she says.
&quot;And because I love you too, Sylvia.&quot; 
She nestles her head into my neck, and I can feel her chest rise and fall as she breathes deeply. The same timeless feeling of relaxation washes over me that I felt when I was with Ellie, and I know this moment will forever live in my mind, no matter how long I live in this last cycle.
&quot;I came with one question to ask, but now I have two,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;What are they?&quot; She asks, tracing her fingers against my chest.
&quot;I was wrong to tell you that I didn&apos;t need you on this trip beyond the walls. I need to do better at letting people help me, and I need your help out there.&quot;
She laughs. &quot;You&apos;re so damn cute.&quot;
&quot;No. Really, though.&quot;
&quot;Of course I&apos;ll come with you,&quot; she says.
&quot;Can you meet me in the morning at Clint&apos;s?&quot;
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; She asks. &quot;You know you&apos;re staying the night here.&quot;
&quot;Oh . . . uh, yeah, of course,&quot; I say, with a stupid grin on my face.
&quot;I hope that wasn&apos;t your last question,&quot; she says, pulling me closer.
It wasn&apos;t. Though I&apos;m sure I know the answer.

Sylvia and I show up at my house an hour before meeting. The lights are off, which isn&apos;t uncommon &mdash; often times the caretaker leaves them off so my sister can sleep, keeping on a couple to make her feel safe.
There&apos;s only two modes I find Ellie in. Either she&apos;s riled up to get to school, so excited about meeting a friend or show-and-tell that I have to force her to eat, and other times, she&apos;s still sleeping, and I have to feed her and nearly drag her out the door. Unlike other kids in families with full-time parents, the house isn&apos;t filled with enough fun activities to keep her up late, so she often sleeps sooner than I do.
My keys jangle in the door as Sylvia shivers behind me, burying her nose in a crimson scarf. I expect a voice, anything &mdash; but all I&apos;m met with is an eerie silence.
&quot;This can&apos;t be right. She was here last time!&quot; I say, and I rack my brain over happenings more than a year ago. Dad slept at the shop like he always does. Ellie tugged at my shirt, pulling me towards that commemorative wall to ask me about the names in the stones.
I sniff the air. It smells like early breakfast, so I know the caretakers made something for her, and when I cross the dark foyer to check the kitchen, I found she already ate.
I call her name again and again, voice wavering, my fingers caressing the handle of the switchblade in my pocket as I ascend the stairs, remembering the despair of what she last told me.
&quot;The door was locked, Titus. You say she&apos;s good about locking the front door, right?&quot; Sylvia calls up to me.
&quot;Yeah. Usually,&quot; I say. I open the door to her room and it&apos;s freezing. My first thought is to check the window, but as soon as I notice the curtains don&apos;t dance, I know the window is shut. My fingers trace the top of the window. Locked. And when I scour around her room, her school bag is missing from the spot it usually sits.
&quot;I&apos;m sure she left. That little girl is better at waking up than I am most mornings,&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;You&apos;re probably right,&quot; I say, but I could have sworn I walked with her. The memory is hazy. All I can remember is remembering the way I remembered it. Maybe last time I showed up earlier &mdash; and this time, she got tired of waiting. Or maybe I&apos;ve changed enough already in this worldline to affect her.
&quot;She&apos;s probably fine,&quot; Sylvia says, standing in Ellie&apos;s doorway as I turn to leave. Deep down I&apos;m relieved I don&apos;t see her, and maybe that pushes my convictions over the edge.
I descend the stairs to leave, but Sylvia goes deeper into the hallway. Something catches her attention, and when she opens the door to my old room:
&quot;Dear Gods, what happened here?&quot;
My heart skips. I rush down the dark hallway and poke my head in the room in mere seconds. Sylvia sits in the middle of the floor.
&quot;Why is everything gone?&quot;
&quot;Oh. You scared me,&quot; I tell her, catching my breath. &quot;I sold it all a long time ago.&quot;
&quot;But why?&quot; Sylvia asks. &quot;Your bed. That bright red dresser. The toys, and the books, what happened to it all? Did . . . did Clint make you sell it, in his store?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; I tell her. &quot;I just couldn&apos;t stand looking at it. It reminded me too much of something I could never have again, and letting those things go&mdash;&quot; I say, tensioning my fingers around the necklace that&apos;s persisted around my neck through almost everything. &quot;I kept the little that mattered. Just enough.&quot;
&quot;But that&apos;s so sad,&quot; she says.
&quot;The profits helped Ellie live here longer in her childhood home.&quot; Though she deserved so much more than this house that&apos;s way too big for one-and-a-half people, I think.
&quot;You remember the first time we kissed?&quot;
The question catches me off guard.
&quot;You mean . . . last night? Of course I do.&quot;
&quot;No, you idiot,&quot; she laughs. &quot;You seriously forgot? Your grandfather Everett read us Seminary tales. There was the one about the poisoned princess that could only be saved with a single kiss. And we were in this room together after he left, playing pretend before your mom would take me back to the orphanage, and I laid down on your bed, playing dead, and...&quot;
&quot;Nope. Doesn&apos;t ring a bell. Maybe it was too traumatic,&quot; I tell her, and she glares at me with her crimson eyes until I apologize.
&quot;It wasn&apos;t just a kiss, though. Gods damn, you must have snuck in your parents&apos; room the night before when&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Enough.&quot;
&quot;&mdash;they were getting a little intense and got some ideas, or maybe&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Stop it.&quot;
&quot;&mdash;you thought my face was a slice of pie, hah, the way you dragged your tongue&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Enough!&quot; I shout, crumpled on the floor with my head in my hands. &quot;Yeah, I remember. I never wanted to again, though! Please, Khiras, dear Gods above...&quot;
&quot;I never said it was bad, though. You know how many times I&apos;ve thought of that late at night?&quot;
&quot;That&apos;s your business,&quot; I tell her.
She crawls up to me.
&quot;Well, I hope you&apos;re ready for a whole lot more,&quot; she says, but in her attempt at being sexy, I catch her off-guard. I throw my hands aside and lick her all the way across the face, pinning her to the ground.
She screams.
&quot;You can have as much of this as you like!&quot; I shout, tickling her as I wag my tongue above her face. She screams and jolts in laughter every time I poke her sides, though I only hold her down harder, making her laugh even more.
She headbutts me when I tickle beneath her armpit, and I fall back, stunned.
&quot;Oh, Gods, I am so sorry,&quot; she says, drawing deep breaths after losing them all to fits of convulsive howling. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m fine,&quot; I say, holding my hand into the bright rays of Lighttime that filter through the window: dragging my hand against my nose a couple times, only to find there&apos;s no red.
&quot;No, no, no, I&apos;m not losing you!&quot; Sylvia says, pressing her hands against my sternum with firm compressions before I sweep her legs and she crashes to my chest.
&quot;You need to take some acting lessons from Valentina,&quot; I say.
&quot;Oh, hush.&quot;
And then I pull her head in for another attempt to correct my past. I make the most of it, and some time later, we rush out the door when we realize we&apos;re going to be late.


Sylvia and I hold hands as we approach Valentina and Romin at the shop.
&quot;When the fuck did that happen?&quot; Romin asks.

We make it to the first safe-house by sundown, and Valentina and Sylvia hold up surprisingly well, despite my father&apos;s sentiments that they were too wimpy and frail, insisting they stay back or else they&apos;d get frostbite. It&apos;s been the dynamic of our group that keeps us the warmest. We only poured through a hundredth of our shared memories. The time and toil passed so quickly that we were surprised when it was up.
They&apos;re still na ve to the future that awaits us. I can still feel the long shadow of the Afterlife&apos;s avarice hang over the whole city, but I&apos;m the only one aware that the exalted gods above us bleed all the same.
Part of me still doesn&apos;t want to tell them how it ends, but I know better. I need to trust they&apos;re strong enough to handle that truth, no matter how bitter and horrifying it is.
I just struggle to find a way to start. They keep me distracted with questions about Chymaerans and Snowdrifting, and any time Sylvia or Valentina edge into an emotional topic, Romin lambastes them with his witless humor, quickly changing the subject. All that persists is just that feeling of being watched. The wind howls, though there are so few animals beyond the walls that can muster such a call. And as much as Romin comes to accept that the First Red might be a fairytale, I know they&apos;re real, hiding in every snowbank to act on anything that comes too close. They scare me more than the Chymaera.
After Romin unloads his limited rations of Dead Essence in the old fireplace, the dull orange light brightens with crimson, fighting off the cool, pale moonlight trapped in the tattered curtains. Romin and Valentina sleep close&mdash;just far enough so they don&apos;t think we think they&apos;re that close&mdash;only coming together when they think Sylvia and I are fast asleep.
I wake up and they&apos;re on opposite sides of the room. Romin thumbs through the picture book he read last time like an oversized toddler, and Valentina straightens her hair in a reflective surface, until she realizes nobody&apos;s going to see it.
&quot;Did you guys hear that last night?&quot; Sylvia asks, wiping the dust-covered plates with snow-dampened cloth before she prepares us some of the rations.
&quot;The wind was loud. A couple animals, and that was about it,&quot; I mutter, realizing I slept soundly for the first time in ages.
&quot;What about you, Valentina? Romin?&quot;
They shake their heads.
Sylvia says, &quot;There were footfalls, in the snow. I looked outside, but it was so dark, and with all the trees, I couldn&apos;t see anything.&quot;
&quot;A pack of wolves, maybe?&quot; Romin says.
&quot;No. I could have sworn I saw light,&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;Another Snowdrifter, maybe,&quot; says Valentina.
&quot;Not a chance,&quot; I say. &quot;The odds of that are slim. And if it&apos;s that late &mdash; and you&apos;re on the edge of freezing to death &mdash; you&apos;d be pounding on the door of this cabin. You wouldn&apos;t just keep going: you&apos;d need far too much Essence just to stay warm!&quot;
If it wasn&apos;t a penniless Snowdrifter, it&apos;d have to be someone with such a high level of Essence that the weather wouldn&apos;t phase them. The Afterlife has no reason to come out here. Plus, I think we&apos;re still too far from the First Red.
&quot;Doesn&apos;t matter,&quot; I say. &quot;Let&apos;s finish up breakfast and keep moving.&quot; There isn&apos;t just one stop that awaits us today. I want to go all the way to the end.
Romin and I pull a sled while the girls walk beside us. The path I took last time comes back to me, so I find I never need to use the map.
A blistering snowstorm blasts between us, casting us each in our own little white room unless we stand closely together, the wind erasing our deep footprints as soon as our boots leave the ground. The snow feels shallower and crunchier than I last remember, and all I can think of are Sylvia&apos;s words.
I marvel at how well the plan has worked so far, but even more than that, it surprises me how little anxiety I carry. I&apos;ve done everything to prepare, and I&apos;ve done everything I can, and the dream doesn&apos;t seem so insurmountable anymore.
This worldline will change everything. For once I can finally reach that celestial pebble of Pure Essence and vest myself as a Mask of the Gods: my true birthright. My stomach fills with the static of excitement when I feel that dream spill over into a tangible reality.
I can barely contain myself when the cabin&apos;s dilapidated roof emerges from the top of the snowdrifts. I&apos;m running now despite my exhaustion&mdash;and although my friends laugh as I trundle through tall pockets of powder, I can feel it call to me. I&apos;ve earned an easy end to all this suffering. I can feel how badly I lust for that beautiful dream when I bash the door open at its hinges, only to find that snowflakes have already siphoned in.
The barricaded door to the study hangs by a single hinge, and then that feeling of powerless anguish returns to me, cursing the hubris I allowed to overtake my sense of reality.
My heaving breaths of exhaustion don&apos;t stop when I&apos;m no longer running. My friends prod at my eagerness in good humor, but I can no longer hear them as they enter. I scramble on my hands and knees to tear back the carpet in that same corner. Touch confirms my fears when I find no cool metal box beneath the floor.
I thought that I held so much of that poisonous fear, churning in my stomach, that I became immune to the highs and lows of peace and desperation, but here I am, heaving in shallow breaths on the floor of the office, fighting the urge to vomit, gasping for cold air, almost just as lost as all the times before when I navigated this world alone.
But this time is different. Romin lifts me to my feet as Sylvia instructs me to breathe. I feel so pathetic, but in their concern I realize they genuinely care about me: not because of some favor I asked them, hinging on debts overdue.
Valentina reassures me. &quot;It&apos;s okay, Titus. We&apos;re still going to make it through this. All of us,&quot; she says. 
&quot;Who cares about a stupid necklace? I&apos;ll find you something far better,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Most days I work repossessions with Carmine business. Nobody hides anything from us.&quot;
&quot;Just stay strong, for all of us,&quot; Sylvia says, and with all my friends smiling back at me, the gravity of this horrendous outcome becomes just a little bit more tenable. &quot;We&apos;re here for you all the way until the end.&quot;
I mutter incoherently. &quot;The whole plan. It was all around that piece of Pure Essence. And it&apos;s missing. But I&apos;m the only one who could have known . . .&quot;
&quot;All we can do is move on,&quot; Romin says.
&quot;He&apos;s right,&quot; says Valentina, &quot;and you still have that surprise for us, right? So don&apos;t give in now!&quot;
I made a promise to Ellie. I swore on our reunion in the Reservoir that I would never return again by my own hands, and I refuse to break that.
I&apos;m not going back. I will never go back again, and with that decision consciously made, I have the courage to look ahead once more.
&quot;Change of plans, then. We&apos;re going to keep going,&quot; I tell them.
&quot;But what about the loot? The sleds?&quot; Sylvia asks.
&quot;That&apos;s not our priority anymore. That&apos;s not what this trip was about, after all,&quot; I say, as I pick up the framed picture of me, Lyra, my birth mother, and Ullrich, pulling the worn photograph from the shattered glass as proof for what I plan to do next. I turn to Romin.
&quot;You deserve to be rewarded for your loyalty and hard work to the Carmine. This is your chance to turn the tides of the upcoming war, and convince our greatest allies that it&apos;s time to return.&quot;
His eyes grow wide. &quot;You don&apos;t mean...&quot;"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":93,"ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":3,"ChapterFull":44,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":93,"Index":142,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"137","Synopsis":"","Summary":"They make it to the Backwoods, threatened at gunpoint when discovered.

We trudge on for another three hours, until the fear of the darkness begins to embed itself in my friends. They believe in our shared mission and every word I tell them. I explain just enough for them to understand, but not too much. I anticipate their genuine reactions.
The weather climbs, faintly, a few degrees at a time. Grasses can be made out through slush, instead of plated sheets of ice scraping the near infinite landscape.
&quot;Can you feel that?&quot; I ask them. &quot;The temperature, yeah, it&apos;s rising,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;I thought it was coincidence.&quot;
&quot;We&apos;re almost there,&quot; I say.
And then a sudden sense of unease, the feeling of being watched.
We&apos;re getting closer and closer to the territory of the group that will kill to hide their presence. The crunch of icy footfalls catch Romin&apos;s attention first. Six forms, concealed in transparent Chymaeran scales, steady their firearms. Last time it was because Lyra was with me. And I know the only reason they don&apos;t pull the trigger this time is because of Romin&apos;s Carmine mark.
&quot;State your business or be executed where you stand,&quot; one calls out. &quot;There is no return from here.&quot;
&quot;We bring a message for the Elders of the First Red. The message you&apos;ve all been waiting for,&quot; I insist.
&quot;There is no story of Blackwater our finest messengers can&apos;t deliver. We are surprised my nothing, so what is your business here,  Snowdrifter? How did you find us, and how do you know who we are?&quot; A familiar voice asks, wrapped in a white scarf that masks his dark face.
&quot;The end is near,&quot; I say. &quot;The Afterlife are preparing their last strike to reap what they have sown.&quot;
&quot;Said every false prophet for the last two-hundred years,&quot; Raine says. &quot;Your lies don&apos;t interest me. I&apos;m interested in what the Carmine Brother has to say.&quot;
Which is exactly what I&apos;ve planned on.
&quot;Brother Romin. Second Blood. Son of the District Fourteen Carmine,&quot; he says.
I see Raine&apos;s eyes light up on a realization he hasn&apos;t quite grasped yet.
&quot;The Fourteenth District,&quot; Raine says, lowering his gun, though the other five aren&apos;t so easily disarmed. He&apos;s light with his words because he&apos;s not the one being threatened. &quot;My sons used to live there. I know it&apos;s a common name in the Carmine, after our founder, but one of them even had your name.&quot;
&quot;I lost my mother and father long ago, at the same time,&quot; Romin says. &quot;It was a freak accident. Closed casket funeral, and I was forced to pick up the slack.&quot;
&quot;Huh,&quot; Raine says, uncomfortably scratching his brow while both sides come to the realization faster than these two brainlets can. &quot;Just know that this is not a personal act&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Dear Gods above, you&apos;re both as big as you are stupid,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;Really? Do you not see what this is?&quot;
&quot;Now, Val, really?&quot; Romin asks, annoyed. &quot;I&apos;m trying to keep them from executing us on the spot!&quot;
She groans. &quot;Last name. What&apos;s your last name, Romin?&quot; &quot;Zebal. But why? These outwallers aren&apos;t going to know me&mdash;the fabled First Red&apos;s been out here for decades!&quot;
The six Carmine drop their rifles. The name is familiar to all of them. They&apos;ve only heard the stories of this child for nearly two decades, told over and over by the father just to keep that memory alive.
&quot;That means . . . you&apos;re my . . .&quot; Raine mutters, stepping closer to Romin as we drop our hands, as if we&apos;re a vision more transparent than they are. &quot;Oh Gods, how many years have I been gone?&quot;
I turn to Romin. For once I think the dumb brute doesn&apos;t get it, but it&apos;s because he&apos;s not elated by this discovery. He&apos;s mad. Furious, even, and he pushes his father away, casting him backwards onto his back while the five others raise their guns again.
&quot;No! Put your guns down,&quot; Romin&apos;s father demands, before raising his head. &quot;But why, son? Why would you do that when we&apos;ve been dreaming of this moment for years?&quot;
&quot;No, you dreamed of this!&quot; Romin shouts. &quot;I had to live! I had to pick up the slack of my dead brother and fill your shoes because I never had a father to raise me. Ryder died thinking you were gone. And me, Gods be damned, I lived on in your name, only to find you&apos;re hiding out here the whole time? And after all this time...&quot; He pauses, trying to channel his spiteful rage into a string of words. &quot;After all this time, you and the First Red left us there to protect nothing? I spent my whole life trying to keep the Carmine going . . . to keep them strong, when we were all just a fake for true leadership,&quot; he said, heaving from the exhaustion of a single breath.
&quot;Romin. Romin, it&apos;s not like that,&quot; Commander Zebal said. &quot;Just let me explain!&quot;
&quot;Then why didn&apos;t you tell me? Why did you leave me with nothing besides a vault door I couldn&apos;t open? It&apos;s . . . It&apos;s as worse as lying,&quot; <em>Dad, </em>the word balanced on his tongue, but he wasn&apos;t sure if he was ready to say it.
&quot;But you know the value of that secret,&quot; Zebal said. &quot;The First Blood are alive and well, but it wasn&apos;t without sacrifice. There were too many moles in the main temple. And when the calling of our mission came &mdash; nobody could know that your mother and I went somewhere else.&quot;
Romin doesn&apos;t reply. He knows his father was right. He&apos;s amazed by his dedication&mdash;but feelings don&apos;t require logic to feel legitimate.
Zebal continues: &quot;Rose and I had to leave. We had to. I know it wasn&apos;t fair to our boys. It wasn&apos;t fair to Ryder, or you, but we had to.
She and I. Your...your mother and I . . . e e had to.&quot; His mouth and tongue contorted on the letter &apos;S&apos; but quickly changed back. &quot;Romin, we had to. If they knew, the truth would destroy us.&quot;
&quot;Then what has the Carmine been doing this whole time?&quot; Romin said. &quot;Pissing in circles? Are we just a club full of blind idiots? Are we just a distraction for you? What&apos;s the purpose of it, what&apos;s the purpose of doing anything?&quot;
&quot;Son.&quot; Commander Zebal purses his lips as he approaches his youngest. &quot;Son, you&apos;ve done a service to the future of Humanity,&quot; he says. &quot;The Carmine of Blackwater are the reason we could get this far.
The value of your work saves the lives of good people.&quot;
&quot;But...&quot; Romin says. &quot;Ever since Ryder passed, we haven&apos;t been close to what it used to be.&quot; He&apos;s petrified in the same metal casting that immortalizes his brother, his face sullen with a certain weakness that wears against his laugh lines in a grimace. &quot;I&apos;ve never lived up to his image. I look at the statue that immortalizes him, and every morning I stand in its shadow. It feels like it&apos;s never enough.&quot; His voice now trembles. It&apos;s seeing the mannerisms of someone he thought he had forgotten so long ago that grips him with such an inescapable weakness, where his brawn is no match.
&quot;You&apos;ve done enough, son. The Carmine has done enough. And it&apos;s done everything it&apos;s had to,&quot; he replied.
He embraces his last living son. He weeps for the death of Ryder&mdash; a sense of guilt nagging him in his utter yet forced lack of awareness. &quot;I want you to never forget that I&apos;m proud of you,&quot; he says, &quot;and I always will be. The chance to see my son again is a beautiful gift.&quot;
The corners of Romin&apos;s mouth stretch across his face, and a certain glow emanates from his chest, thawing the stillness of his joints. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he says. 
&quot;I still need to know what brings you here. Nobody else would have this chance, but the best gift I can give my son and his closest friends is the benefit of the doubt.&quot;
&quot;A message. The city is in danger, and only the Carmine have the capacity to give Blackwater a fighting chance against the Carmine. It&apos;s time to go home,&quot; Romin says."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Saving Face","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Four","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Forty-Five","ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":4,"ChapterFull":45,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":143,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"138","Synopsis":"Something is different this time.

The weather is temperate. The grass is verdant. And as Romin parts with his father to catch up on decades of lost time, Valentina and Sylvia find no words to hold their amazement when they see the Backwoods for the first time.
What amazes them most is the surplus of Essence and how it&apos;s used so openly: farmhands tending crops in once inhospitable climates, cultivating them with a turnaround of mere weeks, with the same technique of that chamber beyond time.
Young cadets of the true First Blood train along the walls, learning how to harness generational Essence to protect themselves and the village. The buildings germinate from the sides of dirt trails with stripped birch pillars, as if the city had grown from its surroundings.
When the distraction and awe diminish enough, they realize we&apos;re not just wandering aimlessly, that I&apos;m taking them somewhere.
&quot;Where are we going, Titus?&quot; Sylvia asks.
&quot;I&apos;ve got something to show Valentina,&quot;I tell her.
&quot;What is it?&quot; Val asks.
&quot;We&apos;re going to the west walls. A village this size couldn&apos;t survive without help.&quot;
&quot;Not help from Blackwater, of course,&quot; she says. &quot;But who, then?&quot;
&quot;The ones who share your blood,&quot; I say. &quot;They should be here today.
They&apos;ve been supporting the Humans for a long time, and I think they&apos;d be just as amazed if they met you.&quot;
Her eyes light brighter than any expression she acted out for her moving pictures. &quot;You can&apos;t be serious. That&apos;s impossible. I never...&quot;
&quot;We need to hurry! Come on &mdash; they won&apos;t be here for long.&quot;
She tugs with a reluctance, but not enough to show she truly doesn&apos;t want it. &quot;O...okay,&quot; Valentina replies, with a stage fright as if she were giving her first performance.
&quot;You&apos;re gonna be great,&quot; I say.
Her mannerisms remind me of Ellie when we approach them: a childlike mix of disbelief and wonder. I had only seen them in passing when I last arrived here. Their tongues rattled off Ahkvasan in quick, accented words. An orange-striped Ahkvasan commands all the others, ushering them to move boxes of supplies into the barracks.
Valentina approaches awkwardly. She looks back at me.
No. No, go ahead, I gesture, they don&apos;t bite. They&apos;re not animals.
&quot;N&mdash;Nord,&quot; she said. She startles the orange-stripe, and he jumps back a near foot.
&quot;Ahk&apos;na!&quot; He shouts. The others snigger at the easy fright of their leader.
&quot;Sorry, heh. Nord. Do you speak Nord?&quot;
&quot;Yes. Yes, you scare me,&quot; he says. &quot;How can I be service?&quot;
Valentina pauses. She forgets the lines. I know this moment has played in her imagination ever since she learned she was different. She grasps for the words to introduce herself.
&quot;I&apos;m Valentina. I&apos;m like you.&quot;
Orange-stripe snorted: &quot;Hah. Like us? What do you mean?&quot; he says, intrigued as Valentina&apos;s fingers reached for her hat.
I see her hesitate for a few moments. She glances back at me, reflexively, before withdrawing the hat from her head. The foreigners&apos; expressions change from jeering grins to amazement, before cries of disbelief escape from their mouths.
Valentina recoils in fear of mockery, bowing her head, eyes stuck on a patch of dirt she traces with the toe of her boot. She expects them to treat her no different. But she feels their sharp claws lightly trace around her ears and she lets out a squeak. Her ears flutter in response.
&quot;Incredible!&quot; Orange-stripe says. &quot;But the Essence, the Essence . . . with half blood between us and the Humans, do you know if . . .&quot;
Valentina&apos;s eyes meet his with a novel sense of clarity, as if the peace of acceptance has begun to revitalize that half of her. &quot;Raise your hand,&quot; he instructs, and Valentina touches her palm to his.
Mere moments pass before I realized what is happening: the impossible speed of their mannerisms, their speech, lips moving so fast I couldn&apos;t even discern their words, and in awe I realize that it wasn&apos;t the two of them moving fast, but the world around them slowing down. It really is real, the true power of the Ahkvasans, to slow the speed of time &mdash; and I realize I&apos;d seen it once before, in that selfless moment that Valentina saved us from the falling debris.
She draws that same power from within herself. She is truly one of them: her abilities born from two different races, and as they trade words, I see her straighten with a beautiful confidence I&apos;ve never seen before. Not what she acted in the theatre, or the Academy programs, or even when I talked with her.
It&apos;s only a minute that passes. To her, maybe it&apos;s been hours, but either way, I know the eternity of that moment will live with her &mdash; for as long as we all survive.
Sylvia and I leave Valentina there, and Sylvia&apos;s eyes glow as I bring her towards the next destination. &quot;You have something to show me, too, don&apos;t you?&quot; She asks.
It&apos;s the thing I fear the most about all of this, but it&apos;s what can prove, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that this is the right time to act. &quot;I do.

Impossible truths are easier to swallow when they&apos;re told by the ones you cherish, when they&apos;re an emotional investment. It&apos;s why Ellie was disappointed every time I came home late to her, because despite my good intentions&mdash;and all the demands that weighed on me in those years of the Academy, between family, school, and no personal life&mdash;a part of her clung to a persuasive hope every time I said that I would come home to her.
Romin, Sylvia, and Valentina were convinced before all of this by the heaviness of my words, impossible coincidences, and the trust I&apos;ve built within each of them, but when it comes to the intimate strangers that remember nothing of our shared suffering, the persuasion requires far more. Only dramatic acts can cover where the conviction of closeness can&apos;t.
&quot;I know there&apos;s a voice inside you that&apos;s spoken for years, trying to get out,&quot; I tell Sylvia. &quot;You told me in another life.&quot;
&quot;No. It&apos;s just hysteria. Pleading, begging for me to accept that I&apos;m something else, that this is all just a fa ade,&quot;she insists.
&quot;What if I told you there was a chance to stare it down once and for all?&quot; I ask. It gives her pause. Maybe she can feel herself compelled towards that inner truth that terrifies her. &quot;For so long you&apos;ve told me how unexceptional you think you are, but you&apos;re far more than that. You say you&apos;re dragged at my heels towards greatness. That you only thrive in the shadow cast by the three of us, but you are more important, and more powerful than you could ever imagine.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m just scared,&quot; she says, though she doesn&apos;t even know where I lead her.
&quot;I will be with you through it all, from the beginning to the end, and every moment after,&quot; I tell her. &quot;You are the final and most essential piece to this plan. I can&apos;t do this without you.&quot;
&quot;Then I promise you I will try,&quot; she says.
Despite everything that&apos;s worked so far, I can feel my stomach twist on itself. I might be more afraid than she is, because I know exactly what&apos;s going to happen. It&apos;s a huge gamble. It&apos;s inconceivable to think someone so small in size could hold such tremendous power, and I hold myself from remembering the terror of our first encounter.
We reach the steps of the Chieftains&apos; lodge, completely unguarded. The whole village is in an uproar since the prodigal son returned: the one fictionalized by all of Raine&apos;s stories, absorbing all the attention. I&apos;m just lucky how much Romin likes to talk about himself.
It&apos;s just the smallest pebble of Pure Essence, but I can already see how it makes her twitch when we enter. My own sensitivity heightens with the Essence in my circuits from another life.
&quot;Are you sure about this? I just . . .&quot;
&quot;I would do it myself. But my blood refuses it. I&apos;m cursed by a decision I made a long time ago,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;I can hear it again, Gods above,&quot; she cries, holding her head as a splitting migraine brews in her head. &quot;The voice! The voice of the Gods, and it screams to be let out...&quot;
My guilt overtakes me. &quot;It&apos;s okay, Sylvia. There&apos;s time. We can do this again after&mdash;&quot;
She grabs my hand, tensioning her fingers between the spaces of mine, to fill-in the words she can&apos;t speak, and I tighten my hand to share with her my strength.
She hardly has to raise her other hand. The pebble magnetizes to the side of the glass, trembling as it begs to be released, rocking with the slightest motion of her hand as the glass splinters.
&quot;I&apos;m scared, Titus! Oh, Gods, it&apos;s&mdash;&quot;
The protective shield hardly shatters when the stone launches through the jagged hole. It&apos;s only after it makes contact with her hand, absorbing into her circuits entirely, that the pulse of turbulent winds deafen our ears, shattering every window as I feel her embrace me tighter and tighter.
&quot;I&apos;ve got you, I&apos;m never letting go,&quot; I say, though her newfound strength begins to hurt. The smell of ozone floods the small lobby, and though the thousand cuts of glass writhe my flesh as turbulent winds circle around us, a strange heat binds and heals them.
I can feel the resonance of celestial power in my threads, the way my right arm emblazons in a flash of heat, and when silver strands of her hair touch my cheek like ribbons of pure moonlight, I know that this time is different.
&quot;For the first time, you&apos;ve awoken me with real purpose, human,&quot; the Daughter of Khiras says. &quot;You&apos;ve come such a long way. And you really believe this will be the last time?&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m certain of it.&quot;
&quot;What makes you so sure?&quot;
&quot;Because I know I can live with whatever comes next. I&apos;ve prepared with everything I have, I&apos;m unwilling to bow to anything, unless it truly forces me down,&quot; I say.
&quot;Oh, is that so? Then for what reason do you summon me?&quot; She grasps my shoulders, staring directly down at me as I try to meet her gaze, though glancing her eyes feels like staring into the street lamps of Lighttime, leaving a fluorescent glow when my eyelids hinge in protest. &quot;If you&apos;re so certain on your own, then why do you need the help of a Celestial?&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t ask you to crumble their glistening peaks with the strength of your hands. This is our fight: wrought by humans, so it must be solved by us alone. It can&apos;t be won without the costs of loss and casualty. All I ask for is the persuasion of your presence.&quot;
&quot;Then you&apos;ll prove it to me,&quot; she says. Her strength bends to nothing when she takes my right arm in her hand, tracing the mangled, threaded scars with her fingers. &quot;As long as this boon softens the blows of true, one-pointed destiny, you will always be too weak.&quot;
I can feel the anxiety of real death still there, deep inside me. She chides me with a mocking smile. I hear the footfalls of the furious First Red approaching.
&quot;The world is so much greater than this small, forgotten scab of frostbitten dirt. Your whole world is less than a speck on the shores of eternity. Tell me, then, human: when all this is over, if you die before you see the fated end, then what will you have left?&quot;
&quot;Then I&apos;ll have both the ones I love waiting for me on the other side.&quot;
I can swear I see her face flush as a heat flash rises. &quot;But you erased her. You&apos;ve abandoned everyone in those old lives, don&apos;t you understand? What do you have left when no one will remember you?&quot;
&quot;With absolutely nothing? Then all I&apos;ll have is the honor.&quot; I extend my mangled arm to her. If this clears the barrier preventing me from using my birthright, then it&apos;s a wager I have to make.
&quot;You&apos;ve proven yourself worthy, then,&quot; she says, projecting pure energy across my circuits. The tangle of latticed lashes beneath my flesh dances as if worms wriggle beneath my skin. The mangled mess is untangling itself, and before long, a single thread remains.
&quot;But . . . I thought you were taking it away?&quot;
&quot;The Gods of Purgatory have seen far too many of your kind come and pass; demigods absorbed by their selfish visions; promising the world to those who listen when they&apos;re less than dust. I can feel how much you&apos;ve changed this divergent piece of myself called Sylvia. Don&apos;t you remember that you gave her that name?&quot;
The memory is dim, but I know it&apos;s there.
&quot;So I&apos;ll give you a chance, human, because she tells me to believe. You have control of this cursed boon, whether to erase it, or to let it consume you. Sever the thread when the time is right, and with enough Essenced power, you will imbue yourself with the powers of the Mask.&quot;
My hands reach for the thread. &quot;If I&apos;ve decided this is my last chance, then why wouldn&apos;t I do it now?&quot;
&quot;Because the fate you forestalled still has to collect. It is the law of nature. So do you really have what it takes to let go of what you never deserved?&quot;
My stomach twists on all the things I&apos;ve come to possess that I never had before: experiences I&apos;ve stolen.
&quot;In the grand scale of the universe, the breadth of your lifetime is a single breath in the lungs of the Divine. I will grant this small piece of me this life. Just promise me one thing,&quot; the Goddess says, wearing a familiar expression I recognize from the one I love the most.
&quot;Anything.&quot;
&quot;Cherish me in the time you have,&quot; she says, taking my hand as she guides me out the double doors. I can feel the Goddess&apos; rigid grasp taper off as Sylvia regains her heading, the two coalesced as one in divine spirit.
&quot;Your love is burned in my soul, and I will cherish you in every life I&apos;m given, no matter how memory fades with age and rebirth,&quot; I promise her.
The villagers congregate outside the hut, trading their anger for awe as they prostrate in zealous worship.
&quot;Brothers and Sisters of the Carmine: I stand before you today with the prophecy of a certain future. Fletcher has seen every end, and I&apos;ve been the passenger to every outcome. You have a chance, when all the failed realities before you have folded inwards on the avarice of the Afterlife, reaping the souls they&apos;ve sown for Essence by the great Chymaeran weapon Endogeny.&quot;
She floats in the air as her worshippers drink to her celestial presence. Lyra&apos;s eyes are the only ones that focus on me, dumbfounded by the name she&apos;s waited decades to hear again.
&quot;It is time to return. This is your fight to finish, and you carry my will and blessing to stop the Afterlife, before they extinguish the family you hold dear. Hesitate for nothing. Give your lives for the freedom of your people: the true humans whose souls are uncorrupted by golden dreams.&quot;
I can see her celestial charisma fade as Sylvia returns to me, her silver hair darkened as she descends to the ground and into my arms.
&quot;I remembered it,&quot; she tells me. &quot;I could have dissolved away to that other realm. But I want to experience this life here, with you.&quot;
&quot;And I&apos;ll have you for as long as you&apos;ll stay,&quot; I say. &quot;Just please &mdash; hey, what&apos;s wrong?&quot;
&quot;I told you that I remember. It was all so awful!&quot; She says, and her eyes fill with tears as she buries herself in my tattered jacket. &quot;If only I knew how much you suffered just to get here. I wish I could have done more, when you were so alone, just...&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s alright,&quot; I say, as I return Sylvia to her feet. &quot;All that matters is that I&apos;m here now. And&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Fletcher,&quot; Lyra says, standing at the bottom of the steps as she extends her arms. &quot;They thought I was crazy. I was even beginning to lose faith, but...&quot;
&quot;Go spend time with your sister,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;It&apos;s time you get to know her all over again.&quot;"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":3,"AutoNameFull":96,"ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":4,"ChapterFull":45,"ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":96,"Index":146,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"141","Synopsis":"","Summary":"The First Red begins their return to Blackwater.

The First Red spent forty-seven years beyond the walls in the Backwoods, prepared every day to leave at a moment&apos;s notice.
And today was no different.
I steeled myself to persuade them in the vote, siding with Lyra, hoping to use Romin for leverage on Raine, but now they leave in a mass exodus, carrying their lives on their back as we march to the city. 
They&apos;re too afraid to talk to Sylvia, but Valentina walks beside her, unaware she left her hat behind. Behind them, Romin laughs with his father, reminiscing on distant memories of his mother Rose: the last thing they did was pay respects to her grave. And I walk beside Lyra, listening as she tells me stories of a past life I can&apos;t remember.
I tell her of the trials we faced together in another life. She laughs at the times she almost killed me. I feel like I&apos;ve robbed her of these sublime experiences through resetting, though she reassures me that my return to her is all that matters.
The group divides by province at midday, yet an uncountable number of Carmine still trudge towards District Fourteen. The evening settles in the sky though no one is nervous: their Essence potential so great that our pocket of nomadic land becomes bearably cold. When we settle for the night, no fires light the sky. All is pitch black, or else smoke might give away the mass approach.
I rest beside Sylvia, back-to-back with her so neither one of us has to sleep on the ground. By the time the brief lapse of sleep comes to me, the snow has thawed down to dirt, the climate so strangely temperate while snowflakes still sink in the distance. The disappearance of the Amulet still torments me, and the longer I try to reason what changes I sewed intro the fabric of this final effort, the less I feel I know.
&quot;This is the best I can do,&quot; I mutter to myself, long after Sylvia falls asleep on my shoulder. I try to stay awake just to support her&mdash;so that neither of us wake on the cold, hard ground&mdash;but my exhaustion finally comes to nest, sometime after twin moons rise above the silhouetted trees.
I awake to softness on my cheek, and for a minute, I think I&apos;m home. She smiles as my head rests in her lap, brushing the coarse tufts of my jet-black hair so I can see her. She tries to bend down to kiss
me, though something else gets in the way. My face flushes. And just from waking up, I notice there&apos;s a new sapling in the forest.
&quot;Was that my fault?&quot; She asks.
I survey the camp. The sky is still dark, and the early-risers are just waking up. Romin and Valentina are sprawled against a tree, and near them, Raine waits impatiently for his son to wake so they can talk again. The Carmine keep the fires small as daylight crests, just enough  to set a carnivorous odor in the air as they satisfy their hunger, waking the lazy ones to the smell of freshly-grilled meat.
That afternoon, we arrive at an unfamiliar burrow: an abandoned mineshaft whose entrance is no taller than my head, so low that Sylvia and Romin have to duck to fit inside. The single-file path runs hot with sweat for the first hundred yards, until the branch opens to a main tunnel, lit by plumes of fire conjured between the well-trained travelers&apos; palms.
The path runs straight into the city, and just as hunger begins to overtake us, bright blue light marks the opening of a long-forgotten quarry, years etched in the stone that are older than the city by centuries. I&apos;m sure the search of subterranean treasure halted when the Humans found a far greater resource: themselves.
Raine instructs us to disperse as we approach the Compound, and since I&apos;ve acquainted myself with Lyra better than she knew me in past lives, she accompanies our Fireteam to the Compound.
&quot;This is the best I can do,&quot; I mutter to myself again when my allies can&apos;t listen; when I feel the weariness of my body reflect in my weathered soul. I wonder what my mother would say to me in moments like these, and when I remove my mother&apos;s necklace to polish the cold obsidian, I try to imagine what secrets died with her.
We reconvene at the compound around midnight, and the streets are so silent I wonder if Endogeny already cleared them. Hundreds gather in the belly of the Carmine Stronghold, awaiting the moment they spent five decades waiting for. I manage a glance between two Brothers when it opens, and when it does, the thunderous cheers of Carmine tremble the throated hallways like the deep growl of a beast.
I let Romin relish in his moment. Hours later, they&apos;ll be planning their advances, and in less than two days, the assault on the upper lands will begin. To quote Romin, &quot;There&apos;s no chance someone won&apos;t notice all these sweat-soaked, piss-smelling Outwallers.&quot;
I move upstairs to catch an air of silence, and I find Valentina and Sylvia leaning over the balcony of the second floor. Below, the commotion rises as the Carmine prepare themselves for war, trading their cries of jubilee for barks of disciplined order.
The overlook captures the full expanse of the Foothills, casting the three of us in the point of its shadow.

&quot;Titus. Titus,&quot; A familiar voice calls. &quot;You&apos;re here, praise the Gods....&quot;
I turn to find my father&apos;s lone shopkeeper. At her old age, I&apos;m surprised to find her dressed in the robes of the Carmine.
She takes me away from my two friends.
&quot;Maude. What is it?&quot;
She pants for breath after climbing the stairs, barely able to manage the words.
&quot;Your father&apos;s been waiting for you to return,&quot; Maude says. The itching fear I&apos;ve had since leaving returns to me, and I know her next words before she speaks them.
&quot;It&apos;s Ellie.

&quot;You&apos;re in the Carmine. How didn&apos;t I know you were a Sister?&quot; I ask. &quot;I should have seen you at the Compound, at least once, on those days I visited Romin.&quot;
&quot;Because I&apos;m nobody at all. A ghost, Titus, spread so thin between fragments of personality that I forgot who I was to start.&quot; At first I thought it was the sound of keys in her pocket clattering against a ring, but when the dark obsidian in my necklace matches the charms hanging from the metal loop, I know what she&apos;s been this whole time.
&quot;City folk have no idea of what lurks in the shadows. How many of us there really are. And we play our parts with so much conviction because most can&apos;t separate themselves from the lives they overtake.
We&apos;re&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Chymaerans. Half-blood informants, you must be,&quot; I say.
She&apos;s surprised at my quick answer. &quot;But . . . how did you know that? Gods above, did you know the whole time?&quot;
&quot;I only came to know recently. Very recently. I had the chance to meet a few of you,&quot; I say.
&quot;They&apos;ll never tell you. What gave it away?&quot;
&quot;Nothing. They were sent to protect us. Gave us clothes to conceal our identities, so convincing I&apos;d never guess their guises were dead for years.&quot; I play with the pendant between my fingers. &quot;They told me something. They said there was an informant here that might be interested in this.&quot;
She doesn&apos;t have to turn to know what it is. &quot;A guise token. But where did you get it from?&quot;
&quot;From my mother. The First Red Chymaerans were overjoyed when they found it. They insisted it belonged to someone in the city.&quot;
&quot;Well, good luck, kid,&quot; she laughs. For every hundred people, you can bet at least one of them is a Chymaeran. You see all these?&quot; She holds up the ring of charms. &quot;This is a tenth of what I&apos;ve had. I&apos;ve lived and burned hundreds of these guises, given no longer than months for each of them.&quot;
&quot;Then what would cause someone to stay in one guise?&quot; I ask.
She pauses for a moment. &quot;It would take conviction. It would take a feeling of guilt, probably. And after all of it . . . Gods, I remember the faces I wore for months . . . you can still feel fragments of those mannerisms, those personalities, lingering there, long after you burn those connections. The code is &apos;no longer than a month,&apos; or else you&apos;re made.&quot;
I glimpse at the face of every civilian we pass to find their tell, as if I could see their truths so easily. When I give up, I withdraw the clasp from around my neck, pooling the last surviving artifact of the past in my palm.
&quot;My mother cherished this. Maybe you can find its owner,&quot; I tell her. I have no use for it anymore.
&quot;But you value that, son,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s more useful to you than any Chymaeran on the street.&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s time I let go of the past,&quot; I say. And as we approach Clint&apos;s trade building, she sits outside on the three-legged bench, taking the necklace in her hands, trying to discern anything from the energy within.
&quot;Titus, you jackass, why didn&apos;t you come any sooner? Dear Gods above, son! How could you not know?&quot; He shouts. His face is redder than mine after braving the cold. There are spaces on the shelves where antiques are missing. I see small gears, springs, and scraps of wooden debris scattered across the floor.
&quot;I was beyond the walls, Clint! Calm down.&quot;
&quot;You didn&apos;t even see her before you left! She never made it to Seminary. How could you not know something was wrong?&quot; He strains his fingers against the fabric of my shirt, because I&apos;m too big now for him to do anything else.
&quot;Her bag was gone, Dad. She ate breakfast. Her window was closed. I thought she left early!&quot;
&quot;You bastard. Your laziness jeopardizes everything, can&apos;t you see that? If you&apos;d just try&mdash;&quot;
<em>Like you do? </em>I almost say, but realize it&apos;s not worth it. His hand trembles as he waits for a response. His greyed hair is disheveled, and I can tell he hasn&apos;t showered since he realized she was missing.
&quot;When did you find this out?&quot; I say, trying to level my voice.
&quot;It was . . . two days ago. And I&apos;ve tried everything,&quot; Clint says.
&quot;The day after I left?&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;And I would have known earlier if you didn&apos;t take so damn long! I didn&apos;t realize until the nanny you hired couldn&apos;t find her. Gods, and that was two days after it happened. She must have run  away, Titus. I know she&apos;s sick of our feuding. So lonely, even.&quot;
But he can&apos;t handle his part of the blame.
&quot;If only you signed that damn form, son, she&apos;d&apos;ve had a chance at a better life!&quot;
&quot;You&apos;re right,&quot; I say.
&quot;No, I know I&apos;m right. If you just...&quot; He pauses. &quot;Wait. What did you say?&quot;
&quot;You&apos;re right. There&apos;s so much more she deserves than what we could both give her. We were too distracted: so busy with our grief and our obsessions that we never really listened.&quot;
&quot;And now she&apos;s gone, Titus! The City Guard report nothing, I&apos;ve checked over and over, and she&apos;s probably frozen somewhere. Dear Gods, Titus, if your mother were still here, things would be so different. I wouldn&apos;t give you so many reasons to hate me,&quot; he says.
&quot;I don&apos;t hate you. You&apos;re my father. You taught me how to swing a sword, and though we disagree, that doesn&apos;t detract from the reasons I&apos;m thankful.&quot;
&quot;Don&apos;t spite me, son. I don&apos;t deserve your thanks. This stupid shop. And Moira! I see that picture, and every time I hate myself more, knowing what I leave behind. when I know how long it&apos;s been that I&apos;ve waddled in this addiction.&quot;
&quot;And I&apos;m my father&apos;s son,&quot; I say. &quot;We&apos;re going to find her. Because if she has even a tenth of our resilient spirit, she&apos;ll survive anything.&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he musters. &quot;Yeah. We can&apos;t give up.&quot; He picks up an ancient metal tea set, brushing it off before he notices the large dent in the other side. I stoop down to help him.
I leave ten minutes later. Maude is gone by the time I return to the Compound, along with the necklace, and all I can think of is the final promise I made to Ellie: how reassured I feel that I don&apos;t have to handle the unforgivable &mdash; or at least not until I see her again."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":98,"ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":5,"ChapterFull":46,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":98,"Index":149,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"144","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Romin, Lyra, and Titus stakeout the trade building.

&quot;Dear Gods, and our kids have no idea what&apos;s going to happen,&quot; Romin says, crouching beside me as we watch from a pile of rubble behind the warehouse.
&quot;And under what pretense do they force themselves in?&quot; Lyra asks.
&quot;That the kids are out past curfew. They knock on the door, because all kids see is just authority, not politics or ulterior motives, and then...&quot; I remember that horrific sight from the time I didn&apos;t know.
Romin says, &quot;I&apos;m hinging this whole operation on your hunch, so you better be gods-damn sure you&apos;re right. This is my chance.&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s going to happen,&quot; I say. But after all that&apos;s changed, the words almost hang in a question, and when Romin looks back at me, I make sure my face is resolute.
Whatever force of fate that fights me can&apos;t possibly know that I&apos;ve <em>everything right, and the Gods are on my side, so it has to be! </em>I look down at the lone scar on my arm until I can hone my feelings of righteousness into surrogate truth.
&quot;You&apos;re sure? You&apos;re absolutely sure, Titus?&quot; Romin asks.
And then he gets his answer.
When he looks back, a First Red Sister conjures two faint flares of fire while she leans against the side of the building.
&quot;Something&apos;s going on,&quot; Romin says. &quot;She&apos;s not sure yet.&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s about that time,&quot; I say. But the first time I wasn&apos;t there, and the second I was so far underground that light couldn&apos;t tell me the hour. I can still feel it&apos;s going to happen.
Two more faint pops of light.
&quot;Still not sure. But they&apos;re approaching.&quot; He motions for Lyra and I to move up. Ahead, my eyes can barely pick up on several of the First Red in their transparent, Chymaeran-scaled cloaks, steadied with axerifles, ready to blast a hole in anything that gets too close. And then the scouting Sister retreats.
&quot;Yeah. Whoever it is, they&apos;re definitely heading for the door. Lyra. Signal the Guise,&quot; Romin says, unable to conjure anything from empty circuits.
Lyra swipes her hands across the air. A line burns my retinas, and once I see through it, the two half-blood Chymaerans that guised my friends in a future past take the form of Merlotan city guardsmen.
&quot;I wouldn&apos;t have gone for this. Those bastards deserve to die, but if you can make me eat my words-&quot; Romin says.
They emerge from the right side of the property. One smokes a  false cigar conjured from whatever fabric their guises take on, and when the Merlotan impostors come into view, they hail them.
We get closer when they&apos;re distracted. I can hear the kids now, inside, dragging boxes and laughing at an innocent joke. And when I slide across the wall, I can barely make out their conversation.
&quot;Disturbance call. Made by the fella across the street.&quot; He points at Clint in his shop.
&quot;Please. Disturbing what? The position of some poor crates?&quot; our Guise says.
&quot;You know how this works. Just so we can write it off on the paperwork,&quot; the Merlotan says. &quot;Three&apos;s enough but five&apos;s a crowd, so piss off somewhere else, will ya?&quot;
&quot;There&apos;s been a heavy hand on Carmine children for ages. We&apos;re not leaving. So do your business and get it done,&quot; the Guise says.
I find that same primal look of resigned panic in the guards&apos; faces, the one those fake social workers had when they were on edge. Romin notices it too. But when his hand unbuttons the holsters, I halt him.
&quot;I know your trigger finger itches for action, but this will work out. Trust me. Just watch: they&apos;re just beginning to realize they can&apos;t do anything.&quot;
&quot;Well, I remember something about caged animals,&quot; Romin says.
&quot;No witnesses, Romin. This has to happen inside the building. They can&apos;t have any reason to think anything happened to them when they came here.&quot;
I can feel the disdain in challenging his authority. But he can live with it. I&apos;m swayed stronger by my vow to see this life through on a single chance.
The door hinges shut, and as we hold our baited breaths in silence, we listen, as an eternity drags on far too long, longer and longer, waiting for a voice, a sound, anything to give us a hint of what&apos;s going on inside while the rest of the Carmine stir uncomfortably around us, the basement team somewhere beneath the ground, waiting behind the same door I hesitated at, waiting for the signal, while Romin twitches in bitter anxiety, hoping something will just happen so he can get it over with, and as soon find I feel the same way, though I have the courage to weather the storm.
&quot;You don&apos;t run this,&quot; he suddenly says. &quot;I run this.&quot; His hand gravitates towards the axe-rifle, but he still finds that sense of hesitation.
It&apos;s only when we hear a loud crash that Romin lurches to action. I can hardly stop him when the shrill whistle rises in his throat. The sound halts when I squeeze his shoulder.
&quot;Trust me, Romin. Not yet!&quot;
&quot;No, Titus! They follow my orders, not yours.&quot;
&quot;I know. But trust your crew. We need those faces in there. They&apos;re gonna save those kids.&quot;
He groans hoarsely, only allowing an anguished whisper. He looks down into my eyes to see if I withhold my conviction, but I refuse. I can see that strain for power so close he can almost grasp it, because I saw it on the hill when he led those innocent young cadets to die.
&quot;You&apos;ve always been strong, Romin. You have nothing more to prove.&quot;
I can see his nails bite into his fists. It takes a moment before he lets his itching pulse of energy off with a shiver.
Lyra joins me. &quot;The Carmine are now stronger than they ever were before. None of them can anticipate our allied Chymaerans. Don&apos;t doubt our power.&quot;
Romin&apos;s hand raises in the air, and he clenches it in a fist. I can see his fingers almost hinge out with the signal to move before he gives in. &quot;Fine, then. We&apos;ll wait a little longer, but I swear . . .&quot; I can see how badly he itches for action, to be the one that got them, to bring it all home to his father.
I rest my hand on his shoulder. We lean further against the wall, and I peek into the windows of the cellar. Somewhere, I can overhear the faint commotion, and then a door opens in the basement, followed by light footsteps.
I can see the door crack open as the children descend the stairs.
Romin realizes what holds my focus and he watches with me, and a sigh of relief overtakes him. Between the kids, six figures stand past the doorframe in disguise. The only difference is, four don&apos;t know that the other two are playing the part better than they are.
It&apos;s when the last cadet crosses the doorframe that the Merlotan grabs him, pulling him backwards and slamming the door. The children cry out in panic, and it&apos;s then that Romin bashes himself through the window, the glass tinkling across the hard concrete of the unfinished basement as his feet plant on the floor.
Lyra and I follow right after him, and we realize we can&apos;t catch up. I can see the anger rise inside of him as he passes the survivors, taking three stairs at a time until his hand crumpled the brass doorknob,
tearing it off the wood as he throws the door open. He halts there, absorbing all the light of the main room, and when we get to the top of the stairs to look around him, we find the child lying there in a small pool of blood.
&quot;We were too late,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;We saved as many as we could, but &mdash;&quot;
Romin bends his knees to reach down and lift the young cadet, still breathing though they cry in anguish.
&quot;You&apos;re going to be okay,&quot; he says. I think he&apos;s just comforting the doomed until I realize he&apos;s telling the truth. The child has hardly a slice on his arm, just startled of the sight that I&apos;m finally able to process.
The blood is from those bastards of the Afterlife. They never expected expertly-trained half-bloods to carve them up, and they sprawl across the floor as their dark blood pools together across the wood.
&quot;It&apos;s Jeremy, right,&quot; Romin says, and the kid nods. &quot;That was really scary, I know&mdash;but you were real tough, buddy,&quot; he says, and the child smiles.
&quot;I&apos;m tough,&quot; the child repeats, though they still tremble, snot and tears caked on their face as Romin wipes it off with his fresh cloak.
&quot;One day, sir, I&apos;ll be strong just like you!&quot;
&quot;You will be,&quot; Romin says. &quot;I&apos;m proud of you.&quot;
He turns his back to the sight of the massacre as the Chymaerans dig out bones to make fresh Markers. They&apos;ll have to be quick to make this exchange convincing.
Less than five minutes later, we watch from the darkness as the first flames crackle the aged wood like an orange hand reaching out from inside the building, cramping its fingers on every window until it squeezes enough to bring the whole building down."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":3,"AutoNameFull":99,"ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":5,"ChapterFull":46,"ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":99,"Index":150,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"145","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Titus returns home to find Sylvia there, and they sleep in the house.

Sylvia shivers on the porch alone as I climb the steps.
&quot;You didn&apos;t have to wait out here, you know,&quot; I tell her. &quot;You should know by now where I keep the spare key. It&apos;s the same place Moira hid it for years.&quot; But when I reach for the porch&apos;s cross beam, barely able to drag my fingers across the splintered surface, Sylvia dangles it from between her fingers.
&quot;I just didn&apos;t want to scare you, or give you some kind of false hope that your sister was back.&quot; She leans into me. Her cold skin sucks the warmth from me as I fumble the key into the lock, and when I twist the knob, a wall of warm air buffets us.
The door&apos;s shut before we can strip our jackets, and our boots condensate the warped wood floor, worn from years of neglect. The house is far too big for the two of us, especially at night, the way it creaks from the cold just to break the silence; how the dust highlights all the unused spaces a fuller family might have used; and it&apos;s no wonder Ellie slept every night with her door shut to ward off that overwhelming feeling, or else it might leak through.
My bare feet crunch into the stiff carpet, and with a layer less, I can feel how cold this space still is. I feed a couple logs into the fireplace, crumpling ages-old newspapers from the Merlotan Bulletin to ignite with Clint&apos;s old lighter resting on the mantle. Sylvia grabs the blanket Moira wove with Ellie, and my sister&apos;s unfinished strands tangle on Sylvia&apos;s bracelet when she tries to wrap it around her.
The smell of lavender is absent when my nose adjusts, though after all this time I still find that I expect it.
Sylvia&apos;s eyes feather shut on exhaustion until I speak. &quot;I guess I could never make it like it was, no matter how hard I tried. For her. Just to make it a fraction as close as it used to be. I hired a maid for a while, then a caretaker. I gave them my mother&apos;s cookbook. I got the same scents she used to light. Once I even smoked on the porch, just to waft in the stink of Clint&apos;s tobacco, but no matter how hard so tried, it never broke that sense of disbelief.&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s just a feeling you know without thinking. A habit, maybe. When it&apos;s dark in my room, the blinds are drawn, and the window is open, sometimes I awake still thinking I&apos;m in that small bed at the orphanage.&quot;
&quot;We played on this carpet as kids. A decade and a half away, and no more than an arm&apos;s reach from where the toy box was,&quot; I tell her. &quot;I used to think it was just time that separates us. But the further I get from home, and the less time I have, the more it feels like it&apos;s something greater than that.&quot;
The polished tables are the only preserved piece in all the house. The drapes are faded from cycles of lighttime. So much furniture was gouged from this house at the estate sale, and I had to fight just to keep the tattered red couch I slept on while Clint read the news.
The same words he read back then float from the printed pages of kindling on glowing embers, cracking and popping like punctuation as strings of sentences dissociate to thoughtless smoke, never to be arranged in the same order again by either accident or intention.
&quot;I wish I could hold on to this moment,&quot; I tell her. But she&apos;s already asleep: cuddled up to my arm the same way she did when we were kids, and silently, I wonder how many days it will take until this house is leveled like all the others, and without a reason to keep this roof above anyone&apos;s head, I find the attachment is no longer there. Maybe through all these lives, home has become something else &mdash; because I can still feel the heat while I fall asleep, without a corner of Sylvia&apos;s blanket.
I expect we&apos;ll sleep the whole morning away in the empty house, but the faint hum of something mechanical wakes me from beyond the window, chattering the glass. A lone girl stands on the porch, dressed in the fine garments of Merlotan prestige, and at first I don&apos;t recognize her without the hat.
&quot;Valentina?&quot; I ask, using the doorframe in lieu of a shirt. &quot;What&apos;s going on?&quot;
I see familiar garments in her hands: ones worn by the impostors the night before, still saturated in dried blood. &quot;So Romin had an idea, and he told me to find people I can trust.&quot;
&quot;You came to the right place. Maybe the timing was a little . . .&quot; a yawn punctuates my sentence for me.
&quot;Come with me, please,&quot; she asks. &quot;I don&apos;t have the strength to go it alone.&quot;
&quot;Of course. But I don&apos;t have any clothes here &mdash; Gods forbid the only formal thing I have left in a box somewhere is my seminary uniform. And Sylvia,&quot; I look to her still sleeping on the arm of the couch, &quot;well . . . she&apos;s got all the dresses you gave her at the Academy loft.&quot;
She reaches behind her to unfold a triple-folded leather bag. &quot;I came prepared because I knew your answer.&quot;
I laugh.&quot;No way. Is that . . . really?&quot;
&quot;Yeah. Unworn, too. Five years ago, Romin and I were going to a big Merlot event. Well, you went to that party yesterday, and we don&apos;t even call that formal,&quot; she says. &quot;I got this made for him so he wouldn&apos;t stand out too much, but he hated it: went in his Carmine Reds, and I couldn&apos;t distance myself enough from him after he drank a barrel dry.&quot;
&quot;I guess I&apos;ll wear it then,&quot; I say.
&quot;Always the center of attention, Romin is, like he&apos;s trying to prove something. But this time is different.&quot;
&quot;He&apos;s changed, just a little bit,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;I guess so,&quot; she says. &quot;Anyways. You two get dressed now, we need to head up there.&quot;
I look past her, squinting at the blood-red color of the touring car, far louder than the reserved, muted color of wine I expected. 
&quot;And we&apos;re going there in <em>that</em>?&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t mind,&quot; she says, &quot;plus &mdash; this is a rare time we should take after Romin. &apos;Loud&apos; is exactly what we need.&quot;

Somewhere a quarter mile past us, the guards make out a cherry-red blip in the distance, squinting to try and tell whether the bright red is just an illusion in the muted fog of lighttime.
It should be dull and reserved like the banter at their parties: far from interesting, yet dressed in gold and far over-the-top. It&apos;s isn&apos;t until a hundred feet and closing that they raise their rifles to the hard-topped motorcar embellished with the crest of the Carmine.
&quot;In the name of the Upper Gods, stop your carriage!&quot; They yell. But Valentina keeps the speed of the motorcar steady. &quot;Are you sure about this?&quot; Sylvia asks, sitting next to me in the back.
&quot;We should slow down,&quot; I add, grasping the seat in front of me to brace myself.
&quot;By Gods above, loud I said. I meant it!&quot; Valentina orders.&quot;This is a message. They won&apos;t get out of the house for me through diplomacy. Trust me &mdash; I&apos;ve tried it so many times.&quot;
&quot;Then what about the plan? Why are we dressed up?&quot; I ask her.
&quot;Change of plans. Now get ready.&quot;
I brace myself on the leather-bound seat in front of me, reaching my arm out to protect Sylvia. A loud crack erupts in the distance, and once the second one snaps the air, I realize they&apos;re taking potshots at us.
&quot;Keep driving,&quot; Valentina insists. &quot;Pedal to the floor!&quot;
We&apos;re a stone&apos;s throw away when the third gunshot shatters through the window, through the front window glass, the front headrest, back headrest, and rear linoleum cover. We&apos;re so close I can hear the chamber load as two of them jump to the side, just as a third round blasts the tire, letting off a loud pop, chattering the car along on its axle like a train on overheated rails.
My trimmed nails try to dig into the headrest. My toes curl in my boots, and all my muscles tighten, though I can&apos;t decide whether or not I should go limp. The gate is grand and expensive, and after the last of the four desperate Merlotan guards dive out of the way, I scream with everything I have in me, maybe even louder than Sylvia.
The motorcar bludgeons the expensive golden gate open, bending the latticed, floral curvatures until they snap. The violent impact lays Valentina&apos;s chest into the horn, bashing it in so far it sounds even when she withdraws. Without power, the motorcar chatters along the muddy ground a bit longer, swerving on the missing front right tire until the spoke wheel sinks into the ground. We feel the center-of-mass shift to the missing tire, and with the speed so suddenly brought to a halt by a boulder, the car flips about its front until the hard-top becomes a softtop.
I&apos;m dazed and disoriented, but we&apos;re fortunate that we find no blood.
&quot;They&apos;re going to kill us now, Valentina!&quot; Sylvia tells her, as she sprawls across the jagged roof-now-floor.
But she&apos;s laughing. &quot;Ever since three years ago, they never let me through that Gods-damn gate, and I had to crawl through the drainage pipe to get to that cellar. Do you know how long I&apos;ve dreamt of this?&quot;
I unbuckle the seat belt and lower myself to the crumpled steel roof, careful not to cut myself on the frayed edges.
&quot;Romin&apos;s not going to be happy,&quot; I say, as I orient my legs to kick out the glass.
&quot;Love, he&apos;s totaled two of mine already. So I think he owes me,&quot; she says.
I ramble something about rich people when the heel of my boot strikes the glass. It&apos;s a miracle this vehicle kept itself together enough: any faster and it&apos;s own weight would have flattened us. There are at least twelve pairs of boots past the window by the time we try to escape, some the fatigues of the Merlotan guards, though most of them are startled groundskeepers, green stained on the knees of their trousers and work-gloves.
&quot;Get out and put your hands up! No, behind your back!&quot; a young guard shouts. His voice cracks. &quot;Stand up slowly. On your knees. Legs crossed.&quot; I emerge first, with Romin&apos;s fresh formal wear stained with dirt and oil as I sprawl on the ground, their rifles aimed at my head, one gardener poised to attack with a set of hedge clippers as if he&apos;ll cut my head off. They gasp when Valentina comes out next, perfect hair disheveled, her secret features twitching with the commotion all around her.
&quot;No excuses. No telling me I&apos;m an unwelcome guest in my own home. No offers to drive me back to the Academy or shepherd me to the cellar or any of that disgusting neglect you&apos;re all passive to. You have no choice. Now you <em>have </em>to bring us to them,&quot; she says.
The staff are too uncomfortable to raise their weapons at a Vermillion, let alone her associates. All they can do is prevent us from leaving, which we don&apos;t intend to do anyway, and so we walk together towards the main house.
A tall woman approaches, holding a child as she stumbles through the grass in heels, careful to not let her insular, white fur coat touch the dirt.
&quot;Gods above us, what is this vociferous racket?&quot; She locks eyes with Valentina. &quot;You Gods-damn weasel! What are you doing here?
What did you do to my gate?&quot;
&quot;I had to get your attention, Victoria,&quot; she says. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t let me in otherwise. And all Vincent can ever do is be complacent.&quot;
&quot;Nothing you do could ever be worth my time,&quot; she says, stroking little Vanna&apos;s hair from her eyes as Vanna sucks her thumb. &quot;You have your damn audience, only because you&apos;re going to be fixing that yourself with your own sweat and blood.&quot;
&quot;I only had to break the gate because you never let me in!&quot;
Victoria strikes Valentina&apos;s face with her free hand, enough to stagger her, and I catch her before she has a chance to fall.
&quot;You&apos;re only a lowly leech, child,&quot; she says, refusing to even look at her, and Valentina cowers, struggling to meet her stepmother&apos;s eyes as she rubs her cheek. &quot;You&apos;re not a Vermillion. Nor will you ever fully be with your tainted blood, so don&apos;t think you&apos;re entitled.&quot; Her tone is muted, stating her truth as if fact.
Vanna begins to cry, and when Victoria consoles her, I clench Valentina&apos;s arm to goad her to continue. But she&apos;s silent, trying to fight back tears though they well in her eyes.
&quot;Oh, I&apos;m sorry, baby. Mother has unwanted guests. They&apos;ll be leaving,&quot; Victoria says. But Vanna reaches out her arms, reacting to her half-sister&apos;s change in emotion.
&quot;Ally! Ally,&quot; she says, and though Victoria tries to reconcile any other reason she weeps, she has no choice. After a minute, she allows Vanna to slip into Valentina&apos;s arms.
Victoria sighs. She covers Valentina&apos;s disgraceful abomination with her hat. &quot;Follow.&quot;
Sylvia takes Valentina&apos;s hand and I follow right behind them, ushered by guards that, even with weapons, have nowhere near that icy ferocity. Victoria stumbles several times before cutting onto the well-manicured sidewalk snaking up to the mansion, and we follow her, as Valentina copes with her crippling anxiety and tries to piece together the words before it&apos;s too late.
I give the bloodstained Merlotan garments to Valentina, the evidence still far more sullied than our formal wear. &quot;Remember what we&apos;re here for. You&apos;re not alone,&quot; I tell her, and as we approach the main house, several flaxen-blonde-haired figures watch from the third story window.
&quot;Dote on your sister while you still can, because it will be the last time you&apos;ll see her after Vincent is done with you,&quot; Victoria says. The grand doors open and we step inside, and even with all its servants, the house feels so empty without a cause for celebration. Valentina puts down Vanna, telling her to &quot;go play&quot; so she doesn&apos;t have to witness what comes next, but she grasps the edge of Valentina&apos;s skirt, and it makes me miss Ellie.
&quot;No!&quot; Vanna exclaims.
&quot;You can&apos;t come with us,&quot; Valentina says, getting down on one
knee. &quot;This might be the last time I&apos;ll ever see you. Maybe when you&apos;re older, I&apos;ll have the chance see you again, but...&quot;
Vanna just stares at her, unaware of the meaning though she understands the feeling. She runs off into the adjoining room where her toys are strewn about, and so the guards usher us up the grand, marble foyer stairs embossed with a great, golden &quot;V&quot;."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":101,"ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":6,"ChapterFull":47,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":101,"Index":153,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"148","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Valentina provides proof, wagering her place in the Vermillion family.

<em>Dear Gods, they must have only stopped having kids because they ran out of </em>&quot;<em>V</em>&quot;<em> names,</em> I think to myself, but I don&apos;t dare speak the thought aloud. Vera and Virgil accompany Valentina. I can feel how their mother&apos;s spite poisons them with secondhand squalor, their panic over the situation as if shepherding the damned to execution.
&quot;Sissy, why are you here? What happened?&quot; young Virgil asks, as Vera thanks the Gods she isn&apos;t in her sister&apos;s shoes. The caretakers are vacant on the upper floors; they flooded out as soon as they heard the doors and saw the cat-eared bastard child enter. Valentina&apos;s manicured nails bite the flesh on her palms though Sylvia and Vera try to console her.
&quot;It&apos;s going to be fine, Val,&quot; Vera insists. &quot;I&apos;ll talk to them. I&apos;ll do whatever it takes, just hang in there.&quot;
Valentina&apos;s voice wavers. &quot;This is pretty irreversible, dear, but it&apos;s alright &mdash; because I think I learned something. For all these years, I never realized I was so much more than my name.&quot;
&quot;No. Valentina, please don&apos;t burn this bridge. You&apos;re saying you&apos;re willing to&mdash;&quot;
&quot;I already bashed a gate in, love. I won&apos;t try burning anything, but a bridge isn&apos;t too much more.&quot;
His chair turns from the window when we enter, and a balding, mustached man sits behind an embossed mahogany desk. He seems so much smaller than I imagined, with such a large chair and a vacuous, high-ceiling office. Maybe it&apos;s the look of fear and confusion in his eyes when Victoria drags his daughter in.
&quot;You know what this . . . outsider . . . and her associates did to your gate? Did you see what happened?&quot;
He twirls the ink pen between his fingers. &quot;No. What did they do?&quot;
&quot;They smashed it open. With a car! These intruders.&quot;
Vincent cringes at the word. Instead of making any effort to correct her, he crumples further in his chair, serving whatever words might appease his wife. &quot;And what do you propose we do?&quot;
Victoria turns so she can watch Valentina&apos;s face twist on her next words. &quot;Virgil, Vera, this is no place for you right now, children. Run along.&quot; Virgil hides behind the doorframe though Vera lingers.
&quot;What you say to my sister, you can say in front of all of us,&quot; Vera says. &quot;And, Gods above, Vince, are you going to let her talk like that about your daughter?&quot;
He opens his mouth to speak, but is cut short by Victoria.
&quot;You dare stoop to her level?&quot;
&quot;She&apos;s my sister,&quot; Vera says, stepping foot into the massive study.
&quot;She&apos;s an interloper. And she has no more future with us. We gave her sustenance to leech from us. We let her stay in the cellar with the rats, though this cockroach persisted to tarnish our property with her putrefied presence,&quot; she says, spitting every letter. &quot;We should have the Royal Guard noose her up after we drag her from the lift!&quot;
&quot;Well. It&apos;s just a gate,&quot; Vince mutters.
&quot;And she&apos;s just a bloody-damn criminal threatening our family&apos;s safety. Wouldn&apos;t you do anything to protect us?&quot;
Mild-mannered Sylvia looks like she wants to tell them off, but I tighten my hand around her wrist. <em>This is not our fight. Our words will only discredit Valentina</em>&apos;<em>s inner strength. </em>All we can do is just be here, in this moment.
And so Valentina removes her mother&apos;s hat from her head, causing Vince to look away and Victoria&apos;s anger to rise further.
&quot;I think you&apos;ve said quite enough, Mother,&quot; she says. &quot;So many years you&apos;ve abused me. I remember standing here in this office when it was just you and me, almost ten years ago. You left a hacksaw from the tool shed on the floor, don&apos;t you remember? Without a word? And I knew what you wanted me to do, and I complied, and you relished in every moment of my suffering.&quot; She rubs the space between her back and rear. &quot;You let me bleed until I passed out from the shock, and only then, did you let the caretakers tend to my self-inflicted wounds.&quot;
Sylvia&apos;s mouth hangs agape. And it seems that not even Vera knew the secret truth of her sister. 
&quot;Gods above, Val,&quot; I whisper, but Victoria cuts in. 
&quot;And I should have-&quot;
&quot;Neglected me every day I lived here, turning my life into misery, all while Vincent turns a blind eye to everything, digging deeper into the Merlot so he can see me even less and forget the daughter he used to love when he was allowed to.&quot; Her voice trembles with such rage and righteous conviction. She pauses to calmly draw the words like an archer. &quot;So if you want to release me from your burdens, to stop me leeching from the rightful blood I share of this family, then grant me one final request, and I will change my name and never return.&quot;
&quot;No, Val, please,&quot; Vera says. &quot;Vince, she&apos;s your daughter! You can&apos;t let this happen . . . don&apos;t you have any love in your heart for her besides your cowardice?&quot;
&quot;I . . . I think&mdash;&quot; Vince looks first to Victoria before looking at his daughter. &quot;I think we&apos;ll hear her out.&quot;
&quot;She should get nothing. Send her off with nothing. You know you can,&quot; Victoria says.
&quot;I will hear her out,&quot; he says, standing up from his chair, only to find out his stature is taller than all of us.
&quot;I know this drama exhausts you. But I have only one request.&quot; Valentina turns to me before she speaks, as if to check that I really believe in this gambit. &quot;Don&apos;t go to the celebration at the Afterlife.&quot;
Vince, Victoria, and Vera let out an audible grunt of confusion. They expected hush money, buyout from the Academy, anything else than what she offers, so much that it leads them all to laughter.
&quot;You don&apos;t want us to go to a . . . party? That&apos;s it? That&apos;s preposterous!&quot;
&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; Valentina says.
&quot;But why?&quot; asks Vincent.
&quot;Because I forgive you. And though you might not love me the way I love you, I still want you to live.&quot;
&quot;You&apos;re not making any sense,&quot; Victoria says, &quot;is that a threat?&quot;
&quot;Check beneath the lift you said you&apos;d drag me from. The Afterlife conspires to wipe out every family of the Merlot. They never wanted you to get to the top in the first place.&quot;
&quot;The Vermillion Merlot are a faithful conduit of both worship and stability. What you say is just obfuscating slander,&quot; Victoria says.
&quot;Then check beneath the lift. Write me off with nothing, I don&apos;t care anymore,&quot; Valentina says, &quot;but you&apos;ll regret it if you don&apos;t look.&quot;
Victoria calls to one of the house&apos;s stewards, and demands they assemble a team to go and look. We stand in silence for nearly thirty minutes. It&apos;s long enough that the anxiety begins to crawl into my mind, worrying about how much has changed, if after all this time my prophetic visions have left Valentina out to dry.
&quot;How would you know this? Did you plant it there, just to save the day, to prove a point?&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t have access. You lock the doors of the cellar so I can only come through the drainage tunnel. In Khiras&apos; name, I had to smash a car through the gate just to get in!&quot;
&quot;Well you better hope you&apos;re right,&quot; Victoria says, as Vince and Vera approach the window. A commotion travels up the stairs, getting louder as it climbs from level to level, and somewhere beyond the window, the cooks and custodians flood out of the house onto the back lawn. The nervous cadet from earlier breaks the doorway with a steel weldment in his hands, and I recognize the etchings on the side from the debris that crushed Valentina.
&quot;Found it.&quot;
The sight startles all of us. Victoria nearly falls over the desk to use Vincent as a blast shield.
&quot;You imbecile, you brought that . . . thing . . . into our home?&quot; Victoria asks.
&quot;It&apos;s inactive,&quot; he says. &quot;The detonator line was attached. It would have started several moments after you activated the lift, but now it&apos;s just a brick of Essence,&quot; he says, tossing the heavy container in his hands before he drops it on the floor, giving everyone a start as Vince nearly flips over the desk.
&quot;I should have you fired, boy!&quot; Vince says.
&quot;I&apos;m sorry. Very sorry,&quot; he replies, cradling the improvised explosive like a child now.
&quot;Well, who planted it, then?&quot; Vera asks. Vince nervously approaches, making the brick look small as he turns it over in his large hands.
&quot;I deal with trading a lot of what this province produces. This is high-carbon steel. No witness marks. Far too nice for an improvised dirty bomb by the Carmine, yet it looks just like what they might try to make.&quot;
&quot;And all the Essence in there, mixed with saltpeter. Do the Carmine even have that much dead Essence to throw away like this?&quot;
Valentina withdraws her tattered bag that survived the crash. &quot;And now that you&apos;re beginning to discover the nature of who did this . . . here&apos;s the tattered uniforms of four impostors using your name to try to kill Carmine children.&quot; She places them across the desk: the details indistinguishable from our district&apos;a Merlotan City Guard. &quot;They were trying to start a street war. But we stopped them first.&quot;
Vera asks, &quot;And this &apos;they&apos; is . . .&quot;
&quot;The Afterlife,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;Their final mission was never about stability. It&apos;s to harvest their field of souls as crops &mdash; whether loyal or indifferent &mdash; to bring back the glory of another golden age. All they see is as is Essence.&quot;
&quot;Pray tell, and in this theory, what would they get by destroying us?&quot; Victoria asks.
&quot;The instability they need to wipe us out completely, while we&apos;re too busy fighting each other.&quot; Valentina nods to me. I rehearsed these words with her before, preparing for diplomacy that didn&apos;t involve destroying property. I made the choice to believe in her, and I&apos;m proud of her.
Vince sets down the dormant explosive, commanding one of his attendants to take it far away. &quot;Thank you. Daughter,&quot; he says.
The words don&apos;t do much for Valentina, but she nods. Victoria is still too distraught with surprise to react.
&quot;The Carmine are aware of this farce, too,&quot; Valentina tells them. &quot;They hold an open table with your seats in place. Stay too much longer here &mdash; don&apos;t take that lift &mdash; and the Afterlife will wonder how you got the best of them. Take the lift without the explosive, and they&apos;ll find another way to do the job.&quot;
&quot;So what are you saying, daughter?&quot; Vince asks.
&quot;I&apos;m saying the enemy of your enemy might be the only friend you have now,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;And they&apos;re waiting for you.&quot;

We approach in the third car of twelve in what&apos;s a sight for the ages. Frightened onlookers duck out of their windows when the muted Merlotan red reflects up at them off the hood of the motorcars, embossed with the bright letter &quot;V&quot; in gold on each of them, thinking war is about to unfold on the streets.
The driver crimps her white gloves on the steering wheel while the man riding shotgun stays true to its name, as if they&apos;ve never delved into the middle-lower-class slums of Blackwater before. And when the entourage finally makes it to the Carmine Compound, the cars leave a single set of tracks as they circle in the frozen mud of the front lot.
Beyond the doors of the motorcar, the Brothers and Sisters look on with caution: sharing silence with the onlookers from the street, since any words might catch and flare. The doors all open at the same time, except for one, and the Merlotan Guard and Royal Guardsmen emerge, staggered green and red.
The Vermillion patriarch is the last to emerge, just as Romin and his father part the crowd of Carmine to greet their unlikely guests. Even the snow halts itself somewhere above the smog, waiting for the two estranged men to make contact.
&quot;Vincent,&quot; Raine says, extending his hand.
Vincent wipes his hand with a handkerchief, shelving his look of disgust for the ragged landscape before clasping Raine&apos;s hand. &quot;It&apos;s been a long time. I see Romin there. And I heard you were out in the woods for a while. How&apos;s Ruby?&quot;
&quot;Ruby?&quot; Raine asks.
&quot;Your wife,&quot; Vincent says, wiping his hand again. &quot;And Ryder?&quot;
&quot;My wife was Rose. They&apos;re both dead&mdash; though it&apos;s nice to see your family&apos;s taking good care of each other.&quot;
Vincent looks up. &quot;Ah. Well, it&apos;s a lovely statue, at least, made from Merlotan bronze and all.&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s as new to you as it is to me. But anyways,&quot; Raine says. &quot;You&apos;re in my compound.&quot;
&quot;I am. It&apos;s a common enemy that aligns our interests. Us Merlot would handle this ourselves if we had a little more strength.&quot;
&quot;Surely you could,&quot; Raine says, before Romin nudges him. &quot;You could, of course, but we&apos;re glad we can split the same burden.&quot;
Romin stands beside Valentina as Vincent turns to address us. &quot;It was our children that brought us together in a way we thought was impossible. We found a fake explosive beneath the lift that would have killed us. It looked like one of yours, but we trust that&apos;s not possible.&quot;
&quot;We wouldn&apos;t do anything like that unless we were provoked,&quot; Raine says.
 &quot;I hope not. And so you&apos;ve had an incident?&quot;
&quot;An incident.&quot; Raine chews the flavorless words. &quot;Our incident was that attackers trying to kill innocent children in one of our storehouses, disguised as your people.&quot;
&quot;Which we would never do either, unless...&quot;
&quot;Provoked?&quot; Raine asks.
&quot;Oh, please. You don&apos;t get provoked when you carry the big stick,&quot; Vince says.
&quot;Then I&apos;m curious why you think you need our help. Since you&apos;re provoked by someone else with a bigger stick.&quot; Raine&apos;s hands grasp the collar of his vest, exposing his thick, corded musculature. &quot;Maybe we have better experience living with discomfort?&quot;
&quot;Providing food and utilities to a whole province is far from comfortable, Raine. Please, if you just&mdash;&quot;
The last car door bashes open, and Victoria stomps out, having rested her legs from all the walking. &quot;Gods above, you two, they&apos;re going to have our heads before you can decide who has the longer stick. Can we get on with this?&quot;
&quot;Right,&quot; Vince says.
&quot;Come inside. We have a feast and table ready, so long as you don&apos;t mind a little dust.&quot;
Valentina whispers, &quot;The first time the Merlot have ever set foot in a Carmine outpost.&quot;
Romin&apos;s grin spans from ear to ear. &quot;I still can&apos;t believe you managed to pull this off,&quot; he tells her. &quot;You&apos;re amazing. I&apos;m so proud of you!&quot; He embraces her until she grasps for breath.
&quot;Careful. You&apos;re gonna knock me out with strength like that,&quot; she says.
The Merlot are escorted down the stairs, and while the leadership convene in the depths of the outpost, the Merlot and Carmine associates begin to talk. The young members, inculcated in the lowest ranks as new blood, recognize each other from the Academy and begin to socialize, ignorant to the bad blood, just elated to see kind, familiar faces, and even manage to introduce the older members.
We follow Romin. The vault door is open, and across an open space once littered with liquor bottles and kegs, the floor is stocked with munitions, boxes, and tables of trained Carmine communicating on the talking wires to other provinces.
&quot;Don&apos;t look surprised,&quot; Romin tells me. They&apos;re all like me, buddy. They party as hard as they work.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m just impressed, &quot; I say.
The grand steel doors close behind the figureheads of each faction, with both Romin and Valentina accompanying them, and so Sylvia, the Vermillion children and I are left on the other side.
It&apos;s not long before the children of the Carmine bring their boxes of toys over to socialize. A handsome Carmine boy approaches Vera. Virgil plays &apos;war&apos; with some of the commanders&apos; sons: mixed not by faction, but by choice, and Vanna&apos;s led off to paint with the toddlers by one of the Seminary Sisters.
Sylvia and I leave as the only impartial guests &mdash; but as soon as I smell liquor, I know they&apos;re on track for fine camaraderie.
 &quot;I feel so warm right now,&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;I do, too. But we can&apos;t get too comfortable,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;But that doesn&apos;t mean we can&apos;t enjoy it,&quot; she says, as takes my hand, tensioning her fingers between the spaces of mine. &quot;I want to savor this. And I want to savor us.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;ll cherish every second,&quot; I promise her, and I notice a naive excitement kindled within me when I walk home, as added heat against the cold. I don&apos;t allow myself think the words or else I might jinx it, that <em>this all could actually work</em>, and maybe this feeling is just a balancing act between two emotions at war: anxiety over the outcome, and excitement over these recent victories. The thought is a branch I know will never hold the weight of this world, but I still reach for it, enough that I joke to Sylvia:
&quot;With all these impossible things, maybe even Clint will be home.&quot;
&quot;Whoa there,&quot; she says. &quot;Don&apos;t ask for too much.&quot;
But sure enough, the sight astonishes us when we turn the corner, frightening me enough that I draw my knife and slip to the side of the house as Sylvia follows closely behind.
&quot;I locked up before we left with Val, didn&apos;t I?&quot; I whisper. &quot;We never left the lights on. We just slept by the fire.&quot;
&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;Well, there&apos;s nothing valuable in there at least. I sold it all.&quot; We sneak along the perimeter, but I left all the curtains drawn to keep things safe.
There&apos;s a clattering.
&quot;You hear that, right?&quot;
&quot;Like steel on steel. Or nails on a chalkboard.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, and&mdash;&quot;
We hear a laugh, and my stomach drops. I press my ear to the window as Sylvia does the same. It&apos;s at least a man and a woman in there, yet they&apos;re not bustling around &mdash; gathering things and checking boxes, scrounging for jewelry or something.
I catch the whiff of some nostalgic smell, and for a moment I&apos;m lost before I come to my senses. The low bass reminds me of Clint&apos;s voice I could hear through the floorboards when he came home from work, his heavy footfalls, and the small, clattering footsteps of my mother.
&quot;It might actually be him,&quot; I tell Sylvia. &quot;Gods above, I swear, if the bastard&apos;a showing off the house <em>I</em> pay for to some woman...&quot;
I peer between the drapes and only catch a sliver of the foyer: Clint&apos;s jacket hung over the couch, and a small, crimson cloak.
&quot;Dear Khiras, he works fast,&quot; I say.
&quot;What are you on about?&quot;
&quot;The lady&apos;s in the First Red, I think,&quot; but then I notice a familiar piece of jewelry that fell from the pocket onto the floor.
&quot;No way. No. No, no, no, Clint, what are you thinking? The old lady? Or...&quot;
I&apos;m at the front door before Sylvia can stop me. Maybe I can still save her from him: he&apos;s been the furthest thing from a role model on relationships ever since he became a widow.
I creak open the front door slowly, wishing I&apos;d lubricated the hinges and kept this house a fraction as good as it used to be. The female voice is clearer now, and it&apos;s deeper&mdash; not as nasally as Maude&apos;s.
I find my mother&apos;s necklace on the floor, and the smell of lavender hits me as I return it to its place around my neck. I feel an unfamiliar energy inside it. I look around and it&apos;s as if the house is just slightly cleaner; dusted in all the places the maids forget to clean; the smell of dinner so savory I almost forget why I&apos;m here.
I&apos;m almost afraid to enter. It feels like when I was a child in trouble, when I&apos;d sneak down the stairs to listen as Mom and Dad talked aloud about my misdeeds and how to punish them. But I still feel myself drawn to the dining room, knife in hand, unable to stop as I prepare to slice at whatever illusion threatens my sense of reality.
The knife clatters to the floor when I see them sitting on the same side of the table, teary-eyed, reminiscing on the forgotten years that separated them for so long. I say her name aloud and the illusion crumbles. That magnificent dream came true after all this time.

&quot;You finally . . . came home,&quot; I say, and she rises from her chair at the words, quick to approach and comfort me, just as I know she did before to her widowed lover.
&quot;I&apos;ll never be able to apologize enough for what I had to do. I was made. I was called back to serve the First Red as its messenger.&quot;
I should be elated like Romin was in finding his estranged father, but I find my feelings of hope and peace curdle to bitterness.
My mother senses my reluctance. &quot;I don&apos;t expect you to forgive me for how I left you, but I had to.&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s not that,&quot; I tell her, and when I look at the empty place-setting across the table with the pillow on the seat, I can feel that relentless anxiety hunt me down. Clint&apos;s the only one out of all of us that has no idea what&apos;s coming. Moira&apos;s the only one that can fully empathize as a member of the Carmine, unless Sylvia truly remembers what happened to us in those past lives.
&quot;I can feel that impermanence, too. But it&apos;s better to have happened in the first place than to never have happened at all. I just wish that . . .&quot; Her words dampen when her eyes fall to the empty place setting. &quot;I wish the beautiful daughter of ours didn&apos;t have to suffer.&quot;
&quot;And we&apos;re going to make them pay,&quot; I insist.
&quot;But at what cost?&quot; Sylvia asks.
&quot;At the cost of whatever it takes. Or else we&apos;ll never be free,&quot; I say.
&quot;What, you think this is some kind of conspiracy nonsense?&quot; Clint asks. &quot;I loathe the golden cunts of the Afterlife&mdash;&quot; He looks to Moira. &quot;Sorry. As much as the next guy, but this?&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s happening, and it&apos;s very real,&quot; I tell him. &quot;The Afterlife took Ellie, because she has Divine Blood inside her, and is capable of becoming the Mask of the Humans and Chymaera.&quot;
&quot;What are you talking about? I don&apos;t have divine blood,&quot; Clint says. &quot;And Moira isn&apos;t anything special.&quot; She glares at him again. &quot;Genetically. I mean, love, you&apos;re special in other ways.&quot;
&quot;That&apos;s because I&apos;m a Chymaeran,&quot; she says.
&quot;Chymaerans don&apos;t exist in Blackwater. Maybe not even anywhere,&quot; Clint argues.
&quot;Then watch.&quot;
Moira lifts the ring of guise tokens from her pocket, withdrawing a weathered one. I notice the pendant of my necklace is now around her ring. In an instant, her flesh grows obsidian and her mass coalesces into a shorter figure, taking on the guise of the older woman that helped in Clint&apos;s shop.
&quot;There was a reason I was drawn to work there. Memories fade from guise to guise, and when you lose a marker, everything fades away to your conscious mind. But instinct is the proof that they still persist somewhere.&quot; She takes the token of my necklace between her fingers and changes back in mere seconds to the face I recognize, looking as if she hasn&apos;t aged a day.
&quot;Then why didn&apos;t you say anything to me?&quot;
&quot;I was afraid to break the perfect life we had. If anyone knew that I was a Chymaeran, or a messenger of the First Red, it would risk everything. We were never meant to hold a guise for longer than months. And to hold it for so many years...&quot;
&quot;So Chymaerans&apos; guises don&apos;t age, then,&quot; I say.
&quot;We can only hold a snapshot,&quot; she says. 
And when I realize it, the bile rises in my stomach and the meal before me becomes unpalatable. I&apos;m afraid to ask.
&quot;When did it happen, then,&quot; Clint says.
&quot;Clint. Don&apos;t ruin this,&quot; Moira says.
&quot;You-you look exactly like the picture we took after Ellie was born, and I&apos;ve looked at that picture every day, committed it to memory more than the back of my hand,&quot; Clint says.
&quot;Please,&quot; she pleads.
&quot;So when, then? When did it happen?&quot; She almost becomes a stranger to him when he grabs her shirt, yet he can&apos;t quite get there. &quot;Was it before or after? You said you were infertile after we met, after we fell in love, yet...&quot;
&quot;She was,&quot; Moira says.
Clint says, &quot;Then when&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Did you kill her?&quot; I finish. The genetic fury floods in our veins, and only Sylvia can hold me back. The memory of recent events returns as the surprise fades. &quot;I saw her, dead, in Everett&apos;s basement. I saw her skeleton. My foot crunched her dry ribs!&quot;
&quot;It wasn&apos;t like that, I promise. I did nothing!&quot;
So why, then? Why did my real mother die?&quot; The word <em>real</em> injures her, hitting so hard it glances off of Clint. &quot;I saw Everett&apos;s basement, all those horrific instruments, memories of a time he tried to make me forget, so why? Why did he do that to me, and why did you allow it?&quot;
&quot;It was all to save Blackwater. All of this.&quot;
&quot;What did he do to you, son?&quot; asks Clint.
She says, &quot;It was because you were the only source of divinity he could use.&quot;
&quot;Titus, what did he do?&quot;
&quot;<em>Use?</em>&quot; I ask. &quot;My mother loved me for who I was. She was the only one who ever truly loved me! Never a Chymaeran who killed her to take her identity. I was gods-damn right to believe love could never be unconditional.&quot;
&quot;But I didn&apos;t kill her. It was Everett,&quot; she finally admits, &quot;and he went through with it before I could even decide. The self-hatred and regret consumed that man faster than the Chymaeran Curse ever could. You know why he got it? Because I gave it to him. He showed me what he had done. He told me to continue, to finish the job. So I punished him. And to pick up the consequence of his selfishness, I decided to take her identity.&quot; She doesn&apos;t cry, but she bends her neck to glance down just past my feet. &quot;So many identities, Titus. I buried myself with so many other faces to try to forget all those years since I disappeared, thinking myself unworthy, and the guilt pains me to this day.&quot;
I don&apos;t respond. I don&apos;t tear up, either. I feel myself retreat to that same numb headspace my circumstances created for me, all those years when she was absent, when I thanklessly picked up all the slack of Clint&apos;s failures.
&quot;But I felt all the feelings she did. I was just foolish to think I could be anything close to what she was. I was Moira for so many years that I internalized every piece of her, and I could feel it. I felt her take over. I felt her understanding. And I actually became her. I am her,&quot; she says, &quot;I am every part a continuation of her, and I love you just as unconditionally as she ever did.&quot;
&quot;Then why weren&apos;t you there,&quot; I say.
&quot;Because the Pureblood Chymaerans would have caught me. And I was, Titus! I took the faces of everyone around you, of all the ones you least expected. Every chance I had, on every mission.&quot;
&quot;Then what do you remember?&quot;
&quot;I remember watching you care for your sister every night that you could. Walking her to school. How hard you studied in academics and fought on the training field, and I watched as long as I could, until the list of guises since dragged on more and more, and my memory was fragmented with so many voices of the dead, unable to do anything, locked out of a relationship with the people I love...&quot; She trails off.
&quot;Ellie.&quot; Clint&apos;s voice wavers. &quot;Is she even&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Yes. Absolutely, yes,&quot; Moira says. &quot;She&apos;s every ounce of you as much as she is me. She&apos;s truly your daughter.&quot;
&quot;Then what about my blood?&quot; I ask.
&quot;Exactly,&quot; Clint says. &quot;What did Everett do to him?&quot;
&quot;Distilled for the Pure Essence. Everett knew you were Fletcher. He found you out there. He said it was as if you could sense him coming from beyond time, waiting in the Reservoir. When he returned to that site you appeared to him. Resurrected, expending your right to the Masks of Life and Death with the power of the divine, so you could come back and resist the laws of nature. You lost it in that sacrifice. So someone else had to carry the power of both sides.&quot;
&quot;Both sides,&quot; I repeat. &quot;Then that means...&quot;
&quot;You&apos;re half Chymaeran. Just like Ellie,&quot; she says. &quot;You have the true Royal blood on both sides. The Human royalty of Ullrich mixed with the Chymaeran royalty of Eaudicroux, the escaped princess known to the Humans as Evella.&quot;
My body feels foreign to me when I look at my hands. The room spins as I gasp for breath, and I sit at the table.
&quot;And Everett infused me with that pure Essence containing  the divinity of both sides, day after day, telling me that next guise was just another accidental casualty, until I realized that day that she was still alive, that grief-stricken Everett never planned for an accident.&quot;
I remember the records Lyra and I found in the basement: the names scrawled on them in a single letter.
&quot;So what, then? Where does that leave us?&quot; I ask, and it&apos;s all I can manage, staring at the uneaten meal before us.
&quot;We still have a mission. It&apos;s what it&apos;s been this whole time, for all of us,&quot; Moira says. &quot;We have to save Blackwater. Your actions beyond the walls bought us this last chance. And all we have to do now is to see it through.&quot;
Clint slumps in the chair on the other side of the table. Sylvia sits there in silence, still too afraid to enter our feud.
&quot;Just know that I love you, and I&apos;m so infinitely proud of the man you&apos;ve become. Caring for Ellie and Clint since I left. Courting this beautiful woman as your girlfriend,&quot; she says, motioning to Sylvia who blushes.
&quot;I always imagined telling you how hard it was, what you would say to me, how you might comfort me. That&apos;s what gave me the strength, imagining you&apos;d return,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;Let&apos;s enjoy this meal before it goes from lukewarm to cold,&quot; Moira says. Our eyes all drag to the empty place setting in the absence of words, feeling as if it absorbs all the color in the room: waiting, and maybe hoping, the small girl might lift herself from some hiding place under the table and join us for our last meal."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Reunion/Separation","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Eight","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Forty-Nine","ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":8,"ChapterFull":49,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":157,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"152","Synopsis":"Titus wishes his story could have ended here, but there is still so much more that needs to be done.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"5.49","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

I hear Clint&apos;s voice drop when Sylvia and I head outside. I know he now unloads the weight of all that suffering he held for years with the only one he can ever do it with. She&apos;s no longer trapped behind glass in a memory, forcing him to remember the sound of her voice like an endless game of telephone. She&apos;s in there now, and still listening, however long it takes to ease years of her widowed husband&apos;s pain.
It terrifies me that they both agreed to join the fight. The cold is the only thing that can satiate the pit in my stomach, but it tells me I&apos;m attached to that promise that this is the last chance. I pray the lights might just stay dark forever; that my father&apos;s relieving happiness never ends; that the sensation of Sylvia&apos;s hand warming mine might last forever, but Ellie&apos;s promise still haunts me.
My stomach curdles on little substance, enough that the acid rises, burning with each level it climbs. Our hands grasp the chipped railing worn by decades of relentless storms. We watch together as Darktime floods the streets like Endogeny, and despite her height, it looks like she struggles to reach the next string of words. I clasp my gloved hand in hers, but not because she needs comfort. It&apos;s for me. I&apos;ll get lost in these feelings of anxiety if she doesn&apos;t tether me to this moment.
&quot;It&apos;s wonderful that you got the chance to see her again. I&apos;m happy for you,&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;It was a blessing from the Gods, no matter how late it was,&quot; I tell her.
She loses her sight in the middle distance somewhere, retreating backwards on some persisting memory until I call her back.
I ask &quot;What is it? Are you anxious for when the Carmine and Merlot call us?&quot;
&quot;A little. But it&apos;s not that,&quot; Sylvia says.
&quot;Then what is it?&quot;
&quot;I saw her there.&quot;
&quot;Who?&quot; I ask
&quot;I saw my mother.&quot;
I turn to her, excited, expecting to find the same joy I felt when Moira came back to us. I&apos;m surprised when all I see is confusion.
&quot;It was just a memory. The only glimpses so got were just flashes of the past before we met.&quot;
&quot;Then how did you know it was her?&quot;
&quot;Because I could tell it was all a memory. It was only a flash, but I&apos;m certain it was decades. Maybe centuries, even. I&apos;m sure the other side of me has been around forever, but I couldn&apos;t see anything more. Like looking into the streetlights as snow falls in your eyes&mdash;&quot; Sylvia says, as she points to the amber smudges of lighttime glowing through the flakes, &quot;I was too afraid to see, and I blinked before so could remember. I experienced a feeling I never want to remember.&quot;
&quot;The feeling of what?&quot;
&quot;Eternity,&quot;she says. &quot;I remembered ages in that time. Other lives, when I escaped the same way I did now, spans of hundreds of years where I witnessed nearly everything, so bored I returned to collect dust on the shelves of divinity for another infinity until boredom became tedious. And I know that I did that. Over and over, and now I see that long, dark phantom trails behind me of everything I&apos;ve ever experienced, telling me I&apos;ve done this all before. I mean&mdash; could you imagine living the same life over and over, forever?&quot; She falters on the delivery of the last words once she realizes who she&apos;s talking to.
&quot;I have an idea,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;I was never designed to experience this world, because I was made for something different. Do you know why the world is indifferent? Because it&apos;s driven by forces of nature that lived long enough to become entirely passive.&quot;
&quot;And you&apos;re afraid to feel that way again.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m just certain it will always come to me. Only through forgetting can I ever experience life through fresh eyes, but I could see it, Titus, it was so terrifying, that emptiness, not even black or white, but clear and colorless...&quot;
She buries herself into my shoulder.
I say, &quot;I might never understand fully, but I know we&apos;ve both experienced it on a mortal level. It was so stupid, but&mdash; ever since the orphanage, my room was dark and cold because sometimes I thought if I left my windows open, I&apos;d freeze and die peacefully in my sleep. And I prayed for it.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m glad you didn&apos;t. Or I&apos;d tear you away from the reservoir to bring you back into my arms,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;d warm you so you&apos;d never feel that cold emptiness again. Because I felt it. And I know it&apos;s waiting there.&quot;
&quot;What is the meaning of life to a person who lives for others, in those idle moments when they&apos;re not needed?&quot;
&quot;I mean, they sit on a shelf. Just like I know I did for years in the Reservoir,&quot; she says.
&quot;Sometimes it feels like mortal life is waiting to die with the life you never asked for, finding ways to pass the time between the moments of meaning.&quot; I exhale between my hands to warm my frosted fingers, then cup them around hers. &quot;I don&apos;t know. So is immortal life ever different from mortal life? Or are they just fractals of the same experience?&quot; I watch as snowflakes fall on our gloves, tessellated with a hundred microscopic prongs of ice, each different from the other. But as soon as we look, the heat dissolves them: their pattern forever lost.
&quot;Please. If you feel even a fraction of the same way, then what is it? What keeps you going?&quot;
I laugh. &quot;I mean, I don&apos;t have a choice, right? Time and entropy do that for me, I sure don&apos;t have to push them along.&quot;
&quot;But why? Even if you&apos;ve seen anything. I mean, maybe I came here because I thought I could learn. Or maybe I came here to forget all over again. I don&apos;t know, but...&quot;
I surprise her when I grab her by the shoulders, pushing her against the wall. She&apos;s caught so off-guard that she kicks the heel of her boot back, splintering in the same place my head dented when Lyra dropped me against the glass, and still, I&apos;m too afraid to see if it shatters the same way.
Her face flushes when I pin her there. Before she can speak another word, she sinks down the wall until I&apos;m able to meet her at her level. My lips press against hers as the snowflakes dissolve against her skin, steadily heating our bodies together, refusing to give to the enveloping sea of early-morning darkness.
It doesn&apos;t matter whether this is once or a hundred-thousand times. I think of how many cycles it took to get past the death of Valentina and Romin, thinking I had to say goodbye to them forever. I remember the endless cycle of waking and sleeping in that chamber beyond time, but yet something always persisted there. I was found by Ellie when I even lost myself, and every reset, it was memory that brought me here.
&quot;I&apos;d like to think the small moments of meaning are worth weathering that stillness. This is what fills eternity for Gods and mortals. Because it persists as long as memory lives.&quot;
I embrace her until her trembling stops.
She says, &quot;I&apos;m just so scared, Titus.&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; I reassure her. &quot;We both stand at the edge of everything with no idea what comes next.&quot;
&quot;But what if you die and I live another forever?&quot; She asks.
&quot;Then I&apos;ll love you as long as my forever holds. Enough to let you live until your eternity ends and we meet again.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;ll be so alone,&quot; she says.
&quot;I know,&quot; I find it&apos;s so hard to practice what I preach when the anxiety still eats at me. I can say the lesson, but I can&apos;t feel it. I don&apos;t even know if these hypocritical emotions will let me live it. 
I cling to this last moment of her warmth like a dying bonfire in the frozen woods, uncertain whether we&apos;ll all freeze, or worse&mdash; which ones will make it back alive. 
I wish I never had to let go, and I hate the recurring thought that tells me I still could."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":105,"ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":8,"ChapterFull":49,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":105,"Index":159,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"154","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Vince and Raine describe the plan at the Compound.

The call came a quarter hour later in the form of a Merlotan touring car driven by Carmine brothers. We were clinging to each other the whole time, waiting until the other felt full. Yet we knew we topped each other off as soon as we came together.
I leave Clint there inside the house with my mother: a fitting, unspoken goodbye. I can&apos;t enter those doors again or else I might never leave, so I&apos;m the one that takes Sylvia&apos;s hand, leading her towards uncertainty as the Carmine open the doors somewhere past the snowflakes.
I make the mistake of looking back when the flurries dissolve the house to a single glow. No light might ever grace the house again when Endogeny eviscerates the streets, and I can only pray to the Gods they&apos;ll all live to see my dream. Yet I&apos;m still convinced the only Goddess that can answer is the one cuddled to my left arm, shivering in mortal flesh as I share my coat with her.
The compound is vacant when we arrive. The early morning air is dark and silent, devoid of the bustle of pleasure or business, and it sets me at unease as we descend into the depths. Valentina and Romin reflect our expressions with the same somber faces. We&apos;ve all gained so much to mourn&mdash; and here we are when the bill comes due.
Vincent&apos;s voice thunders across the room of figureheads. Transcribers in the hall tap over talking wires to relay the words in dots and dashes to every Carmine stronghold that listens.
&quot;The Vermillion Merlot were meant to die tonight. Thus bounds the timeline of our plan,&quot; he says. &quot;We will not hesitate from sending someone in our place. The Carmine already have moles hat will do whatever it takes to stabilize this plan from above.&quot;
Raine takes the reins when Vince steps back. &quot;Our highest mission is to extinguish the Afterlife before that Chymaeran weapon Endogeny can kill us off. Their greatest weakness is at our highest numbers. They subsist on ignorance, which is the reason they can&apos;t survive when all of us strike together. And so I speak to all of you Carmine out there in every province, ready to give your lives as the truest blood of the Humans, to know that your sacrifice will reflect on eternity, planting the seeds through death that your future lives will bask in the shade of.&quot;
Vince channels his unlikely comrade&apos;s excitement. &quot;We are the only province of Merlot aware of the ruse that awaits us. But we can use this to our advantage&mdash; it&apos;s easier to blend in with the ignorant. We will send a small team of Merlot on the lift that was meant to explode, as emissaries of the Vermillion. This team will slip through the Afterlife to open the gates and destabilize the walls in any way they can.&quot;
Raine says, &quot;The Carmine teams will rush the foothills of the Afterlife from every angle with every piece of equipment available. We will strike fast and hard before Endogeny can claim enough flesh to overturn the fight.&quot;
He turns to the son standing beside him with a glimmer of hope and pride. Romin straightens.
&quot;My son Romin will be leading Province Fourteen&apos;s charge. Romin?&quot;
&quot;The front lines of every district will convene on the Merlotan foothills, breaking the middle walls separating the Afterlife from the lower lands. Each has received a message from our district&apos;s Merlot, telling them to check beneath their lifts. Only the Gods can tell if they will listen.&quot;
&quot;Thanks, Brother Romin,&quot; Raine says, resting his hand on his son&apos;s shoulder. &quot;We hope the front lines will meet little resistance, but the Afterlife will surely sense such a surge of Carmine and Merlot at their gates.&quot;
Vince says, &quot;That&apos;s where the Carmine and Merlot demolition teams coalesce. Sorry&mdash; where they come together. With our combined dead Essence, we&apos;ll blast the walls at these key strategic points,&quot; he says, pointing at a crimson-ink Merlotan map marked with X&apos;es. &quot;We&apos;ll blast their walls with the very thing they try to harvest from us, and once we breach their walls, the remaining soldiers will have free game on the Afterlife and all its blissfully unconscious purveyors of absolute ignorance.&quot;
 &quot;Blind bastards, he means,&quot; Raine says.
&quot;Yeah, that&apos;s right.&quot;
Raine says, &quot;Your leaders will spread this message to all the Carmine that this hour calls their allegiance. They will spread it further to each province&apos;s Academy, to the City Guard, and to all the civilians that will listen, to make sure they know what awaits them, to seek the courageous ones that wish to thrive on the right side of Human history and rise to this occasion. They will know we strike in this hour that will define the persistence of true humanity for now and forevermore!&quot;
&quot;And we will do this together,&quot; Vincent says. &quot;Without division, we are unstoppable.&quot;
The raucous applause echoes across every stronghold. Carmine and Merlot in ours shed their difference of colors to congregate together, having learned that all along they shared the same contemptible adversary, unified by the same unlikely purpose. My voice strains on a mix of excitement and panic as our fireteam shouts with everything we have&mdash; because to me, at least, every second of silence is cold as death.
I feel Vince grasp my shoulder, and when I turn to face him, I find Raine standing next to him.
&quot;You guys are fast friends,&quot; I say.
&quot;Only for the cause,&quot; Raine assures me. &quot;I don&apos;t hate him.&quot;
&quot;That&apos;s great,&quot; Vince says. &quot;Let&apos;s stay focused here. You&apos;re slated to join the Merlot team being sent to the Afterlife.&quot;
&quot;With whom?&quot; I ask.
&quot;With my daughters. You will be a servant with Lyra. I&apos;d have you wear that tacky outfit you wore yesterday, but it got a little too tattered, so I&apos;ve got something else for you.&quot; He hands me another set of clothes. &quot;This was made by one of our finest seamstresses before she died, to eventually be tailored to my son Virgil once he stopped growing. But this world won&apos;t hold long enough for that tradition to stay relevant.&quot;
&quot;I promise I&apos;ll wear it with honor,&quot; I say.
&quot;You and Lyra know the most about the Afterlife out of anyone in our province. And Lyra has the experience with Essence.&quot;
&quot;But she&apos;s the daughter of Ullrich. You know that, right? What if he sees her?&quot;
&quot;This isn&apos;t a military matter. Our father is far too busy right now to be dealing with the Merlot,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;I can&apos;t miss a chance to strike at him when I&apos;ve missed every other opportunity. I need to pay off the chance you gave me to live,&quot; she says.
Vera and Valentina stand beside their father.  Vera says, &quot;You&apos;ll be escorting us to the grand celebration. And though we have no idea what it holds, we&apos;ll take whatever chance we can to give our friends at the walls the help they need.&quot; Vera places the hat atop her sister&apos;s head, and Valentina adjusts it.
&quot;But what about Sylvia?&quot;
Vince says, &quot;There are only so many we can take on the lift within reason. I&apos;m sorry, Titus.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;ll be with Romin,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;We&apos;ll meet you once you break us through to the other side.&quot;
It takes a couple breaths before I grab the clothes in front of me. <em>I</em>&apos;<em>m still on the best path. This is the best I can do</em>. I reach for Virgil&apos;s untailored outfit as the Merlotan seamstresses take dimensions, ready to shape me from tattered Snowdrifter into polished royalty. The stylists clip and comb my tangled mess of hair and trim my beard. When I look in the mirror, I&apos;m twice as refined as that lonely valedictorian that gave the Academy&apos;s last speech. 
The Merlotan motorcar awaits to take me to my destiny. I feel like someone else, someone better, but Id like to think it isn&apos;t from the new appearance.
Sylvia and I kiss before I take a seat next to Valentina.
&quot;I&apos;ll see you again,&quot; she tells me.
&quot;Wherher it&apos;s tomorrow or the other side of infinity, I will wait there.&quot;
&quot;I love you so much,&quot; she tells me.
&quot;I know. And I love you, too.&quot;"},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Liftoff","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Nine","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Fifty","ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":9,"ChapterFull":50,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":160,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"155","Synopsis":"The Carmine-Merlot master plan is set in motion.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"5.50","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

The vacant Merlot estate unsettled us when we arrived: so strange without groundskeepers painstakingly tending every leaf of the hedges. We walked through the outdoor maze of shrubs and gardens before we finally arrived at the lift.
Now Vera flips the handle. The power jostles the rack-and-pinion drive to motion, and so the car inches sixty degrees upwards at ever-so-small a climb. The four of us stand at the edge of the railing. It feels so surreal when my eyes fall to that same place where we emerged from the drainage tunnel, as if in new clothes and finer appearance I look down upon my older self, and I wonder whether I&apos;ve grown enough.
&quot;Where did it happen?&quot;
The question surprises me. Valentina approaches the railing without her hat, allowing her ears to twitch with the chilled crosswinds, and it reminds me of a moment in a past life.
&quot;At least you believed me this time,&quot; I say.
&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;Nothing.&quot; I can&apos;t force my eyes to leave that spot. Somehow I still believe the woman standing beside me is buried there, the bloodied mess of her body crushed beneath the rubble of the ten-ton machine actively chugging along the rails.
&quot;There. Is that where it happened?&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say, afraid to overshadow.
&quot;So they stranded me here,&quot; she says. &quot;In that other life.&quot;
&quot;They did.&quot;
&quot;I can&apos;t believe it,&quot; Vera says. &quot;So Mother&apos;s hatred beat Victor&apos;s love in the end, even to the grav. I just can&apos;t believe I let it happen.&quot;
&quot;But you tried. In one future, you abandoned your family to look for Valentina. You never ended up on the lift, and so your fireteam joined you,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;I just wish I did more. I let my sister suffer for years, and all that time, I didn&apos;t want to know the truth.&quot;
Lyra approaches the railing. &quot;I let that same kind of regret consume me for years, and I can tell you it never added to anything.&quot; She touches me with her shoulder as she speaks. &quot;And all I&apos;ve learned is that the future is all we have to act on.&quot;
Valentina embraces her older sister. &quot;All this time you&apos;ve given me someone to look up to. You were in the higher class, after all. I envied you. Fame in moving pictures gave me nothing of what I felt I was missing.&quot;
&quot;But you were the stronger one. My silence always reminded me how weak I was, compared to how you took your pain and shaped it into something.&quot;
&quot;I forgive you,&quot; Valentina says.
&quot;And so the car of estranged siblings reaches new heights,&quot; Lyra says.
There are two stops before we make our final ascent, and each time we come to a jarring stop, Vera has to press the glowing button on the wall to keep us going. It takes an hour before the train car nears the summit, climbing higher and higher until we think it&apos;ll run out of mountain, but then it rises through the clouds. 
I can hardly catch a view of the tracks ahead when I crane my neck from the railing. Merlotan creations like these are only meant for looking down. Right now, the provincial leaders should be leading their districts into battle, breaking the line of the foothills so the demolition teams can sweep in from behind, depending on us for whatever we can manage.
&quot;What should we expect?&quot; I ask Valentina.
&quot;I&apos;ve never been up here.&quot; She nudges her sister. &quot;Vera?&quot;
&quot;The districts feed in sets of threes to a common station. Then five separate train lines lead from these stations to the heart of the Afterlife.&quot;
&quot;So we&apos;ll be meeting someone else?&quot;
&quot;It depends on whether they got the message,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;And whether they believed it, most of all.&quot;
We hear the great steel door power up when we approach. Steam hisses when the latches release, and as the ten-ton car decelerates, we prepare ourselves for the sudden lurch when it crashes against the station.
All that&apos;s left is for the door to open, and it inches slowly on several huffs of steam. We peer beneath once the gap is taller than Valentina, only to find a grand entryway adorned with gold and marble.
Vera speaks in a whisper. &quot;This is the unifying chamber for the last three provinces.&quot;The numbers THIRTEEN, FOURTEEN, and FIFTEEN are etched into each entrance. The other two lifts are open at this highest point, dark and empty, and I can only assume their travelers are ahead of us.
&quot;Oh. Vermillion party?&quot; A surprised voice says. &quot;You&apos;re late. The celebration will be starting soon, we need to get you over there!&quot; He gestures to the trolley terminal, implying it&apos;s already on the other end of the tracks.
&quot;Father&apos;s still arguing with the Carmine over some petty compromise, Gods above,&quot;Vera says. &quot;He sent for us so <em>some</em> Merlot blood would be here to sip your wine and gossip.&quot;
&quot;We&apos;ll fetch a ride. Come this way,&quot; the Attendant says. Our footsteps clatter against the reflective floors, echoing across the vacant chamber. A chauffeur is already parked at the front of the complex, inside a vehicle so bright and metallic it looks like it&apos;s made of light.
The countryside is even more verdant as I remember, reminding me of Everett&apos;s storybooks of imaginary lands when I was a child. Cascading vines adorn the marble structures where denizens gather in pearlescent clothes, and we whiz past on paved roads, catching only brief glimpses between the foliage.
&quot;By Gods, how much their Essence must have grown for it to be this full of life,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;The climate is so warm.&quot;
&quot;So you&apos;ve been up here before?&quot; Vera asks. &quot;My sister and I have only been up here once, and it&apos;s when we were very young.&quot;
&quot;I lived up here, for years. Held against my will, I guess,&quot; says Lyra.
Vera says, &quot;It&apos;s all so disgusting coming from down below. But why would you leave? If you knew nothing of the lower lands, I think I&apos;d live here forever.&quot;
&quot;Because of what happened after my family fell apart. My father was all I had. One day, I woke up and realized I was old enough to decide my future for myself. He stopped loving me, so focused on his obsession of the past, turning into something I couldn&apos;t recognize. I knew had a debt to pay for the chance at life I was given. And I knew for damn sure I wasn&apos;t going to waste it up there.&quot;
&quot;Just keep the mission first,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;Trust me. I want nothing more than to get my revenge&mdash; except for making sure he sees how it all ends.&quot;
Before I realize how time has passed us, we&apos;re parked in front of the grand hall. The trolleys are all parked outside, looking so small compared to the massive train cars carrying loads between the lower and upper lands.
The driver opens the doors. &quot;You need to get inside,&quot; he says. &quot;The celebration has already begun, and you&apos;re going to miss the most important part.&quot;"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":107,"ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":9,"ChapterFull":50,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":107,"Index":162,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"157","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Ullrich gives a speech to raise a toast.

The doors open to the expansive, three-story atrium, yet it doesn&apos;t even feel like we&apos;re going inside. Plants cascade from the three-story ceiling above, only separated from the sky by planes of glass, and in the far distance, the orchestra plays to a space so grand it catches no echo off the walls.
But my focus is far from captivation. &quot;Remember why we&apos;re here. This isn&apos;t about their celebration. We need to get out and help them breach the wall,&quot; I say.
&quot;Out on the streets, you mean?&quot; Lyra says. &quot;They&apos;ll detain you the minute they find you&apos;re a shitblood. You wear the uniform of a servant.&quot;
&quot;And it&apos;s not just you. Not even the Merlot are accepted. We&apos;re all just a resource to them,&quot; Vera says, and when the denizens of the Afterlife refuse our eye contact, I believe her.
We&apos;re herded into the event hall. The chaperones follow so closely behind that I feel claustrophobic despite such a massive space. The choir chants like shouts of the damned in the Reservoir, and the constant thrum of strings on a single note make the room feel like another chamber beyond time.
The Merlot will adorn their houses with anything that shows their wealth and prestige, but I find the Afterlife are on an entirely different level. There isn&apos;t even the furniture to display such worthless items, leaving only the dining tables and chairs, adorned with the name tags of each family that sit in their place. It surprises us when, for such a meticulously planned event, the name tag on our table is blank. The servers look on in confusion. And when we scan the room for all the faces turned to hear the haunting music, we find three other nameless vacancies without a soul in their seats.
The last note dies abruptly without walls to echo, and the Merlot fill the uncomfortable void with applause, until even their clapping grows stale. A server comes by to pour a dark glass of wine for each of us into a brazen goblet before we can protest or ask for water, parched from our long climb.
As chatter between families fills the vacancy of programming, we expect the titans of Merlotan industry to take the stage in celebration&mdash; meaning that long, dull speech might be our ticket to escape. I take a sip of the wine: so acidic that it burns my throat, but to my left, Vera guzzles it.
&quot;Gods above,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;We&apos;re not here to get drunk!&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m parched, Val. Besides. Real Merlotan wine is grape juice compared to this.&quot;
Valentina takes a cautious sip, abruptly halted with a short cough. Before she can sip again, the lights dim so that only the natural sunlight filters through the distant windows.
&quot;I&apos;m surprised by how many guards are here, just for a celebratory event,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;This has got to be at least a quarter of the Royal Guard.&quot; Peeking through the glass, we see swarms of them gathered outside. We thought they they at the doors to keep others from coming in, but...
&quot;Thank you all for gathering here this evening, ladies and gentlemen of the Merlot. Tonight, we celebrate you for all your contributions to the future of Blackwater, because you are the reason we have a chance to realize humanity&apos;s next golden age.&quot;
My eyes fall to Lyra before I realize the voice. She ducks beneath the table, bumping her head on the smooth mahogany, jolting all the glasses on the table, and I reach to catch her chalice before it can tilt over the edge, spilling a couple drops before I hold it in place.
&quot;Are you alright, Vermillion table? Such a surprise you&apos;re here to join us,&quot; Ullrich says.
&quot;Damn it, Lyra,&quot; I whisper.
Ullrich continues. &quot;The reason Blackwater thrived was because the Merlot were such a fine conduit between the Essenced and the weak. So I want to hold a toast to the people of Blackwater whom you&apos;ve allowed to so fruitfully grow.&quot;
He raises the chalice as the guards&apos; piercing eyes watch every Merlotan family. We all take another drink. I can hardly stomach a sip before the liquor burns my lips, so sweet yet so dry.
&quot;Maybe I need to let the liquor settle before I get too choked up on a story,&quot; Ullrich says, and the audience laughs. &quot;Many of you might not know me. I don&apos;t deal in the affairs of business, trade, and production as much as you do, but I deal with the affairs of the military and the Academy. My name is Ullrich Valensend, and I am the Grandmaster General of Blackwater.&quot;
&quot;Lyra, are you going to get out of there?&quot; I whisper. My hands reach for the strands of her hair still tethered to the table, only to find an indentation in the table&apos;s surface from the spill.
&quot;We&apos;re dead if he sees me.&quot;
&quot;Then we better find a way out of here.&quot; I look around for every exit. The Merlot are smitten with celebration because pride is their greatest weakness, and when we turn from the stage, the guards stare daggers back at us.
&quot;It was when I lived beyond the walls that I learned an invaluable lesson, almost twenty-five years ago. I had a wonderful family. A son and a daughter that used to love me. A beautiful life&mdash; and even though it was only a speck in the hundred-and-fifty-nine years the Essence has kept me alive, I considered it the kindest years of my life. I lived in the time before the Fall Of Nordhaven. I was part of the last true Royal family. I served my time and earned my keep as a Mask of the Gods, working for true divinity. And after all that toil, I thought I finally got the peace I deserved.&quot; 
He points at all the audience members. I squint my eyes, transfixed by a strange tattoo on his arm.
&quot;All of you relish in that spot at the top of your provinces, your lavish parties, speaking under the guise of compassion for the lower classes, when really, all they are to you is just numbers.&quot; 
Some applaud his sentiment. Some laugh uncomfortably.
&quot;You couldn&apos;t care less about them. As long as we&apos;re happy that you keep them fed, that&apos;s all they are to you. &quot;
Silence.
&quot;Come on. Am I right?&quot;
Silence, then stale applause.
&quot;Like cattle. Those shitbloods are cattle.&quot;
The Merlot squirm at that word. I heard it a couple times during the Merlotan parties as an offhand joke. But they still clap and applaud to appease their source of income.
&quot;I didn&apos;t believe there were two classes of Humans until the day that tore everything from me. They were taken from me by a thieving Snowdrifter they left nothing behind. And when I returned to the aftermath, I saw my dying child was suffocating on his own blood . . . and it reminded me of that same day I watched my mother and father die because they were too weak, our capitol swarmed by hordes and hordes of Chymaeran separatists. Why did my mother and father fail? And why did I fail my son?&quot;
He pauses for effect. A couple draw nervous sips, waiting for their dinner to finally arrive though no one&apos;s taken our order.
&quot;Because we made concessions for weakness. My mother and father said the Chymaerans could be good. And I thought Snowdrifters and lower people wouldn&apos;t resort to such desperacy to scrounge the disgusting, meager scraps it takes to power their Essenceless, emancipated shells of bodies. The only way we can grow as a race is to purge the blight of weakness, and that&apos;s why you&apos;re all gathered here today.&quot;
He raises his glass.
&quot;Another toast to the Merlot: the last tether between the top and the bottom.&quot;
Only several can muster a drink before the fits of coughing fill the hall. One woman falls out of her chair, and her husband and children jump to her rescue. It&apos;s only when I hear the Vermillion girls pound the table beside me that Lyra jumps from her seat, a sudden realization branded on her face.
&quot;Poison?&quot; I ask her. &quot;What is it?&quot;
Ullrich continues: &quot;...no better than your counterparts, you still wreak of weakness and disease. But, even through the death of my only rightful heir, my firstborn son, I have still found my replacement.&quot;
A familiar face approaches the stage. My heart hurts when I look upon her face again, just as I left her in the last life. She drips black bile as she comes out of her Chymaeran form.
&quot;And you will all be the catalysts of this change. Just as you served in life, through death, you will bring glory to the next golden age!&quot;
The panic quickly transitions from sharp screams to gargling and choking in their own liquefied flesh, and when one stumbling man rushes the stage, Ullrich kicks him, leaving a large dent in his dissolving body like kicking clay. The two Vermillion woman suffer before me, and I lament the promise I made to that Ellie from another life that stands onstage, as I&apos;m forced to choose.
I slit the side of my wrist in the same place Raine once showed me with a dull knife, and then slash hers. It cuts like steak: I know if I waited any longer, it might slice off her whole hand like butter with a hot knife. 
I press our wrists together. Her blood exits her veins in clumps of ooze as ruddy amethyst as the wine. And when our blood unifies, I feel the Essence flood from my body into hers.
&quot;Sum . . . ver . . . Titus . . .&quot; Valentina gurgles. If I don&apos;t hold her, I fear she might splatter on the floor. Her skin is soft, but it&apos;s getting firmer, and the pale complexion of her flesh returns.
&quot;Save her!&quot; Valentina cries, and when her muscles return enough to force me aside in the chair, casting me to the floor, she reaches out to grasp her sister, pushing aside Lyra.
She pushes a little too hard when she touches her and part of her shoulder scrapes off. Vera can&apos;t manage a word. Her clothes fade from their brilliant pink color and her eyes are obsidian just like the rest of her, sinking, like a black wax statue baking in a kiln.
I watch as Valentina scoops the piece from the table and presses it back onto her arm, getting as much as she can, though it&apos;s like spilling stew across the table. She tries to sculpt her sister back to life as she weeps and screams, while Lyra takes her other arm to try to transfer her Essence the same way I did.
&quot;Gods damn it!&quot; She screams. &quot;Why, why did you have to drink it all?&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s no use,&quot; Lyra says.
&quot;You&apos;re not giving up, do you hear me?&quot; Val snaps. &quot;Please, Vera. . . &quot; She keeps trying to hold her up. She uses her whole body to try to stabilize the mess of obsidian clay as Vera gurgles her last words, wet and voiceless, like bubbles from the lightless bottom of Blackwater lake. Vera dissolves through her sister&apos;s fingers before she can amass into anything, mutilating Valentina&apos;s left cheek with one last drag of her fused stump of a wrist.
Valentina shrieks when she knows it&apos;s hopeless. She grasps a knife on the table and surprises me as I&apos;m sprawled across the floor, watching Endogeny amass itself with the corpses of dead Merlotan families. 
What&apos;s worse is that the children were too young to drink: they were the last to go.
Valentina straddles me, sobbing as she holds the knife to my neck, pleading with every breath. &quot;Please. Please, you have to . . . go . . . back . . .&quot;
&quot;I can&apos;t anymore,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;Yes, yes you can. It&apos;s still there!&quot;She holds up my arm to show the single thread, and when I look at her face, the jawline of her left cheek scarred with swollen bumps from Vera&apos;s last touch like severe acne scars.
&quot;I&apos;m never going back, Valentina! The world will never be enough. Even with perfection will be loss,&quot; I say, though I hate myself for so strongly considering it.
&quot;No. Just . . . just kill yourself, please, for me, for my family...&quot; she pleads. &quot;They&apos;ll be distraught. I&apos;ll do it. I&apos;ll do it for you if I have to, and it will be quick, I can...&quot;
An arm grabs her wrist before she can act, and the knife clatters to the floor. 
It&apos;s Ullrich.
&quot;What does she mean by &apos;going back?&apos;&quot; Ullrich asks. &quot;Going back where?&quot;
&quot;You bastard!&quot; Valentina cries, lunging from the floor to stab him in the leg, but he knees her in the head and she crumples.
&quot;I thought I heard you were going back,&quot; he says. My muscles tension to prepare for a kick to the face, but instead, he lifts me to my feet as Endogeny dissolves out of the windows, shattering the glass, leaving the floors entirely black as the only evidence there were ever hundreds of souls living in this space, and he grabs my wrist, only to find the single line that Goddess Sylvia left me.
&quot;I&apos;m not going back. There&apos;s no reason to go down to the lower city after this,&quot; I say.
He laughs. &quot;Right, right.&quot;
Lyra stands up without a scar though her fingers are stained with the black streaks of Endogeny.
&quot;So you ended up as a servant to the Vermillion,&quot; Ullrich tells her. &quot;They were the top three greatest Merlotan families, so your friend should be proud. I allowed them to go peacefully as a final gift, though it looks like your province didn&apos;t want it.&quot; He&apos;s smiling despite everything, so happy that he might cry. &quot;It&apos;s just that I&apos;ve loved this moment every time. I enjoy that speech, but this, being here with my daughter, and...&quot; He turns to look at me.
The Heiress approaches from behind him. She doesn&apos;t recognize me, or she refuses to, so saturated with the hate and hunger for blood it makes her shudder.
&quot;The three of you withstood the trials of Endogeny. You are Essenced. And I believe you deserve a chance to prove yourself.&quot; He gestures to the unscathed Royal Guardsmen standing in the corner. &quot;I will put you up in my statehouse until I can finish what I began, so I can ensure that I will succeed this time.&quot;
He turns to Valentina, so distraught with grief that she refuses to part from her sister&apos;s residue on the floor.
&quot;What will we do with this one?&quot; Ullrich asks, and the Heiress approaches her.
&quot;No! She&apos;s with us,&quot; I say.
&quot;So you got a girlfriend, son?&quot; He asks.
&quot;Y-yeah. I&apos;m in love with her.&quot;
&quot;Even with that fucked-up side of her face? What, are you gonna put a bag over her head?&quot; He says, though the scarring is really not that bad. &quot;Then prove it,&quot; he says, as the Heiress lifts her from the floor to her feet. &quot;Prove it to me.&quot;
&quot;You mean...&quot; I say, but his expression is resolute, and he grows impatient.
&quot;Fucking do it,&quot; Ullrich says. The Heiress sharpens her human arm into an obsidian lance.
I press my lips against Valentina&apos;s for a peck. They&apos;re soft, caked with lip gloss, and I dwell just a little longer, until I feel that I&apos;ve been there for long enough.
&quot;Convince me, damn it!&quot;
I violate her mouth with my tongue, but she doesn&apos;t recoil, pulling herself in instead while she chokes on remorseful tears. My hand grasps behind her head and I stabilize her, like making out with a corpse.
&quot;Alright! That&apos;s more like it,&quot; Ullrich says, turning to Vera. &quot;Wasn&apos;t that great, Lyra? I wish you could find love like that. I had him all lined up for you, that was&mdash; before you abandoned this family.&quot; He expects a rebuttal, but instead she looks like she&apos;s about to throw up.
&quot;Now go. You earned your chance to witness my work,&quot; he says, and the Heiress releases her. Valentina stumbles forward into my chest and buries herself there, her ears brushing my cheeks, continuing to sob as she wraps her arms weakly around my shoulders. Before we can answer, the Royal Guard usher us out from the blackened hall into the pearlescent foyer, leaving black footprints on the granite that will never wash away."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Afterlives","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Ten","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Fifty-One","ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":10,"ChapterFull":51,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":163,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"158","Synopsis":"What would happen if the Vermillions made it there?","Summary":"","VerboseID":"5.51","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

The Grandmaster General&apos;s loft is just a stone&apos;s throw away from the grand hall: its windows open to the plaza and the front of the building, so Valentina has no chance to escape that visceral loss. But she doesn&apos;t want to. She sits at the window for almost three hours, staring at the shadows as they crawl across the grass as if her sister&apos;s soul inches towards her, reaching out to take her to whatever purgatory exists between the living and the dead.
I finally find the courage to say something to her &mdash; anything, even though I know it will never be good enough. 
&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; I tell her. 
&quot;It&apos;s not your fault.&quot; Valentina draws a long breath. &quot;You made a choice. And I should just be thankful that you made one. It&apos;s just . . . when a person dies and their soul leaves, you know that they&apos;re gone, right? There&apos;s one state and another. Alive or dead. But not Vera. She&apos;s . . .&quot; Valentina presses her head against the window. Her fingers caress the scar her sister left on her face. &quot;And I&apos;m sorry I asked you to do that unspeakable thing.&quot;
&quot;You were in pain, and for that, I can forgive you. Because I know exactly how you feel.&quot;
Lyra listens in from the room that used to be hers. &quot;There will be so many more casualties if we don&apos;t act now. I don&apos;t even want to know the world that was left for Fletch... ...er, Titus all those other times. We need to support the Carmine..&quot;
&quot;I just don&apos;t get it,&quot; I say. &quot;Why didn&apos;t he kill us? Or take us captive? Why did he just take us out of the fight and put us up in his loft?&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t know. But maybe he left something important behind.&quot; She motions for me to follow her, and we walk down the narrow hall until we stop at the last door.
&quot;Locked. It was always locked,&quot; she says, trying the handle though she knows it won&apos;t give, but then it does, and she stumbles into the room, taking a couple steps before she trips over a mass of fabric.
The smell of ozone hits as soon as the atmosphere settles. It&apos;s freezing. The cold air sucks the heat from the hall, and Valentina surprises me when her head bumps my shoulder. Lyra struggles to her feet, and it&apos;s dark until I throw open the curtains, casting light on shelves and shelves of colored spines. An ancient family painting stretches across the wall, opposite the windows: two ornately-dressed adults and four dark-haired children. I&apos;m certain they&apos;re true royalty from the way they&apos;re all dressed.
Lyra lifts the purple mass of fabric from the floor, and it&apos;s a bag. One of the straps is torn off while the other hangs on by a thread.
Valentina connects its relevance before I can speak. &quot;Ellie. That&apos;s her bag,&quot; She says. &quot;But how did it get up here?&quot;
I look closer at the framed pictures on the desk, and the faces glare back at me. &quot;She disappears every time. That&apos;s because it&apos;s Ullrich that takes her.&quot;
&quot;But why? She&apos;s just a child, what does she have to do with anything?&quot;
&quot;She has my Essence, my rightful blood, and no curse holding her back from becoming a Mask of the Gods. She is a Mask of the Humans and Chymaera. And she&apos;s the one that made Endogeny,&quot; I tell them.
Valentina is at a loss for words, and when Lyra tries to unroll the top of the bag, the last strap finally gives, crashing Ellie&apos;s tattered backpack to the ground, casting something metallic across the floor and under the desk. My circuits throb with Essence, and my head aches so strongly that my eyes rattle in their sockets. Lyra groans at the sudden impulse. Valentina jumps at the new sensation of Essence, feeling her skin to see if she suddenly runs a fever.
I don&apos;t have to reach for it to know what it is&mdash; the devastating potential it holds&mdash; and I wonder why Ullrich would leave it so easily unguarded, why he didn&apos;t give it to the Heiress to help in his harvest of Essenced souls.
The loft felt so empty until this moment. We wait with baited breath, listening to every creak of the floors below, wondering if they&apos;ll climb to our level and bash open the door, if maybe they&apos;re outside the window, if they&apos;re in the other rooms just waiting to bust in and execute us where we stand.
I find a familiar portrait on his desk when I hold my breath, and it makes me gasp for air, pulsing my heart with a panic stronger than the flux in my circuits. It&apos;s the graduation picture I never ordered, taken weeks before my speech with a single caption: FLETCHER.
&quot;We need to get out of here. He knows who I am. He&apos;s known this whole time, but how? And why, why did he wait?&quot; I ask, reaching beneath the desk to grasp the Amulet, despite how much it numbs my flesh and halts the blood in my veins.
&quot;Because I wanted to believe that you&apos;d stay,&quot; Ullrich says. &quot;You&apos;d tell me eventually. I only learned hours from now&mdash; yet I could still order your picture before it came. I was so elated to know my children can be alive during the time I struggle here. But that doesn&apos;t change what I have to do &mdash;for you, for us, and for everyone.&quot;
&quot;What is he talking about?&quot; Valentina asks. &quot;Your father is Clint, Titus.&quot;
&quot;Clint is my nephew, and old Everett is my brother. Gods, how much the lack of Essence aged him. Though he insisted to live the short rest of it atoning for his sins. How would it be different if he knew the child he let die was his grandson, alive and well? Would he still create that monster to try to take the Afterlife down?&quot;
Ullrich steps in the foyer, accompanied by four Chymaeran guards as silent as a whisper. He drags a tall statue to the window without an explanation, as our backs press against the bookshelf, cornered like rats, as I hold the last piece of divinity left to Blackwater.
&quot;I&apos;m giving you a choice, my son&mdash; my daughter&mdash; and I&apos;d like to believe there&apos;s free will, even if I know what you&apos;ll decide. Return it to me and we&apos;ll live a beautiful life up here. Your friend can stay. And when the time comes, you&apos;ll be born again to another life, a better life, free from the toil of these soul-crushing politics, and I&apos;ll do it right. You&apos;ll have a mother, a father, and if I gain enough Essence, the grandparents you never met. But you have to give it to me.&quot;
He catches me looking at the tattoo on his arm, but it&apos;s bumps that disfigure all the way down to both his wrists.
&quot;I should show you now that you know the truth.&quot; He takes off his jacket, then unbuttons the top of his shirt. Across his chest are tens of thousands of fine threads of all sizes, as if a sweater were woven into his flesh. They all cowlick in a circle at the left-center of his chest where his heart is.
&quot;I&apos;ve counted them, over and over and over, and every single time, no matter how close I get, it&apos;s always an impasse&mdash; with you, or that annoying girlfriend of yours as tall as the sky, or your friends, or by accident, old age, even natural causes.&quot; His eyes are fanatical: a gambler addicted to the requited cycle of gain and loss. &quot;But, Gods be damned, am I so close this time, like you wouldn&apos;t believe, and&mdash;&quot;
He dodges.
I cast a fireball at his head.
A vision flashes and I duck right, just as both flaming orbs scald the corners of the room.
&quot;You got me once like that. You thought you&apos;d surprise me. Heck, I bet your friends here don&apos;t even know what you learned in some other cycle of life. But tell me, son: how did you know to duck?&quot;
I say, &quot;I . . I don&apos;t know, I . . .&quot;
&quot;Feel like you&apos;ve&mdash;&quot; He says.
&quot;Been here before?&quot; We both say.
Ullrich says, &quot;Then why? Why is it that you can&apos;t remember? Shouldn&apos;t you have seen everything? Every reset? Why else do you think it is that you never remember killing me? And why do I never remember killing you?&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s because we&apos;re blocking each other.&quot;
&quot;All we have left is a war of spirit and will, and right now, you have far too much to lose.&quot;
The guards grab Lyra as the fire catches the drapes.
&quot;I&apos;ve seen it all. You have no surprise, no avenue of escape. Our family died the minute this world took that terrible twist. And you&apos;re only it&apos;s long shadow. My real daughter, my real son&mdash; they&apos;re still back there.&quot;
&quot;And that&apos;s exactly the kind of thinking that nearly destroyed me. You should have let go a long time ago!&quot; I feel embers scald my neck. The bookshelf snaps from the weight of burned paper, but I don&apos;t dare turn around.
&quot;What&apos;s it going to be this time? Are you going to leave your sister to die? I know every escape you&apos;ll try to make!&quot;
I struggle to decide. I can&apos;t come up with anything. He&apos;s in my head, and every time another idea rises, it feels like I&apos;ve seen it all play out before.
I grab Valentina&apos;s hand before the crossbeam snaps. We jump to the window to dodge the falling debris, yet Ullrich stands in the only safe space in the middle of the floor with his hand tightened on the fabric of Vera&apos;s collar.
&quot;You do better when you rush the door, but either way, that piece of pure Essence is going to be mine, and I&apos;m going all the way back this time.&quot;
I fail to remember the statue&apos;s right in front of me, and so I rack my left hand against its head, dropping the pendant on the floor. Our momentum is too strong to turn around. We shatter out the glass, breaking through the first boards of scaffolding before rolling across a flimsy bridge of wooden planks. Valentina&apos;s light enough to stop, but I&apos;m too heavy, and so I barely catch the edge before I fall another two stories.
&quot;I look forward to when you come back, Titus. You&apos;ll never reach as far as I can. You say you can deal with death and sacrifice, but can you deal with the disfigurement of your friends? Or will it crush your spirit?&quot;
I watch helplessly from between the slats. Lyra begs for her life, though our father never intends to take it by his own hands.
He kicks her out the window.
She flails helplessly as she reaches for a bar to grab the scaffolding, but there&apos;s nothing there: not a board, a burlap sack, nothing but a single bar that resonates when her spine snaps, folding her in two for a brief second before she falls into the fountain below.
&quot;All you had to do was stay, Titus. You can choose better next time,&quot; he says, and before my fear can stop me, I&apos;ve already jumped into the murky fountain, along with Valentina, cradling my sister as she cries that she can&apos;t feel her legs.
The water was red before I made the second splash. She can barely breathe, and I have to forcibly raise her above the water, her useless legs floating in the water.
&quot;It wasn&apos;t supposed to end this way, Lyra,&quot; I sob. &quot;I can go back. I can fix this!&quot;
&quot;Don&apos;t,&quot; she whispers. &quot;You&apos;ve done the best you can. I&apos;m so happy I can leave with everything I ever wanted. And look&mdash; I paid it back.&quot;
Her head bobs beneath the surface when the weakness flows out of her in plumes of crimson. I feel the energy rise in my circuits when she finally opens her hand, releasing the celestial stone of pure Essence that sinks to the bottom of the fountain.
There&apos;s no time before Ullrich will realize the twist he never expected. We make for the abandoned building next door. I refuse to let go, and with everything I can afford, I transfer my Essence just to stabilize her. She&apos;s losing blood fast, and I try to cauterize her wounds with the heat from my fingers. 
It&apos;s when she doesn&apos;t react to the scalding heat that I realize she&apos;s gone.
The only choice we have is to go on, and once more, I can feel that breadth of time separate us from our last living moment together. I take Valentina&apos;s hand as we limp out from the crimson fountain, refusing to look back and watch as my dead sister sinks beneath the surface."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":109,"ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":10,"ChapterFull":51,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":109,"Index":165,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"160","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Trapped by stone walls and gates on all sides in a closed area, he hobbles through an old, desecrated church that depicts the Human goddess Khiras that Titus saw in his first life.

The dilapidated building is an old chapel dating back to the earliest days of Blackwater, surrounded in scaffolding, ready for demolition, as it might be the last organically gray building in the pure Afterlife. I bash my shoulder through the wooden double doors. The celestial stone is in my pocket, radiating my entire body with energy as if it were a hollow vessel filled with boiling water. The gothic windows are all boarded with planks. Half the statues are covered with cloth, as if they were messengers for the Gods that might tell of this temple&apos;s adulteration. Our boots crunch the stained glass on the floor to colored sand, and as lukewarm winds whistle through the slats, we search for anywhere we can escape, or at least, to hide.
I&apos;ve seen so much death in all these cycles&mdash; enough that I convinced myself I was used to loss, unfazed by change when it could all be written over. But now I know the pain only comes when the cycle is refused, when I force myself to know it&apos;s the last chance. But is it?
I set down Lyra when we reach a patch of smooth ground. She curls in the letter &apos;c&apos; when I rest her against the wall, and the feeling crushes me.
&quot;Maybe this doesn&apos;t have to be the last one,&quot; I whisper to Valentina, as we limp through the lifeless corridors. &quot;Maybe he&apos;s right. Maybe I can go back. I can get an advantage on him, it&apos;s the only way.&quot;
&quot;No, you can&apos;t think like that,&quot; she says.
&quot;I can&apos;t live with the weight. I thought I could accept it, but the entire world is my fault: my sister grievously hurt, your sister, dead, without honor for no reason at all, and this is only the beginning. I believed. I thought this would all turn out better, but it&apos;s all slipping . . . again . . . and I swear, to the stone Gods and Goddesses that listen in this temple, I can still hear their screams.&quot;
She grabs the hem of Romin&apos;s tattered suit jacket to stop me for a moment. &quot;I spent my whole life telling myself that the world was my fault. That she hated me because I was a terrible daughter. In that cellar, I&apos;d run the perfect string of words over and over, convinced if I just found the right combination I might break through, just get my foot in the door, that maybe the locks could come off.&quot;
&quot;You thought there was a perfect answer.&quot;
&quot;That&apos;s right, and no matter how good I got at studying people and reading their emotions, building my craft until I made it a profession, commanding enough to stir an audience to tears or make them laugh at imaginary characters in a script&mdash; I still couldn&apos;t do it.&quot;
&quot;But why would you keep trying?&quot;
&quot;Because I was addicted to the vision of something I couldn&apos;t have, that I would never have. And you gave me a chance to see clearly for the first time. You gave me that courage to stand up for it, and let that impossible vision die before it hurt me any more.&quot;
&quot;So then where do I draw the line? You can live in the comfort of knowing you made that choice and you can&apos;t go back, Val, but what if this <em>is</em> my life purpose?&quot;
&quot;Purpose is tied to meaning and concrete goals. My suffering was meaningless. And my goal was to make my family love me again. What is yours?&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t even know what good enough looks like. I just know I&apos;m not there yet,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;And will you be? Will Ullrich ever be?&quot;
The thread is still there on my wrist, the last line untethered unlike before. It might never show its frayed ends if I continue, but the promise to Ellie feels like shallow words of foolish passion.
Valentina says, &quot;My sister died horrifically, stupidly, but after I spent a long time thinking about it, I realize that doesn&apos;t mean it wasn&apos;t meaningful.&quot;
It&apos;s so dark. When I close my eyes, I can still see the house I left, those last moments with the woman I love, and the mother I missed all those lonely years.
Valentina says, &quot;I mean, I think so. It has to be, right?&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m not sure anymore,&quot; I tell her.
The ancient halls open to a broad, central chapel, where fleeting rays of sunlight pour through the high windows like golden wax. What&apos;s left of the crushed pews tells they were meant to face us, away from the stage, towards the statues of nameless Gods replaced by mortals that think themselves their equal.
Spirits of azure flame begin to dance in the hollow space, harmless when they graze the fabric of our tattered clothes.
&quot;You can take that piece of Pure Essence, but it brings you nowhere closer to anything. Give it to the daughter of Khiras, unable to harness Her power, and all of Blackwater will be destroyed. Use it yourself, and your threads will jettison all its power into the atmosphere. Give it to Lyra and nothing will happen. Only I can make anything of it.&quot;
His voice booms from the second floor. The flames coalesce into large shapes.
&quot;What, are you going to burn us out?&quot;
&quot;I want to tell you a story. Because regardless of who lives or dies, only memory survives these loops for the two of us.&quot;
His hands raise past the railing. We stand in the center while Lyra leans against the wall. The flames congeal in glowing clouds of blue plasma, covering every edge of the circular sanctum until a flat plane obscures the floor, making our feet disappear.
&quot;This timeline is all an illusion, Titus. I&apos;m taking us back to them. The real you is back there, the real Lyra, before the incident in the house. I&apos;m gonna raise you so you never end up alone. I&apos;ll raise you as the next Mask. I&apos;ll teach you everything I know. I&apos;ll say all the things you should have heard, that I was too late to ever tell you,&quot; he says. The luminescent smoke condenses into rugged bumps, and I recognize it as terrain: the landmarks he&apos;s committed to memory are sharp and distinct while the rest is fuzzy.
Valentina and I realize that we stand within the walls of Blackwater, and we&apos;re divided by the central peaks. Countless forested hills are scattered around the walls, and it feels as if I&apos;m Sylvia&apos;s divine form, watching from high above the clouds.
The entire map translates somewhere long past the hills and trees, somewhere the ice stops, and we see it: the terrain dotted with shrubs and trees just like the Afterlife, but everywhere, and I wonder how much Essence it would take to ever have that much heat. 
&quot;This was the cradle of humanity. It was our birthright. And it was beautiful,&quot; he says. We shrink until we&apos;re as tall as the bordering mountains, and the landscape settles, so many boxes of buildings and stretches of open land coming into view. It&apos;s a massive city, far grander than anything I&apos;ve ever seen, at least ten times the size of small Blackwater.
&quot;We were so strong. We had true power in numbers, Essence, but all that was taken from us. A hundred years ago, the fall of Nordhaven crippled us, attacked by Chymaeran and Ahkvasan separatists.&quot;
It mystifies me how such a massive city could crumble to the will of any army in such a short time. But then I see it: volleys of Essence that eviscerate entire lines of the city at a time; divine agents I could only recognize as the Masks of other races; such a strength in numbers and formless familiars that civilians could stand no chance.
&quot;You can&apos;t go back because you weren&apos;t around yet. Not even I can go back that far. But the Goddess gave me this thread as a secret mission, to restore humanity to its greatest state, to wipe the slate clean of everything that should have never come to exist. So can&apos;t you see, Titus? There is no guilt when none of this is real!&quot;
&quot;But it is, Ullrich, can&apos;t you see? This is the life that fate chose before you ever went back to reverse it.&quot;
&quot;Then you&apos;re too complacent to know what it means to dream bigger. Your pathetic life below the clouds is all you&apos;ve known, with what&mdash; that pathetic father that was too drunk to show at your graduation? Your dead mother? Thankless sister? Hunger and desperation and loneliness when you deserve to be raised right? I can take all of that away.&quot;
&quot;It made me who I am. Sure, this world is torture. It hurts to exist, to be alive, to admit defeat and mourn all the ways life could have been different. But this is our world, meant for one shot. And I&apos;ll live with its joys, or be damned with it.&quot;
&quot;Then I hope the next version of you is less blinded by that pathetic helplessness,&quot; Ullrich says, casting an explosive fire charge against the top of the chapel. &quot;Now go back and give up. You can still save Lyra!&quot;
The crack spreads across the ceiling. Gravel raps the top of my skull. We&apos;re in the middle of  the floor, and I know if I don&apos;t act now, we&apos;ll be buried in a mass stone grave, though I&apos;m far more concerned of what it might do to the lone thread on my wrist.
The distant wall crumbles as Ullrich escapes out the top balcony. That same feeling of hopelessness I felt in past lives metastasizes in my muscles, freezing me entirely, and I panic, though I feel something ripped from my pocket as I turn around.
&quot;We&apos;re not giving up. Their sacrifice was not in vain,&quot; she says, and when I open my eyes, I no longer hear the clatter of rubble cascading from the ceiling. She holds the piece of pure Essence in her hands with a devout look of determination, her radiant jade eyes piercing as the world decelerates around us.
She grabs me at the wrist, dragging me towards the entrance from whence we came, watching with panic as meteoric masses of stone shatter the aged tile, falling gracefully with the slowness of entropy until they nearly halt. The air feels thin when our momentum grows in the atrophy of time, and when I collide with the fractals of multicolor shattered, stained glass, they spin in place as if fixed to the ceiling by a piece of string, though with the slightest touch they still slice my clothes.
She tugs me in front of her, pushing behind me to make me go faster, and it frightens me when I remember how history might repeat itself again. We can still see the grand arch of the entry door intact because of its shape, the light of the reflective pool catching our eyes, casting a halo around the dark edges of debris, and when the boulders scrape away strands of my jet-black hair, crunching us down to a near crawl to avoid the crippling forces stronger than a hundred men apiece, we finally dive for the daylight, and in the last moment, Valentina pushes me.
I crash into the edge of the fountain, straining my back as the trickle of time returns to a full flood, filling the air with clouds of dust. I plunge into the bloody fountain, bashing into my sister that still floats there, helplessly, and I&apos;m praying to whatever Gods may listen that I didn&apos;t lose another. 
I feel something cold and wet grab my leg and it startles me. My mind jumps to the sickly tendrils of Endogeny, and so I kick my legs, driving my head against the edge of the fountain as it releases, sitting with my back turned to the desecrated chapel.
It&apos;s Lyra.
I see that her chest still rises and falls. She&apos;s lost a lot of blood, but she still hangs on to life, and I reach to ferry her across the pool. I surely lost a friend, and if my family still persists, I&apos;m going to save her at any cost.
&quot;Don&apos;t lift her,&quot; the voice says. Her feet splash in the shallow water, covering the distance of twenty meters in a matter of mere seconds, with the amulet still in her hand.
&quot;Val, you made it,&quot; I say. My voice quavers. &quot;You didn&apos;t . . . or, I thought you&mdash;&quot;
&quot;I have too much reason to live. I&apos;ve got a life to avenge and family to protect. And you do, too,&quot; she replies, gesturing towards my sister as she hands me the Amulet.

We find two steel-poled flags between the wreckage of the chapel and the scaffolding, adorned with the pure white sigil of the Afterlife. I instruct Valentina to face them opposite each other, and we roll them in, forming a canvas stretcher we use to scoop Lyra from the fountain.
&quot;I can&apos;t use this. No,&quot; Lyra says, when I give her the piece of pure Essence to stabilize her. &quot;I would have died for a reason. I can&apos;t feel my legs, Titus. I&apos;m useless! I&apos;m not worth it!&quot;
&quot;No. Ullrich was right that the piece of pure Essence is useless to us. It&apos;s only useful to keep it from him.&quot;
&quot;Why can&apos;t you use it?&quot; Valentina asks.
&quot;I can&apos;t become a Mask with this thread tethered to my arm.&quot;
&quot;Then why don&apos;t you tear it?&quot;
&quot;Because I don&apos;t know the consequence. And if it does happen . . . who knows how long I&apos;ll have after that,&quot; I say.
She still hesitates to tap into its power. I&apos;m still dumbstruck at its influence on Valentina.
&quot;Use it,&quot; I tell her. &quot;I&apos;m telling you to go ahead.&quot;
&quot;But what if&mdash;&quot;
&quot; What if, nothing, Lyra! I&apos;m not losing you.&quot;
She inspects the celestial pebble within the amulet before she tensions her fingers on it. Valentina used just a little, but it&apos;s notably smaller in size, like peeling the skin off a grape. We can feel it&apos;s influence as I carry the front and Valentina lifts the back.
&quot;What now?&quot; Valentina asks.
&quot;We pray our friends hold fast in the foothills,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Ullrich knows that, if his consciousness continues, either I&apos;m still alive or I followed my same series of choices. So all we can do is join the fight below.&quot;
I&apos;m surprised that the Royal Guardsmen never show up to capture or kill us. I pray it&apos;s because they&apos;re occupied at the walls, trying to deter the city&apos;s full attack. I pray the Merlot listen to the Vermillion family&apos;s warning, though I doubt prayer will get me anywhere that raw effort can&apos;t.
&quot;It will take forever to walk back,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;She needs attention now.&quot;
&quot;I&apos;ll be alright. Look, it&apos;s working, just a little bit, but it&apos;s working,&quot; Lyra says. I see her big toe distort the fabric of the flags as she tries to move it.
&quot;That&apos;s great, Lyra. But we&apos;re not going to be able to take you that way&mdash;&quot; I look past a section of wall that was crunched by a chapel column, finding nothing more than a mile of dense, un-traversable foliage dotted with bushes.
&quot;Then how will we make it back?&quot;
There&apos;s only one real option. &quot;It depends on if you can drive without crashing,&quot; I tell her.

&quot;I&apos;m gonna crash!&quot; She shouts.
&quot;No, you&apos;re not! Just focus on the road,&quot; I insist, as I duck behind the tattered white fabric, scorched with burning holes from the three pearlescent touring cars chasing us. &quot;Gods be damned, this is too fast to not be riding rails&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Just hold on. Keep targeting them,&quot; Valentina says.
&quot;Ellie barely taught me to fire standing still!&quot;
I couldn&apos;t find it in me to kill the guard that was sitting in the driver&apos;s seat. It was easy to choke him out since he was younger than me, just a twig: strong from the Essence, but his muscles weren&apos;t trained by poverty and hard labor. He must have ratted us off as soon as he came to.
Lyra tries to give me the Amulet, sprawled in the back between the flags.
&quot;No, you need that,&quot; I tell her.
&quot;Take it. Just don&apos;t let your blood touch it.&quot;
Valentina hits a large rock, casting us upwards, and Lyra gets a near second of air time. I nearly disappear out the top before I duck back in, missing a fire blast by the length of my hair. I regain my composure and tighten my hands around the pure Essence, feeling it flow through one arm and out the other.
&quot;Hold steady, Val. Get us steady for a second!&quot; I try to aim, but it&apos;s not like throwing a ball. More like peeing in a bush, except the bush is three moving cars with highly-trained, Essenced Guardsmen, and the hose is my arm, churning with such Essence I&apos;m not sure if the next blast will throw me out towards the untreaded road faster than this stolen ride.
Valentina is trying. But the dirt back road snakes left and right. I&apos;m not sure how precise I have to be, whether it will cone short and wide like a shotgun blast, or a direct line of ray energy. The three cars are never together. The only thing that&apos;s constant are the projectile flames pelting to the left and the right of us, and their aim is getting better.
&quot;We&apos;re coming up on a straightaway,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;They&apos;ll all have a direct shot!&quot;
&quot;And so will I,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Straighten out, just for a second.&quot; I grasp it harder, almost enough to bend the outer shell, and I can feel the energy resonate my entire body at the same frequency, almost enough to make me vomit, aside from Valentina&apos;s reckless driving. I hold my breath try to aim, and then I trigger that imaginary muscle that Ellie taught me.
My arm buckles. I hit myself in the face as the Amulet slips from my grasp. For a moment I&apos;m blind, and I consider so much Essence has flooded out of my body that my senses have been destroyed, but I still feel the feeling of inertia &mdash; no longer the rugged jostling of Valentina&apos;s erratic driving, but only the motion of wind blowing back at my body.
My body thrashes with no surface to ground myself, and when my vision recovers as my ears ring, I realize I&apos;m in the air, at least twenty meters above the lush landscape, heading straight for a bank of pine trees on the side of the road, the flames still sputtering from my palm in stops and starts that shake me as I ragdoll in the air.
It feels as if I&apos;m in an out-of-body experience, watching Valentina&apos;s stolen car screech its tires as it brakes for me. As my back crunches the branches, pine needles stabbing my back and scratching my flesh, I cascade down the canopy. The last sight I catch is the crater in the dirt road: three hunks of scorched metal burning as the occupants writhe on the ground.
I grab for a branch. It snaps, and after a face full of needles, I grab again, holding tightly to the stabbing end of whatever&apos;s there. The branch swings me downwards, turning all my falling motion into collision with the trunk.
It might have saved my life, but I see stars when my back slams into the rugged ground, bashing my head against the bark of the tree&apos;s roots. Despite the bloodied scratches, I&apos;m lucky that I&apos;m mostly unscathed, watching as Valentina approaches from the road to help me to my feet.
The worst pain I feel is my right shoulder socket, my arm thrown back by such tremendous force that it strains on torn muscles. Grasping that branch saved my feet, though I paid for that fall with the headache.
We make it to the end of the only road we know, and the landscape is far more desolate than we left it. Sreaklines of tar denote the path of mindless consumption Endogeny took towards the lower hills, fueling itself with whatever it could acquire in the absence of living flesh. Valentina drives the pearlescent touring car into the hub, directly into the Vermilion lift, and the squealing brakes echo through the vacant chamber lit only by the opposite balcony. When we exit, we find the only other black skid marks not left by Valentina&apos;s driving: the desperate last stand of the lowly-Essenced attendant, tatters of his clothes left behind while all his organic matter is elsewhere.
We descend the lift as we watch from the balcony, uncertain of where the Merlot and Carmine&apos;s calamitous push advances in the span of a day. The only evidence we have of change is the smell of sulfur &mdash; from either distant pockets of flames far across the civilian landscape; gunpowder; or Essence used as a potent replacement for saltpeter.
To the west, the sky flashes in what Valentina and I naively mistake as lightning. Barely able to support herself against the railing with the amulet in her hand, Lyra tells that they&apos;re volleys of Essenced Chymaeran energy.
&quot;But that&apos;s near the Academy,&quot; Valentina says.
&quot;Then that means they&apos;re at the first command point. We&apos;re getting off,&quot; I say.

It took almost an hour of untended, winding service roads before the amethyst lightning grew any larger, and sprawled across the back seat of the touring car, Lyra looked like she&apos;s throw up at any moment. If it wasn&apos;t for me holding her shoulders to the seat with her head in my lap, she would have popped out of the car through the tattered fabric as soon as we drove off the freight lift.
The ambient sounds of discharging rifles tell us we&apos;re getting closer to the front lines. Ahead, we watch as scouting parties cross the road like rabbits, disappearing in the trees before we can see where they went.
A twosome surprises us on the road, their rifles raised although our headlights aren&apos;t on to blind them. With such a posh motorcar, rolling like a polished pearl on ruddy trails &mdash; were it not for the gaping hole in the ceiling and bullet holes all across the chassis, they would have shot us right away. Valentina tries to brake slowly, but a rock catches the rigid wheel, jolting us upwards, and Lyra grunts at the sudden shift.
&quot;What are you . . .&quot; The first stranger squints while the second still steadies their rifle. &quot;Who is that . . . Vera? Vera, is that you? Sweet Khiras above. And Titus!&quot;
The voice is Jarrett&apos;s, and he&apos;s joined by Delvin.
&quot;Isla&apos;s back at base camp. We need to get us all back together. Gods above, I didn&apos;t know when you were coming back.&quot;
&quot;Jarrett,&quot; Delvin says.
&quot;It was all such a shot in the dark, sending you all up there, and&mdash;&quot;
&quot;Jarrett, that&apos;s not Vera. That&apos;s Valentina,&quot; Delvin says. He looks at Lyra and I through the broken window. &quot;What happened to Vera, Titus?&quot;

We&apos;re in for a quiet ride after we tell them. Jarrett sits in the front with both their rifles. Delvin sits on the right seat, supporting Lyra&apos;s legs over his lap as he stares out the window, maybe hiding tears at the edge of exhaustion.
Jarrett says, &quot;Despite everything, your fireteam did it. I still don&apos;t know how you managed to pull it off.&quot;
&quot;Pull off what?&quot; I ask.
&quot;Most of the Merlot and Carmine in all the districts are allied together. They listened to Vincent&apos;s message. And we spread the message to the masses &mdash; some of the unaffiliated civilians have taken arms for our cause, while others are escaping towards the outer walls.  Romin and I just pray it buys enough time to stop whatever drives Endogeny.&quot;
&quot;Then we have to get to the inner walls fast,&quot; I say. 
&quot;Why don&apos;t we take the lift?&quot; Valentina asks.
&quot;Because it will be crawling with Afterlife after our escape: plus, it&apos;s far too slow,&quot; I say. I turn to Delvin. &quot;How are the others? Isla? Sylvia?&quot;
&quot;They&apos;re preparing their assault with the rest of the militia. If you&apos;re lucky, you&apos;ll catch them before they leave,&quot; he says.
It&apos;s only half an hour more, but every second on the winding roads make it feel so much longer. The other fireteam has no further words for their dead friend, and Valentina reflects their silent suffering, as if guilty that she&apos;s not her.
The car pulls into the Academy North campus, past the broken steel gates defended by Merlot and Carmine, and they wave to us. The campus is flooded with cadets, brave commoners, Merlotan guards, and Carmine brothers and sisters. The intercom repeats that THIS SPACE IS FOR ALLIED MILITIA ONLY &mdash; that all the other civilians are to egress towards the outer walls with all they can carry.
The one commonality is that all of them are walking the same way, towards the Foothills, and it&apos;s as if we drove through a cross-current of pink and crimson.
Surely enough, the Academy North administration building is the main operating base, well-furnished with supplies since they commandeered the gondola to carry all the munitions from the Carmine compound.
It&apos;s tremendous what the opposing factions can accomplish when they work together. I get a closer look at their members when I step out of the car, steadying Lyra as she heals herself with the Amulet. They wear the same clothes of their factions, but their membership patches are different. The whole base exchanged their faction&apos;s patch with the members of the other, giving all the militants a homogenous color scheme.
I ask one of the Merlotans. &quot;What&apos;s going on here?&quot;
&quot;Is that a joke? Get your things together. The next wave is moving out,&quot; he says, before joining his fireteam as the mass exodus makes for the mountain. I start to walk in their direction, but a hand tensions around my mark before I can go.
&quot;Whoa, there. Not you, buddy. We need you for later.&quot; 
It&apos;s Romin.
&quot;Our scouts saw you coming from afar. They were asking what a cloud was doing on the ground  and not in the air,&quot; he says.
Valentina embraces him with all her sorrow and he consoles her.
&quot;We need a medical team to help Lyra,&quot; I tell him. &quot;She&apos;s still in the car.&quot;
&quot;Sure.&quot; Romin pulls aside two Carmine cadets walking past, ordering them to go to the medical bay. &quot;You weren&apos;t gone for long. I was expecting to meet you on the other side of the wall. What happened up there?&quot;
Valentina gives him the short of it.
&quot;Gods above,&quot; he says, just as the medical team takes Lyra on our makeshift stretcher.
&quot;But we got something. And it won&apos;t be useful to us until we make it to the other side of the wall, and I have my chance.&quot;
Lyra passes it off to me before the medics can carry her upstream. The same resonance flutters my circuits, and only now does it hit me that this is the final push.
&quot;My father shared his Essence. I can feel that. What is it?&quot;
&quot;A fragment of Pure Essence. More than the First Red had in the Backwoods,&quot; I tell him. &quot;This was supposed to be in the house beyond the walls. I stole it back. And now we can use it to gain an edge on the source of Endogeny.&quot;
Romin gestures to the flood of militiamen making for the hills. I never knew there were this many fighting spirits in Blackwater. &quot;Let these fighters pave the way for our forces of destruction. We are all no longer divided. Between Merlot and Carmine, there is no other enemy beyond the false gods above the clouds. We will choke them out from all sides before Endogeny can extinguish us!&quot;"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"Purgatory Line","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":113,"ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":12,"ChapterFull":53,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":113,"Index":171,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"166","Synopsis":"","Summary":" REF 1.6.4

The true Humans of Blackwater might strain their muscles climbing the foothills to approach the outer walls of the Upper City, but to them, it&apos;s a true downhill battle.
The Afterlife might have generations of Essence they stored for this very moment, but they don&apos;t have that feverish determinism of the ones that were poor, desperate, and weak their whole lives: the ones willing to give everything, including themselves, for their people to live on. They launch their volleys of Essence without aim at the foothills. The ground dissolves. Bodies dissolve. The dirt and rock launches into the air, trapping dusk in a thin, timeless orange haze, yet we continue to run towards the walls, getting closer and closer, our lungs screaming for breath as we scale the incline further and further, guns blasting, axe-rifles chopping, screams of only agony or determination christening the air.
The first three waves were fodder. They knew their purpose but acted anyway, with so much anger to release the pains of death were incomparable. The next two waves were the ones that broke through Endogeny, carving a path in the black rubber ring of rancid gore, holding it off long enough for the demolition it&apos;s teams to establish a foothold. And now &mdash; as the final waves of the three northern provinces pierce the black bile, the pearlescent walls grow closer and closer.
&quot;Don&apos;t let it deceive you! There is nothing living left, not your friends, not your family, nothing,&quot; Romin shouts, as he slices through a tattered limb of Endogeny. Valentina&apos;s sister appeared to her three times, but each time she blew a hole through its chest, collapsing the Chymaeran chum to amorphousness.
Our team is immune to small patches of Endogeny. Though the great Chymaeran weapon churns cadets and combatants like toothless, cancerous gums, we wade through the middle passage, so close to the wall that Romin could throw a rock at it.
The Royal Guard are nervous atop the walls, exhausting their Essence to cast flames on the militiamen between the walls and Endogeny. I wonder how long we can hold the ring open. I wonder how the other partnered provinces fare in this grand campaign, whether they&apos;re just bait for the black bile, or if they&apos;re at their walls too, preparing the charges to crumble the walls.
The amulet is around my neck, sharing the same strong chain as my mother&apos;s Chymaeran marker. Romin&apos;s excitement climbs as we get closer. The central team carries the crates between the flank of human shields, keeping the precious cargo from the bile. It&apos;s when we make it halfway through the obsidian river that Romin huffs his orders.
&quot;Keep Endogeny from the wall, clear a space&mdash; we&apos;re blowing it!&quot;
They shim the boxes with boulders just to keep them upright. The Essenced explosives are packed with every last ounce of Essence the Merlotan families have, glowing bright crimson, waiting for a single spark to eviscerate everything.
&quot;Plant the charges!&quot; Romin barks, but they&apos;re already installing the explosives on the wall. The fighters behind us hold the line against suffocation in the bile. They cry under the force of odorous, decaying flesh and sinew reaching with uncanny hands to absorb them; chopping and slicing between heaving breaths just like we are; and the more it builds, the quicker we realize that the mass is conscious enough to understand what we&apos;re doing.
&quot;Romin, get them to hurry up!&quot; I say. Endogeny absorbs a Merlotan&apos;s hand when he slips on his swing, and the Merlotan soldier cries out in fear &mdash; though I know Endogeny&apos;s toxic make-up mutes all the pain.
&quot;Almost there, just hold a little longer,&quot; Romin orders. The ring is closing on itself. Soon we&apos;ll separated from the fighters on the other side of Endogeny, enclaved between the tar and the pearlescent wall.
The demolitionists retreat with the detonation line just as Endogeny is about to close. We redouble our forces on the inner walls, parting the sea of tar like a bad haircut, just a little longer until we can clear the blast radius, back-to-back as Endogeny tries to repair itself.
Our muscles tense, and we cover our ears, prepares for the blast, just as Romin opens his mouth to issue the order.
&quot;Blow it.&quot;
One of the Merlotan militants drives down the plunger. I close my eyes to save my sight from the blast, holding my breath as I take blind slashes at the mess of conscious black tar. But nothing happens.
The Merlotan frantically drives the plunger twice more. Jarrett pulls at the wire, and we realize that a chunk of Endogeny dissolved the cable, severing us from our deliverance.
&quot;Gods damn it,&quot; Romin shouts.
&quot;We can&apos;t hold much longer,&quot; Valentina insists, and my arms strain under the exhaustion. My back presses hard against another Carmine brother. Deterring flames bellow from my palms. We&apos;ll be compressed by the tar if we don&apos;t act immediately. Not even my threads could change this outcome.
&quot;It&apos;s time, then,&quot; Romin says. His voice is calm and serene, despite everything.
&quot;Time for what?&quot; Jarrett asks.
&quot;It&apos;s time to rush the wall,&quot; he says.
&quot;But that&apos;s suicide!&quot; Jarrett says.
&quot;Not you. There&apos;s a higher mission here than any of us, and even if none of us survive to tell of it...&quot;
I cast a ball of fire at the wall of Essenced explosives. The metal warms, but nothing happens. In response, Romin grasps my shoulder.
&quot;It&apos;s been an honor to be your friend, Titus. I truly love you as a brother.&quot;
&quot;You can&apos;t do this,&quot; I tell him. &quot;We can find another way. Let me try again!&quot;
&quot;We both know there&apos;s no time to think,&quot; he says. Something feels so different in him: no longer the same child paralyzed by hubris; no longer shivering in the shadow of that great, bronze statue.
Valentina embraces him as another soldier takes her spot. She weeps into his chest for seconds until she&apos;s dragged back into the fight, because Endogeny is a thoughtless hivemind with no patience for altruism.
&quot;Remember what I stood for,&quot; he tells us, letting out his raucous rallying cry as he charges the wall with the detonator. Endogeny binds itself together at his egress right before it can grab him, and as we continue to resist the black bile with tears wetting our eyes, the blast eviscerates the wall, casting chunks of pearlescent white stone, blowing a massive, searing hole though the layer Endogeny unintentionally guarded us with.
The plumes and smoke blow over. We cough at the white dust as Endogeny retreats, afraid of the Essenced flames scalding the ground. To the distant foothills, we can already see other massive chunks of the amorphous mass advancing into the city, gaining size with the plant life it rips from the ground: absorbing whole trees in a matter of seconds.
But through the smoke and dust, light shimmers through the vertical crater that Romin&apos;s sacrifice offers us. There is nothing left of him to mourn like all the times past, and in the shortness of time, our ears ringing as our lungs scorch on sparse air, we realize the only piece of him we have left to carry is the purpose that bonded the warring factions together.
&quot;I loved him. I should have told him, Gods above, even at the end I couldn&apos;t say it.&quot; Valentina repeats it over and over. The insurgents rush into the vertical crater as we stand there in disbelief.
This is the first time the finality of this chance has imbued me with the weight of grief. My mind flickers to that small breadth of time separating me from Romin when he wasn&apos;t reduced to a bloody mist, relegated to nothing as if he never existed at all. I fall to my knees. I know if I went back that maybe, just maybe, we could make it work. I could move the line. we could blow it early. Gods above, we could do it all different!
I find the tears rolling down my face when I take Romin&apos;s axegun to my chin, just to feel it when everyone else is too preoccupied with their grief. Maybe Valentina was right to ask. I didn&apos;t feel the weight of personal connection &mdash; all the years that she and her sister feuded over title and family just to apologize later, maybe galvanizing their relationship with that continued strain.
&quot;I can go back still. Just once,&quot; I whisper to myself. This is different than Ullrich&apos;s endless campaign for perfection. This is just a subtle, calculable detail in the vastness of the universe, one small wish to grant. And all it takes is one spasm of a finger.
It&apos;s then that I feel the arms around me as I weep, the barrel under my chin ready to blow my brain out the top in misted confetti, though I wouldn&apos;t be around to feel its power. They tighten themselves around me. They place their head above mine, right into the path of the last loaded slug.
&quot;You have to believe this world can be enough,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;You told me this was it. You can be better than him.&quot;
&quot;He&apos;s right there,&quot; I tell her. &quot;One minute. One minute away from us...&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; she says. Her embrace reminds me of my sister&apos;s gentle compassion in the other worldline. It reminds me of every emotional piece of the promise I made to her, to live smart, hard, and only once more. I check my wrist. Unlike Ullrich, this thread still has its frayed end. &quot;This is all just the truth you told me, moments before you left. So wear his mission on your sleeve.&quot;
Though Valentina&apos;s grief paralyzes her, I goad her onwards towards the opening in the wall, along with Jarrett, Isla, and Delvin, both our fireteams missing an essential member. We let the current of combatants take us once we find the strength to let go, bidding the final farewell to our boisterous friend, without a physical form to bury."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Losing My Perfection","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Thirteen","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Fifty-Four","ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":13,"ChapterFull":54,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":172,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"167","Synopsis":"Titus takes ownership for a world he was only reborn into.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"5.54","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"

In the upper lands, there&apos;s too much anger for looting. Arsonists take nothing and burn everything. If they have Essence, they incinerate the fabric and wood with their palms. For the rest with no power, they light matches, smash windows, and tear the decorative flags and landmarks to the ground.
We&apos;re running to the only place that Ullrich and the Heiress can escape to. We pass outwallers bashing brazen statues with sledgehammers. The unluckiest desperate denizens of the Afterlife are lynched in the streets, hung from trees, swinging in their bright colors as they&apos;re beaten with sticks, but all I can think of is Romin, and what my reaction means. If I can&apos;t shoulder the burden of a sacrifice that wasn&apos;t my fault, I&apos;ll never be able to do what&apos;s awaited me all this time.
The Royal Guard attempt to hold a line against us, but all they do is backpedal. The city was never designed for defense: the only weapon they have is their Essence and their skill with it, but when their adversary&apos;s lust for blood is this strong, the fear of death is meaningless.
I wonder when I should do it. My fingers grasp the frayed end of the thread, and I try to imagine what it will feel like to tear this divine curse from my flesh. I don&apos;t want to imagine how much my friends will suffer when I do it. Maybe deep down, I thought this was all an unreachable goal I&apos;d die short of. Maybe I&apos;d loop forever. Maybe I&apos;d get used to the same span of days, over and over, but when the dream is only moments away, the hesitation is so strong.
&quot;There&apos;s so few of them. It&apos;s like they just disappeared,&quot; Valentina says.
&quot;You said you&apos;ve been here before. Where did they go, Titus?&quot; Jarrett asks.
I follow the same route I took when they shepherded me with the guards. None of these outwallers know where they&apos;re really hiding, because they&apos;d never expect to ever be above them.
&quot;Below us,&quot; I tell them.
&quot;What,&quot; Isla says, &quot;as in, back to the city?&quot;
&quot;Below the ground. In the hollow, lush caves carved by Humans and Chymaera long before us,&quot; I tell them.
&quot;But how do we get there?&quot;
&quot;We have to&mdash;&quot;
A shockwave pulses dirt into the air before I can finish. We&apos;re standing right across from the grate that took me to the depths. 
&quot;What was that?&quot;
We look around. A loud sound in the distance repeats like rushing water. Something changed in the span of several seconds, but I just can&apos;t put my finger on it. The air is so quiet, and I can hear shouts, and for a minute, I wonder if Endogeny has liquidated its victims early.
But I look around. The other insurgents still rushi the central nexus that spawned Endogeny, just past the treeline and the garden wall, where...
&quot;What is that over there? Snow?&quot;
The ground trembles harder. It must be a fog, obscuring the view of all the taller buildings near the center of the peaks.
But then the furthest trees begin to disappear, too. It&apos;s only when the hardy buildings beside us crack and crumble that I realize what is happening.
The others already have a head start. I never expected Isla&apos;s short legs to carry her so fast. Valentina tries again to draw on the powers within her, maybe just enough, and as time slows for them, I pray to the Gods they have the chance to make it.
I&apos;m too far from their pocket of influence to feel the effects. Time accelerates. The ground melts from stone to gravel to sand. This is it. I reach for the thread to pull whatever fleeting moment of power it can give me, clutching the remnants of Pure Essence to activate the birthright that was taken. But it&apos;s too late.
I slip. My feet catch nothing, and soon I&apos;m weightless, falling headlong into the void of ash and dust, but I&apos;m not alone.
Sylvia clutches to me. She tears the celestial pebble of Pure Essence from my neck and allows it to flood her divine circuits with the powers of the Goddess. Her hair glows white. I feel her shielding me with her body as she takes on a hundredth of that divine form, growing until I can barely fill her arms, still tucked around me with such radiant warmth it feels I&apos;ve skipped the hard landing and made it straight to the true afterlife.
She&apos;s pelted with the falling debris, still holding me so tightly as ambient daylight diffuses through the clouds of dust. My head is below her chin, yet my feet can barely reach her waist. 
We hit the bottom. I spring against her breastbone as cascading rock catches up with us. I can feel her wince at the impacts, though she still refuses to raise a hand or an arm.
The amulet&apos;s Essence is waning.
&quot;Please, Sylvia, don&apos;t lose yourself this time,&quot; I beg her. If that side of her permeates, all of this struggle could be for naught.
&quot;I won&apos;t. I just want to save the one I love.&quot;
We brace for the impact, but nothing can prepare us for when we stop falling with the rubble. I hear something pop when I spring against her breastbone. She tries so hard to protect me, hugging me tighter to her chest as the rubble pelts the two of us, and every blow she takes to her legs or side only dampens it the slightest bit.
Somewhere above, a house teetering on the edge gives in to the strain and crumbles half of itself off the shale. Sylvia begins to let up her grasp when it stops hailing, but she&apos;s too slow to react when the solid roof collides with her arm, shattering it. The last I feel is the glancing crumb that bashes into the back of my head, leaving us both limply sprawling across the pit.

I wake to breathless, wailing groans of the dying beneath the rubble. Somewhere a little deeper, the Afterlife is entombed by the ruins of their own city, along with all their decorative adornments, buried with their golden age.
Sylvia lays beside me in her human form, exhausted of Essence, barely able to breathe as she cradled her arm. The dust burns our eyes. I cover Sylvia&apos;s mouth with a tattered piece of fabric before I cover mine, looking up hundreds of feet to try and discern the distant edge, but the dust is too thick. We&apos;re trapped in the hollowed ribcage of the centermost peak, excised of its heart and all its entrails. I know there&apos;s only one person that could eviscerate everything without consequence, and as I lift myself to my feet, healed by Sylvia&apos;s divine Essence in those hours we laid unconscious at the furthest depths, I carry her.
This is the last cycle of the endless tirade between my estranged father and I. If I remember nothing of Ullrich&apos;s resets &mdash; and I refuse to live anything but this linear path from life to certain death in one shot &mdash; the final fated outcome is the only option that can rise from this.
Maybe he&apos;s reset a hundred times. Maybe this is the ultimate impasse he speaks of, and he knows everything, but with my final decision and determination to keep this life the way it plays out, his greatest strength is now his fatal flaw.
I take her towards where the capitol was. We find several caves in the sidewall of the great sinkhole, and head down the closest one, hoping they&apos;re all connected. If I try picking at random, it won&apos;t matter. Ullrich can&apos;t die because of the endless determinism of these cycles. I&apos;m certain he&apos;s seen everything, and I feel his presence reel me forward in time from a different invisible tether: fate.
My eyes adjust to the darkness after I carry her inside. We hear the sound of wet squishing like stepping on saturated sod, and we realize the great Chymaeran weapon feasted between the cracks on the dying denizens of both sides.
My arms are tired. I limp with her in my arms, my clothes completely tattered and worn, showing through to smooth skin healed of its cuts, though the inside strains on sprains and possible shatters.
&quot;Son,&quot; a voice calls. &quot;Son, please save me,&quot; the voice says. Clint approaches me. &quot;The tar, it consumed everything!&quot;
&quot;It left nothing for us. We could have had a chance at the end, after all this time, to be a family again,&quot; Moira says, crying streams of tar down her face from her blackened eyes. &quot;We can have that. We can still have that!&quot;
&quot;You chose my sister and left me to die,&quot; Vera says.
&quot;Only for me to suffer the same fate,&quot; Valentina says, &quot;along with everyone! But you can still save us!&quot;
&quot;I never wanted to die. I wanted to live a full life with my cherished friend,&quot; Romin cries. &quot;I wanted to fall in love with Valentina. Every moment you live tears me further from that dream!&quot;
&quot;You have to die, Titus,&quot; my mother says. &quot;It&apos;s the only way. This is a dead end, and you&apos;ll leave this world with nothing!&quot;
There&apos;s not enough tar for them to grow legs. They slosh along the floor as spectral snakes. But only one is fully formed, and he approaches in full color.
&quot;Tie-bo,&quot; he says, shambling toward me. The amethyst floods his veins in spiderwebs just like the last time I saw him, when I was so young and afraid, so uncomfortable that I left before Clint could offer the last words to his father. Endogeny must have already made it to the graveyards. He was buried near the middle of the wide outer ring of Lower Blackwater.
I&apos;m not sure how much this projection remembers. All the others approach us from behind, urging Sylvia and I to approach him.
&quot;A life of regret was all that was left for me, when I hid in that room. But it seems my map took you to that petty thing I traded for my niece and nephew&apos;s life.&quot;
He sees the amulet around my neck, deterring the other endogenous phantoms of the living dead.
Everett continues. &quot;Then you saw the result of it. You know . . . what happened, you were too young, for me, to explain, or . . . &quot;
He struggles for the words. I only have time for a single question.
&quot;The vials of my blood beneath your trade house. The daughter Clint never should have been able to have. The death of my mother &mdash; why did you do it?&quot;
&quot;Because, patience, couldn&apos;t hold my anger. And when I found out, in the end, that he staged it all...&quot;
&quot;What? What do you mean?&quot; I ask. He&apos;d fall apart if I dropped Sylvia and grabbed him with my hands.
&quot;He was with the Afterlife, long before, that fateful night. Not believing he had it, in him, is the regret I carry with me, even through death.&quot;
&quot;But why, Everett? Why would he do such a thing?&quot;
&quot;Because I had the threads before you were even born,&quot; Ullrich says. 
He approaches with the estranged sister I never got to save in this timeline. His body is covered even further with the crimson twine. 
He says, &quot;If only you knew how many times I&apos;ve explained this to you, but I have to.&quot;
Gentle Everett springs on an anger I never saw as a child. He turns around and drives a fist against his brother&apos;s face, but his hand splatters like pudding against a stone wall, lobbing off a whole chunk of his arm. 
Ullrich doesn&apos;t flinch.
&quot;As children of the original rulers of Blackwater, Everett and I couldn&apos;t have been more different. I was more proactive. That&apos;s why he&apos;s dead and I&apos;m still here.&quot;
He looks at the tar-bound silhouettes of my friends and family.
&quot;Every time you try, Fletcher, you never save them. Whether endogenous or not, can&apos;t you see they&apos;re all just an illusion? Your sister? Your friends? Your lover? They&apos;re ephemeral, see?&quot;
He slams his hands together. Everett&apos;s head explodes in a column of black bile. The endogenous phantoms dissolve into the spaces between the rocks. It&apos;s just Sylvia, Ullrich and I, standing at the mouth of a great, cavernous room.
I say, &quot;You killed the Afterlife, too. You never cared about a golden age.&quot;
&quot;That&apos;s right. It took me a near hundred tries to climb their ranks, putting together the right strings of words, the right speeches, the right show of old-world Human magic, until I had the path set exactly as I needed it. Your grandfather&mdash; No, uncle, Everett, was right. I planned that strike. You were all supposed to die so you&apos;d stop getting in my way,&quot; he says.
&quot;Of your hunger for boundless power?&quot;
&quot;Of seeing it end the same way, over and over and over!&quot; 
I can see a part of him crack, and catch a glimpse at something sincere and so exhausted on the other side. 
I can feel his white anger. &quot;Power? You really look at all this and think it&apos;s about power? Gods below, Fletcher, do you think you can ever possibly understand what I left behind, what they took from me?&quot;
&quot;All I know is it wasn&apos;t enough,&quot; I tell him. &quot;You should have stayed dead the first time.&quot;
I duck before he punches, and I can feel it, though I don&apos;t remember. 
But he does. 
The breadth of time I&apos;ve spent in this chamber might be longer than all my life. The only weapon I have is the certainty that I won&apos;t ever die to live again. It means I&apos;m headed towards a definite end.
I look back at Sylvia as she stands behind me. So much of this life I wished I could see through to the end &mdash; so many I wanted to save and cherish and love &mdash; but I can feel the sublimity of that purpose calling out to me along with everyone I lost waiting on the other side, beckoning for me to close this loop and play the last note of the grand symphony.
He grabs my wrist before I can tear the thread, stunning me when he punches me in the nose. My thread tangles with his, uprooting just enough fleshed for our Essenced blood to mix &mdash; and when it does, allowing the singularity of our endless paradox to coalesce at a single point, the great cavern floods with the presence of every past and future."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"The Last Firebrand","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Fourteen","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Fifty-Five","ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":14,"ChapterFull":55,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":175,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"170","Synopsis":"There is no salvation from failure this time.

A loud snap cracks through the cavern as crimson threads weave themselves into every wall, across the floors, and all atop the ceiling, wriggling like long neon earthworms delving into dirt. 
I dodge before he drives his fist past my head. We strain at the pulse in our circuits when the threads as thick as ropes tighten until they&apos;re tenser than a bowstring, as if pulled by a master archer. They hum with such a deafening frequency that I can&apos;t hear what Ullrich says when he moves his mouth. The resonance pulses the air around the walls. We cover our ears in anguish, unable to fight, brought to our knees until the first thread snaps, and the inertia of time lurches for the both of us.
I fall back in a familiar chair. Before I can open my eyes, the recognition is instant: falling back on the teetering back-left leg until Sylvia shimmed it with one of her scrapped drawings.
That was second year.
My room is just as it was the first day I moved in: not a speck of dust, and I&apos;m frozen there in the doorway with my father helping me lift the bed frame.
I have only seconds to dodge Ullrich when he comes for me. I grab for the cup of pencils on the Academy desk as I dive towards the window, but my hand slips through them, tipping them over as if I&apos;m only made of wind. I stumble to the side and almost fall through the window&mdash; the force is enough to spiderweb the corner in the same place I remembered finding it &mdash; yet I pull myself up to confront Ullrich as he recovers.
&quot;I can give you a better life than this. We can start over. You can have a real father,&quot; he says, swatting the cigarette from Clint&apos;s mouth as his hand passes through his head, coaxing it out my true father&apos;s lips to leave that burn in the carpet.
Made of whatever ethereal presence we&apos;re in, the force between us is real. I manage a blow against his chest with my fist and it staggers him, disappearing behind Age 16 Titus as he ever-so-slowly sets the frame on the floor. But Ullrich surprises me through the solid shape, punching me directly in the head.
I fall to the floor years later in under a second. Dawn freezes in the windowsill, and Sylvia sits at the edge of the bed as I&apos;m turned away from her. Ullrich leaps over the bed and through that Titus&apos; chest as I recoil against the wall, springing forward to get an advantage on him, blasting my knuckles into his jaw as the vision changes again.
We&apos;re in the courtyard of some grand estate, but it&apos;s not the Afterlife. Verdant vines span the walls of a castle older than everything in Blackwater. The world is green as far as my eyes can see. Two dark-haired children smile as they slash at each other with wooden swords, as finely-dressed royalty watch, and I recognize them from the painting.
Ullrich wipes his mouth. The blood is certainly real. &quot;This was a hundred and sixty years before you were born. Nordhaven was our city, our birthright, and it was taken from us!&quot;
&quot;We don&apos;t have the right to change what happens. We&apos;ll never be satisfied if we allow ourselves to suffer forever,&quot; I tell him, but it only angers him further. 
He uppercuts me in the stomach. I land on the kitchen table of my childhood home as the air parts my lungs. The musket blast is blinding, and I watch as the bullet collides with Valentina&apos;s skull all over again, erupting her thoughts across Romin&apos;s face as he recoils and makes his choice to die a martyr.
I roll of the table before Ullrich can use the knife he tried to grasp and dive out the window, passing so quickly through it that it doesn&apos;t have the force to shatter. Bullets fly from the Royal Guard like beads on a thousand strings, inching ever-so-slowly though the consequences of their trajectory are real.
I feel it graze me. White-hot pain sears my arm, and I trip over the steps of the entryway just as the house is set to explode.
My head collides with something fragile and wooden. The snow is cold. It&apos;s a mound of dirt far beyond the walls, and I can instantly recognize the house. Ullrich is standing over me, but he&apos;s far younger, and far more emotionally distraught.
&quot;I buried you here a hundred and twelve times until it broke me,&quot; Ullrich says. His older face pops through his younger one. &quot;This was the first time I lost all of you, one by one, when the extremists that destroyed Nordhaven finished their job on the last of us. We were so weak and defenseless.&quot;
I try to lift myself, but he grabs my clothes by the collar, throwing me against a tree in the wooded glen. Several lonely years flash past my eyes when my head collides with the bark, and I see Ullrich standing at the apex of the roof, ready to end his suffering until Khiras approaches from behind him, joined by a young girl.
&quot;A secret kept from the other Gods. Essenced magic violating the rules of life itself,&quot; he said, &quot;and your Sylvia must have taken that idea from her on one of your trips to the Reservoir.&quot;
Time flashes backwards to a time long before. A pocket of green christens the house with leafy trees. Ullrich stands beside himself. Young Ullrich stands on the porch, smiling, with a woman holding a dark-haired baby: my true mother.
&quot;You&apos;re a cross-blood, Fletcher! You&apos;re a mask of both sides, and you were going to be my legacy,&quot; Ullrich says. &quot;But no matter how hard I tried to save you, you would die at their hands. I hemorrhaged Essence just trying to keep you alive, when every time I returned you knew nothing of what I went through. Have you figured it out yet, that Essence is the only thing we carry from those past lives? So many dead timelines. What does one unforgivable act weigh, in one unfortunate timeline, when it all of it will just disappear?&quot;
We&apos;re in the coliseum beyond time. In one time I drive my sword through the back of Isla. Another time, I stab those cadets over and over and over until their bodies are unrecognizable, and when I lift my ethereal form from that pit where I almost lost my soul, I tell him. &quot;It doesn&apos;t. Those timelines still live, and that price is far more than either one of us can afford.&quot; I try to grab the hilt of that Titus&apos; blade, but he&apos;s far too intent with fury.
And then we reach a place that neither of us can recognize. Maybe it&apos;s a future from a lost time. Or maybe it&apos;s the dreams we wish for so strongly that they materialize.
Ullrich limps towards that beautiful vision. I can feel the heat from the sun on my skin as the trees shimmer with their glistening, jade leaves, and beneath the canopy, Ullrich&apos;s dead wife calls to him with the baby in her arms. In front of me, Clint and Moira are together. Ellie grins from ear-to-ear with the tender smile I thought she&apos;d lost forever. Romin and Valentina are there, too, along with their families, and Sylvia stands in front of me with a wriggling bundle of blankets in her arms.
&quot;We can get here, Fletcher. We can have it!&quot;
I watch as Ellie runs toward me, calling my name, ready to spring for a tender hug so that I can swing her around and plant a kiss on her cheek. But someone else emerges from behind them: a different Ellie, the one I made my promise to, and I remember what she said before my final death.
I can feel the knife still in my belt, and I unsheathe it before she can reach me. I can see the tar left behind by her footsteps, sullying the illusory dirt, and as my hands tighten around the blade I know is there though I can&apos;t see it, I drive one final thrust into the heart of the young girl as she cries out in astonished panic."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":117,"ActNum":5,"ChapterPart":14,"ChapterFull":55,"ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":117,"Index":177,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"172","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Not a good ending here: fix it.

The Heiress grasps her chest where the dagger protrudes from between her ribs. My sister&apos;s hot blood is on my hands. The threads retreat from the walls and I&apos;m back in the cavern as Ullrich grasps longingly for that dying image.
Ellie collapses to the ground, choking on the blood that fills her lungs, but before I can cry for what I&apos;ve done, I viciously rip the thread from my wrist, sealing my fate in this timeline alone.
Incredible power floods my circuits when the amulet finally reacts, absorbed wholly into my body, and when the white-hot flames cover my skin, I charge for Ullrich, tightening my hands around his neck as the Essence drains from his body.
He tries to struggle, but his strength is no match.
&quot;You&apos;ve betrayed your entire race. You decide in the intensity of this moment to accept their sacrifice. But when the intensity is gone and the guilt is all that remains, you will plead to go back. You will rue this choice!&quot;
&quot;Then it will be my life&apos;s duty to bear the weight,&quot; I tell him. &quot;This is truly my last decision.&quot;
The laws of this world straighten themselves in the absence of my thread. I can feel my form crumbling to dead Essence, returning to the place I&apos;ve belonged since the beginning. I only pray she&apos;s waiting for me there on the other side.

His limp body cascades into the pit, still living. I watch as the perfect combination of twelve rocks, lined end-to-end, fall to form an arched platform for him to land on, and he lands hard.
I feel Sylvia grab me from behind as I lose my presence in this life, and she turns me, only to find that she&apos;s dissolving, too.
&quot;We were both never meant to be here,&quot; I tell her. &quot;We&apos;ve both long overstayed our welcome.&quot;
&quot;I enjoyed every second of it with you,&quot; she says, and when I hold her closer, I can feel our Essence coalesce in a single stream. 
The last sensation I feel is our abrasive lips pressing together. Consciousness dissolves into something blank and formless, changing from a person into no more than an idea."},{"DocType":"Act","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":"","AutoNameFull":"ACT VI","ActNum":6,"ChapterPart":"","ChapterFull":"","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Index":178,"Label":"Firebrand","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"173","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"6","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"Perspective":"Titus","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"Epilogue","Body":""}
