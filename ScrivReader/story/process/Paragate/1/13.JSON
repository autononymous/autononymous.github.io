    "<p>&emsp;I can only work as fast as the computer will take me. I&apos;ve spent so many hours between renders imagining how I would boost the performance if IT gave me a blank check and I was then the bottleneck &mdash; although a workstation laptop is nice to take home, it has nothing over one of those stationary rigs that the Robinson-Monroe lifers were grandfathered into.</p><p>&emsp;They gave me the laptop two years ago, and it hasn&apos;t been updated since. One day I booted into BIOS to see if I could overclock it, or take it to its limits. But IT&apos;s Great Wall of Control knows no bounds, so all I can do is sit here for twenty minutes at a time before I notice the changes in the drawing are applied.</p><p>&emsp;Those twenty minutes are silent. Only Wilbur and I sit in the row, and we&apos;re not even across from each other. Reed filled in the spot that the last escapee left behind, and although I was eager for months to move next to Kei and take the next steps, Navesh insisted it was a &quot;major waste of time.&quot; I feel like Wilbur and I have exhausted every topic across the generational gap: his kids, when I plan to marry, if I have a serious girlfriend yet, cars, and sports. Every day I hear his wake apnea over the partitions, and sometimes I wonder if it&apos;s the perfect cover for him to be sleeping.</p><p>&emsp;The computer still holds an hourglass. It&apos;s midday, and the neighboring row is filled with chatter. I hear Reed&apos;s voice the most often, and a little too often: if golden retrievers could design and code, and the connotation didn&apos;t imply he was stupid, I think it would fit him well. Kei acknowledges his musings here and there, but is always so focused that she spits no more than a couple words.</p><p>&emsp;I check the calendar in the lower right corner of my screen. Fall is fast approaching, and when I count, it&apos;s been almost four weeks since I moved in. Four weekends of my parents coming over to visit, bringing over one of my favorite home-cooked meals, allowing them to ask when they&apos;ll have grandkids now that I have a house. Four weeks since I lost my brother&apos;s classic IPod, so now I listen to music on my phone. But also four weeks without drinking: most days I just go home, spend an hour on the computer scrolling my list of games, trying to convince myself to play something, and then go to sleep early unless I go to the gym with Miguel.</p><p>&emsp;Reed keeps rambling on about sports and hobbies, and the more I just sit there &mdash; helpless to walk over or else I&apos;ll look lonely and desperate &mdash; the more I wonder if I&apos;m getting the right dose of meds. The longer time drags, and the later into my twenties it gets, the further I feel from the spurious passion of those college years where it was forced out of me. It&apos;s like being at the bottom of a dark pool, or a distant game of telephone recalling how I last recalled those moments. My vocal cords feel neglected for how little use they get, and like an unmotivated violinist, I&apos;ve been unpracticed for a while.</p><p>&emsp;The render loads. It breaks the entire assembly, and I have another three keystrokes before I wait even longer.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey, Reed. Good job on the redline today,&quot; Nav says. &quot;I hope you&apos;ve been getting used to the software?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; he says. &quot;Kei has been teaching me well. And Cody over there, too.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I count the green-stamped pages on my desk. Three I&apos;ve completed today. Maybe they just forget I work here?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So anyways. I want the three junior engineers to follow me,&quot; Nav says. I duck my head to look busy when he comes over. &quot;Cody, can you follow us?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure, Nav,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;We gather in one of the small meeting rooms. I sit first near the door, then Kei and Reed sit together on the far side. Nav makes small talk when he&apos;s plugging in his laptop. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen you at any of the happy hours, Cody,&quot; he says. &quot;The whole team was there last week: what have you been so busy with?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I even got Kei to go once,&quot; Reed says. &quot;And she&apos;s usually busy all the time!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Kei smiles. &quot;Yeah, I guess I can admit last week was a little fun. Even if it&apos;s just talking about guy stuff at a sports bar.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Reed looks at me earnestly. I can tell that he means it. &quot;You should come.&quot; He reminds me of my business major roommates in college, except before I had a legitimate excuse.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Sounds like fun.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, tonight&apos;s the night. We were thinking Chili&apos;s,&quot; Nav says. &quot;And you all have been doing great, so I thought I&apos;d buy you all a drink.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cheers to that!&quot; Reed exclaims, raising an imaginary glass as I take a long draw of an energy drink. Nav flicks on the projector. His screen comes into focus, with a presentation labeled INTERMITTENT APPRENTICE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, BY NAVESH D. PRATEL.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So I&apos;ve been looking for ways to keep us busy. Things have been rather slow, and with Scott leaving and all &mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Scott&apos;s leaving?&quot; We say in near unison.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Oh, shoot &mdash; I was supposed to wait until Monday, gosh darn it,&quot; he says. &quot;Keep this between us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s going to happen?&quot; Kei asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know, with the hiring freeze and all, maybe something will come from within,&quot; Nav says. He winks so hard I think I hear it. &quot;Anyways, on an unrelated note, I have a project to keep you guys busy, instead of vanishing early to go to Starbucks.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Awesome,&quot; Reed says, but literally.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We spend forever just designing and redesigning what already exists. It&apos;s what most of engineering is if you&apos;re not R and D, after all.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Next slide.</p><p>&emsp;A 90&apos;s clip-art image of batteries is on the screen, each with little faces, shaking hands like little powered businessmen. I nearly laugh and I have to cover my mouth.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You spend so much time doing redlines as support engineers that you don&apos;t get to feel what it&apos;s like to come up with something. Surely you felt it in college. Maybe you&apos;ve missed it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I nod almost as excitedly as Reed does.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Enclosures, and more enclosures. Modifying dimensions of existing batteries by the smallest hair to please a customer&apos;s plans. Well, I want you all to take a shot at designing something entirely new,&quot; Nav says. &quot;You should know how batteries work from experience, not just designing the stuff they&apos;re housed in.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, a million times yes,&quot; Reed says, and even Kei looks slightly invested.</p><p>&emsp;The next slide is a cross-section of a battery scanned from one of the lifers&apos; textbooks, with such hand-drawn beauty there&apos;s no doubt it came from the seventies. I relish that it&apos;s finally something I&apos;m good at, involving all the robotics I love to do in my garage.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What happens is a redox reaction, or reduction-oxidation,&quot; Nav says, sounding like my Circuits professor if he was twenty years older. &quot;The anode has electron-rich elements like zinc, so it&apos;s negative. The cathode has elements like silver, so it&apos;s positive, and when you connect a wire from one to the other, you get electron flow.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Next slide.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We typically do nickel-cadmium or lithium-ion, far better than the lead-acid ones. Then there&apos;s nickel-metal-hydride . . .&quot; </p><p>&emsp;He drones on and on. With the energy drink death-gripped in my hand, I manage to stay awake: Reed can do it without anything. I decide to just wait for the email with the PowerPoint.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And, with all these considerations, your task will be to design an optimal battery, given a set volume. You&apos;ll do some theory, then we&apos;ll use the multimillion-dollar battery lab the R&D guys seem to have forgotten about.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s great,&quot; Reed says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How far you go with this project is up to you, and what you take from it is very important. You&apos;ll be doing this between redlines, getting feedback from Senior engineers, so that you design the best battery possible, and safely,&quot; he says, closing his laptop. &quot;We&apos;ll be starting next week. And since it&apos;s Friday, maybe we can talk about it at Happy Hour.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We all stand from the table. My foot falls asleep pretzeled on my other leg, so I stumble towards the door last. But before I can exit, Reed stops me.</p>",
    "<p>&emsp;&quot;Hey bro. I was thinking we could talk about the project later,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;What is this, an undergrad lab? Is there a grade?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, that&apos;d be cool,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s your phone number? I already got Kei&apos;s last week. I was thinking we could make a group chat,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh, yeah, man, sure.&quot; I take his phone. I enter CODY WORK in the top, and the ten digits in the box. He shoots me a text of the first three emojis in his &quot;recent&quot; bar, and then proceeds to make the group message right then and there.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cool!&quot; He says. &quot;I was thinking, you look like you lift. Would you be down to lift before Monday?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I hardly even get in the door on time, dude, I want to tell him, but I&apos;m short on friends and his energy is nostalgic for friends in a time long past. &quot;Sure, I would like that,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Great! I&apos;ll send you the one I go to. You can use my membership,&quot; he insists.</p><p>&emsp;I nod my head, still in my cooldown period for using &quot;cool,&quot; &quot;great,&quot; or &quot;dope.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The rest of the day passes slowly. I draw a couple concepts for the enclosure on sheets of TOPS engineering paper, an empty pad from never designing anything new. The late hour comes, and when the others begin to make their egress, it&apos;s just Kei and I.</p><p>&emsp;After shutting down. I pass her while she&apos;s deep in a design project. I&apos;m surprised she notices.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Quite the eager guy, isn&apos;t he,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Who, Reed?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot; She laughs. &quot;Reminds me of you when you started here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, you mean before my soul got sucked from my body?&quot; I approach her, pulling down my eyelids and rolling my eyes to expose the bloodshot whites. &quot;Can you see it in there? Is it still alive?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She draws close to take a glance, and I catch a smell of familiar perfume from a date long forgotten. &quot;Just enough, I think.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I say, &quot;I don&apos;t have energy like he does. That&apos;s for sure. And . . . it&apos;s lonely over there. Wilbur just snores all day, unless he&apos;s bashing his keyboard and cursing at the new software.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, then maybe I could make up for it,&quot; she says. But she&apos;s still focused on her drawing.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I mean we could hang out sometime. Like, outside of work,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;My mind struggles to think of something platonic. &quot;Oh. Like what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know. The kind of stuff we used to do. But before, before...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Before that last summer before you left, I think. That was just Student Government stuff late in the evenings. Late work like this. I remember the last day of my junior year and her senior year, cleaning the room one last time as the Presidential cabinet, when I felt my heart swell in my chest with the apprehension of whether I was going to make my move. Time was running out. I had waited all year. The door was closed, and when she turned around, I pressed my lips to hers, and she dissolved into me, starting that perfect summer before she went&mdash;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody? I said we could do dinner.&quot; I was staring at her lips the whole time. It&apos;s a miracle I didn&apos;t raise half a chub, thanks to the waistband trick.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, that sounds great. I&apos;ve got a couple Chuck E Cheese coupons I&apos;ve been clipping out of the gazette.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What the fuck?&quot; She laughs, something I haven&apos;t heard in a while. &quot;See, this is the part of you I miss. There&apos;s surely still a soul in there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I hope so,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll shoot you a text,&quot; she offers, just as Reed sends another message in our group chat. All I can think of is how we left it last: letting the chance of starting anew decay over four years of college. It never had a title, but the split was worse than any other relationship I&apos;ve been in.</p><p>&emsp;My mind is abuzz on the car ride home, so distracted the dark dissolves my sight of the exit gate, and I nearly ram it. I should be happy, but I feel some kind of sadness overtake me, and by the third light, I can feel my eyes well with tears. Maybe it&apos;s how fast the four weeks since moving in have gone. Maybe it&apos;s this unstructured emptiness into which my life retreats. Like Newton said about forces and stuff in motion, I feel like if nothing else ever acted on me, I&apos;d float in this job at this level and at this social vapidness until I hit the mahogany wood of my coffin.</p><p>&emsp;I don&apos;t know how Reed or my late brother Jackie seem to find it. That energy to reach beyond, and every time I reach the end of this line of thinking, I wish it was the one lesson my older brother could have passed down to me.</p>",
    "<p>&emsp;I toss my keys on the counter: the house is a moderate mess when my parents aren&apos;t coming the day after. I slip my hand down my pants and grab the TV remote (not for porn), fixing the sweaty adhesion I&apos;d dealt with since the afternoon.</p><p>&emsp;Reed messages about the happy hour in the involuntary group chat. He reminds me of my brother. And, surprisingly, Kei says she&apos;s going, too.</p><p>&emsp;They ask me if I&apos;m coming, but the darkness of the foyer is too comfortable. All I want is to do nothing, so the minutes pass until the hour passes and I still haven&apos;t responded, just sitting there, wondering why I don&apos;t feel much of anything.</p><p>&emsp;Before long I&apos;m lost in dreamless sleep, and the next moment, I awake in my boxers to a loud disturbance next door. The oven clock reads 2:17 AM. There&apos;s a loud banging on the door. It&apos;s that strange adjoining door, connecting my flat with my neighbor&apos;s. Beyond the odd noises from the adjoining townhouse, I haven&apos;t touched the over engineered doorstop since.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Help me, please,&quot; the voice pleads, in an accent or a dialect I can hardly understand.</p><p>&emsp;I stumble through blackness for the door.</p>&quot;Cody,&quot; she sobs."

      "<p id=\"1.13.2.6\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Cool!&quot; He says. &quot;I was thinking, you look like you lift. Would you be down to lift before Monday?&quot;</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.7\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I hardly even get in the door on time, dude, I want to tell him, but I&apos;m short on friends and his energy is nostalgic for friends in a time long past. &quot;Sure, I would like that,&quot; I tell him.</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.8\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Great! I&apos;ll send you the one I go to. You can use my membership,&quot; he insists.</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.9\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I nod my head, still in my cooldown period for using &quot;cool,&quot; &quot;great,&quot; or &quot;dope.&quot;</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.10\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;The rest of the day passes slowly. I draw a couple concepts for the enclosure on sheets of TOPS engineering paper, an empty pad from never designing anything new. The late hour comes, and when the others begin to make their egress, it&apos;s just Kei and I.</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.11\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;After shutting down. I pass her while she&apos;s deep in a design project. I&apos;m surprised she notices.</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.12\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Quite the eager guy, isn&apos;t he,&quot; she says.</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.13\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Who, Reed?&quot;</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.14\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot; She laughs. &quot;Reminds me of you when you started here.&quot;</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.15\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Oh, you mean before my soul got sucked from my body?&quot; I approach her, pulling down my eyelids and rolling my eyes to expose the bloodshot whites. &quot;Can you see it in there? Is it still alive?&quot;</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.16\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;She draws close to take a glance, and I catch a smell of familiar perfume from a date long forgotten. &quot;Just enough, I think.&quot;</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.17\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I say, &quot;I don&apos;t have energy like he does. That&apos;s for sure. And . . . it&apos;s lonely over there. Wilbur just snores all day, unless he&apos;s bashing his keyboard and cursing at the new software.&quot;</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.18\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Well, then maybe I could make up for it,&quot; she says. But she&apos;s still focused on her drawing.</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.19\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.20\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I mean we could hang out sometime. Like, outside of work,&quot; she says.</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.21\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My mind struggles to think of something platonic. &quot;Oh. Like what?&quot;</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.22\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know. The kind of stuff we used to do. But before, before...&quot;</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.23\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;Before that last summer before you left, I think. That was just Student Government stuff late in the evenings. Late work like this. I remember the last day of my junior year and her senior year, cleaning the room one last time as the Presidential cabinet, when I felt my heart swell in my chest with the apprehension of whether I was going to make my move. Time was running out. I had waited all year. The door was closed, and when she turned around, I pressed my lips to hers, and she dissolved into me, starting that perfect summer before she went&mdash;</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.24\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Cody? I said we could do dinner.&quot; I was staring at her lips the whole time. It&apos;s a miracle I didn&apos;t raise half a chub, thanks to the waistband trick.</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.25\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;Yeah, that sounds great. I&apos;ve got a couple Chuck E Cheese coupons I&apos;ve been clipping out of the gazette.&quot;</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.26\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;What the fuck?&quot; She laughs, something I haven&apos;t heard in a while. &quot;See, this is the part of you I miss. There&apos;s surely still a soul in there.&quot;</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.27\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I hope so,&quot; I say.</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.28\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll shoot you a text,&quot; she offers, just as Reed sends another message in our group chat. All I can think of is how we left it last: letting the chance of starting anew decay over four years of college. It never had a title, but the split was worse than any other relationship I&apos;ve been in.</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.29\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;My mind is abuzz on the car ride home, so distracted the dark dissolves my sight of the exit gate, and I nearly ram it. I should be happy, but I feel some kind of sadness overtake me, and by the third light, I can feel my eyes well with tears. Maybe it&apos;s how fast the four weeks since moving in have gone. Maybe it&apos;s this unstructured emptiness into which my life retreats. Like Newton said about forces and stuff in motion, I feel like if nothing else ever acted on me, I&apos;d float in this job at this level and at this social vapidness until I hit the mahogany wood of my coffin.</p>",
      "<p id=\"1.13.2.30\" class=\"Cody\">&emsp;I don&apos;t know how Reed or my late brother Jackie seem to find it. That energy to reach beyond, and every time I reach the end of this line of thinking, I wish it was the one lesson my older brother could have passed down to me.</p>"

There&apos;s a loud banging on the door. It&apos;s that strange adjoining door, connecting my flat with my neighbor&apos;s. Beyond the odd noises from the adjoining townhouse, I haven&apos;t touched the over engineered doorstop since.</p>",
