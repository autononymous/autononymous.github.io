            "In the long, dragging years after college, all I could ever ask is to waste my life as efficiently as possible. ",
            "It&apos;s like how I&apos;m told falling in love is supposed to be: I can&apos;t pinpoint when the feeling began, only the realization that I was stuck in it, wading through a long, dark tunnel in the passageways of my mind, praying that the distant light approaching wasn&apos;t that of another train. Maybe it was the twenty-sixth hour awake at two o&apos;clock in the library, on that Sunday before finals, when a study partner scrolling Facebook reminded me that it was my birthday. Maybe it was turning down Kei when she asked me to go out to celebrate my twenty-first, preferring the cold basement of the fraternity house when I knew everybody else would be away. Maybe it was that I felt more satisfied shelving the senior project I named after my late brother than all the accolades and attention that came after it.",
            "Maybe it was the speech my father gave at my graduation party, splurging on his male allowance of tears, saying how excited he was to work alongside me at the aerospace company. How I didn&apos;t laugh when he said my engineering drawings would have to be worthy of his tools. And how I realized I felt absolutely nothing.",
            "But it&apos;s been two-and-a-half years since I returned to my hometown in Colorado. I reached the summit of my Bachelors&apos; degree with too much exhaustion to take in the view, and in the two-year descent on expired passions that once got me to the top, I can&apos;t think of anything exceptional that&apos;s happened since.",
            "Not counting today, that is.",
            "The thought comes to me a lot in periods of idle silence. As I sit in my new townhome, celebrating the wake of another great milestone, all I hear is the white noise of my best friend snoring in sudden stops and starts on my futon, using one of the broken cardboard moving boxes as a bedsheet, rattling the mess of empty beer cans as he fights a losing battle for comfort.",
            "It takes a moment to lift myself from the flimsy folding chair. I fight the spinning world, stumbling towards the kitchen counter to grab the remote. ",
            "Freaky Friday",
            " autoplays on some free streaming service since I was too lazy to enter the family account. I reach to turn off the wall TV that&apos;s angled on the floor, but I hesitate &mdash; finding that I enjoy the faint sound of it over the silence.",
            "I smile. ",
            "It feels nice to have my friend here,",
            " I think.",
            "The tears still wet my face, mostly from the laughter of digging up past memories, and reconnecting with a cherished childhood friend. I lift my old lacrosse stick from the ground to use it as a cane, digging my fingers into the mesh of the basket, deciding to fetch a glass of water to mitigate tomorrow&apos;s long hangover headache. But then an odd chill convects the wetness of my skin. ",
            "I hear my parents&apos; lecture from an hour earlier &mdash; a long diatribe on how much I wasted their heating bill by keeping my windows cracked in the winter, trying to resist my mother&apos;s menopausal &quot;cold flashes&quot;. But this is ",

            "I press my hand to the window screen. The window is open, but the breeze funnels out instead of in. And when I close the window, I feel my ears pop from the rising pressure. ",
            "I remember my first thermo class: ",
            "isn&apos;t hot supposed to run to cold?",
            "So I search for the source, thinking I found my first item for the punch list. The air is dry, and when I stumble towards the source of the gusting winds &mdash; the small closet beneath the stairs &mdash; a faint, flickering light glows in the space beneath the door.",
            "An empty can crunches when I step on it, and I realize I&apos;m still wearing my steel-toed shoes, along with the rest of my casual work clothes. The lacrosse stick braces me as I stumble forwards&mdash;feeling like my uncle does on Ambien when he doesn&apos;t fall asleep in time&mdash;until my hand touches the freezing handle.",
            "Tumultuous winds scream beneath the door and through the cracks, bashing the fitting against the lock. My mind doesn&apos;t work well when it&apos;s crossed, but I find myself fixated on how strange the closet door looks. I never noticed the handle, etched with an intricacy so far outside the palate of the builders&apos; package. ",
            "Surely Mom or Dad would have noticed it on any one of the tours, right?",
            "I turn the knob far enough that the bolt no longer withholds the gale, and I lose all my control. ",
            "The wooden door buffets me in the face. Stars flash in my vision, and if it weren&apos;t for the lacrosse stick, I would have slammed my head on the granite counter. Instead, I find myself slumped beneath the bartop, barricaded by two metal stools.",
            "I&apos;m speechless until the rooms equalize in pressure, rubbing out the ache in my forehead. I lift my eyes. No longer does the closet greet me, but the light of a whole other townhouse on the opposing side.",
            "Unable to fathom whether this dream is just the imaginings of an inebriated mind, I lift myself from the floor and stumble through the threshold of the archway. The contours of the floor change from that of smooth, buffered wood to sanded planks and stone. On the other side is another thick wooden door with the same handle, thrown all the way open. I wonder if my neighbors are so old that they insist on the technology of the last century. Who would spend the money to furnish their townhome this way, with walls and decor so aged my great-grandmother would feel at home?",
            "It feels so wrong to be here, but I&apos;m a social drunk, and this is a chance to make friends.",
            "&quot;Hello? You forgot to lock your door. Sorry to intrude &mdash; I&apos;m the neighbor from the unit on the other side. My name is Cody, Cody Dunsmore,&quot; I say, and so I continue, stammering my words to ensure my presence isn&apos;t a surprise, though with cast iron kettles and candles, I doubt these fogies would be agile enough to swing anything at their friendly intruder.",
            "I find a knight&apos;s uniform on the table, tailored to a woman&apos;s measurements, along with realistic metal boots.",
            "&quot;The old bat must be into costume play. Whatever gets you off,&quot; I mutter, but then I see the biggest surprise leaning against the wall. I try to take it in my hands, but it&apos;s so damn heavy: nothing like the weapons those mall ninjas buy at conventions.",
            "I drop the lacrosse stick to try to lift it. Surely it&apos;s one of those real-looking swords the neckbeards buy, right?",
            "Nope.",
            "&quot;Christ almighty!&quot; I exclaim.",
            "I try to steady it the same way I saw in the movies, but it kills my wrists. I wonder how many exercises these geriatric fantasy fetishists have to do to hold a sword like this, like holding a barbell by its end.",
            "I put it back against the wall, and I decide to try speaking again. ",
            "&quot;Hello? You left your door open.&quot; ",
            "The house smells too musty to be a new build, like it&apos;s seen generations of families through its halls. Spiderwebs collect in the corners of the cabinets. The crimson curtains are bleached from decades of continuous sunlight. And when I fumble for a light switch on the walls, I find nothing: nor a single cord in this simple home snaked across the surface.",
            "The space is dead silent in the absence of appliances: so silent that I can hear the heartbeat in my ears. Maybe I should return home to try again tomorrow. ",
            "But my plan is cut short when a shadow slides behind the front marbled glass. I haven&apos;t the time to react when the door blasts open, screeching on rusted hinges. The intruder closes the distance before I have a chance to react, blasting their glowing palm against my shoulder, casting me over their dining table with a whole handprint burned into my beer-stained work shirt.",
            "The female knight is quick to pin me against the floor, straddling me with her bare thighs. My mind races to explain. I can only consider she&apos;s an influencer, or one of those intensely dedicated cosplayers I found LARPing on campus. Her speech is incoherent &mdash; but the longer she berates me in her mother language, drawing the prop knife against my neck as I struggle under her inhuman strength, a strange comprehension of her words overtakes me.",
            "I feel the sentiment behind her panic. I thought she was just speaking in tongues, but I can feel my mind strain as it arranges itself to piece together the meaning of the words. And when the headache passes, I realize that I can understand her fully.",
            "Her eyes are a golden hazel from colored contacts, and I see both of them when she looks down at me, although she covers her convincingly-scarred right eye with bangs. ",
            "She&apos;s dressed like one of those hobbyists at the Shaleborough Renaissance Faire. Her blond, silken braid hangs forward from her shoulder as she leans over me, making her look more like an angry princess than a defensive knight.",
            "&quot;Chill out,&quot; I say, slurring my words. &quot;I&apos;m your neighbor!&quot;",
            "But I find the panic in her face to be even greater than mine. She rocks on my torso with every shallow breath, expertly resisting every ounce of strength I have to fight, and I feel the coolness of her cosplay armor chill the heat of my flesh as she pins my arms with her gauntlets. ",
            "&quot;You aren&apos;t going anywhere,&quot; she tells me, tightening her grasp on my wrists. Her warm breath is on my neck as she tries to steady the prop knife, and she almost seems intimidated by my drunken composure. But it&apos;s the sudden rise in emotion that ignites something I&apos;m even more afraid of &mdash; and I try to make it known to her. ",
            "&quot;I think you should get off me, I&mdash;I can&apos;t control it,&quot; I say, but she&apos;s clueless about what she does to me, straddling my waist with her strong, bare thighs, the pulse of my heart quickly transitioning to my waist.",
            "&quot;You control nothing, thief!&quot;",
            "My arms are pinned beneath her legs. The pressure pounds in my skull. There&apos;s no chance to try the waistband trick, and there&apos;s only one place that all the blood can go.",
            "&quot;You&apos;re a fool to break into the military district. I&apos;m a knight of the Royal Guard,&quot; she declares, as the edge of the prop knife digs into my neck. ",
            "&quot;I don&apos;t think you understand. I can&apos;t control what&apos;s going to happen,&quot; I say, squirming with all I have.",
            "&quot;You pathetic weakling, what could you possibly do now?&quot; ",
            "She has the upper hand. And all I have is a single word I learned on the Internet.",

            "Her face flushes in mere seconds. I struggle beneath her as she tensions the knife against my neck, and when I feel the edge scratch the stubble beneath my chin, the cold steel drawing the heat from my neck, I realize it&apos;s real enough to draw something else.",

            "She quickly retreats, her piercing, yellow eyes assessing me with stronger eye contact than I had at my first job interview.",
            "I lack the mental capacity to decide whether to laugh or scream. &quot;I swear, I didn&apos;t break in here,&quot; I say, still embarassed as I cover my erection with my hands, hoping her e-girl stardom has dumbed her down enough to lack object permanence. I gesture to the closet. &quot;The door was open. I just walked in.&quot;",

            "&quot;You&apos;re excited, not confused!&quot; She points the dagger between my legs. &quot;You don&apos;t have the right to be confused right now.&quot; She rambles on like I actually came in to assault her. With the mental capacity for only one emotion, I settle for anger, furious about the hand I&apos;ve been dealt in moving next to this crazy bitch.",

Maybe one of my eyes still wanders over her toned body and the musculature of her core &mdash; or maybe it&apos;s just because I&apos;m so crossed on Miguel&apos;s mini-Mason-Jar mass of Mary Jane that my eyes are still crossing, too.",

            "Her bloodthirsty lack of hesitation to dice my palm? She has to be ex-military, but looks as if she&apos;s the same age as I am. Her outfit looks too perfect to be fake, unless she&apos;s financed it with thousands of dollars. And all the intricacies of her scars and strong, slender body look like too much of an effort to maintain unless fighting was her only job.",

The only thought on my inebriated mind are the words of my late father. And even if his last words were delivered as a whisper, they&apos;re far louder than the raucous trainees crowding Gaffe&apos;s End Tavern. ",
            "He said that I would never find peace in shouldering the weight of all the world. He said it wasn&apos;t because I was weak, or that I was naive &mdash; or that I wasn&apos;t aware of all the reasons we had to be afraid. He said it was because those feelings were wasting my life. ",
            "And then he died the next day in his sleep: burned alive with his youngest progeny that lacked the strength to fight back.",
            "My father made the same mistake that all the other villagers make, thinking that suffering is only caused by change. They think the discomfort in their everyday lives is just an affect of higher forces &mdash; whether by the whims of the Gods or the everlasting hunger of our war. They assume the rare breadths of stillness are caused by a break in the action: that war and its wreckage are just the affects of an empire&apos;s ambition; that all the fighting is only driven by greed.",
            "That if we stopped fighting, no one would have to die.",
            "They fall to that temptation to live the lie, to say it so long and loud that they think their words can incarnate it. Gods know it&apos;s as effective as sleeping beneath barricades of bedsheets to ward off the Chymaera, hiding as the East shakes the ground with its ravenous hunger.",
            "But they&apos;re wrong. They have no idea of how much violence has to happen just to keep things exactly the way they are.",
            "Six months have passed since we arrived here. We were taken straight from graduation, the first time they hitched wagons to motorcars instead of horses. It was as soon as we dropped our bags in the barracks that the Royal Guardsmen kept us busy in every waking moment, spending every second of daylight training in the militarized city of Gaffesend. ",
            "Yet that freedom ends today. ",
            "I find myself here in Gaffesend Tavern, sitting at a bartop, watching the bustling narrow street in front of the grand lake, wondering why my boyfriend Jullian hasn&apos;t bothered to approach me. ",
            "I hate drinking because it always makes me feel like I&apos;m too weak to face reality. Before long, I realize I&apos;m not watching the exits &mdash; and the more I keep pace with my male comrades, the more I find some stupid hope that this dizziness might shake my own feelings loose. I swirl the crimson ale around in the wooden mug to free the bubbles, envying how easily they float to the surface. ",
            "An hour passes since the close of labour. The cobblestone streets bustle with villagers returning home from a long day&apos;s work. There are four of us that watch from the window, entranced by the balance of energy between two worlds. Now is that rare hour when the drunken stupor of the pub&apos;s regulars matches the stumble of the tiresome commoners. The sun has already vanished below the mountains, but its colorful influence reflects across the lake.",
            "I get the spins as my childhood friend Bertram talks to Ryder and Naya, two shy recruits that would sit alone if we weren&apos;t all friends. None of us would be here if they weren&apos;t dangling the keys to our new homes at the end of it, forcing us all to weather the best and worst of our graduating class. Somewhere behind us, the others laugh and cheer. They&apos;ve convinced themselves that this transition is a triumphant victory, too shortsighted to see that life in Gaffesend rides on the results of an enervating final test. ",
            "And here it comes.",
            "There&apos;s no more simulations, practice runs, or drills. Failure is a one-way ticket to the front lines, and I will never get another chance.",
            "I take another sip, coaxing that feeling of joy to wash over me. I can tell that Bertram thinks the same thoughts when his eyes rest on the village on the other side of the lake. He nudges my right arm before opening his mouth to speak, gesturing to the twelve other trainees behind him.",
            "&quot;To them it&apos;s just a random assignment, no more than the toss of a coin. But to you and I, and maybe Ryder, this is divine. This is the will of the Gods, Katiya. This is the first sentence in our declaration of war.&quot;",
            "I tell him it is, and with my next swallow of ale, I prove it.",
            "The details are hazy. My mind protects me by forgetting everything I witnessed as a young child, and the harder I push to excise them, the deeper they dig. All I have left is the memory of Bertram pulling me from the smoldering cabin, dragging me to my mother Stella so that our fractured families could escape to the south.",
            "&quot;For years I was so angry,&quot; I tell him. &quot;If I could have joined the forces then, I would have put off all the schooling. I would have gone straight to the front lines to find justice for what they did to us.&quot;",
            "&quot;So why didn&apos;t you?&quot; He asks with a smirk.",
            "I shrug. &quot;How could all Chymaerans be evil if there are people like Pax that have their blood?&quot;",
            "I gesture to the half-blooded halfwit behind us. Paxton uses his Chymaeran Essence to try to freeze the watered-down liquor, enough to stack a seventh shot glass as the others cheer him on, drawing the attention of all the other patrons. Even Ryder puts his book down for a second to watch, letting out a small chuckle as it wavers.",
            "&quot;You have honor and a kind heart, and it&apos;s what I like about you. What I always have,&quot; Bertram says. He leans close enough that I can feel his firm shoulder press against mine. &quot;But keep enough of that anger. If we don&apos;t make the program &mdash; or if the enemy breaks the lines and crosses the lake in the winter &mdash; that fury is the only thing that&apos;s going to keep us alive.&quot;",
            "&quot;Rest assured it runs in my circuits with the Essence,&quot; I tell him. &quot;The long winter ends with our probation. It&apos;s spring now, and we have a&mdash;&quot;",
            "My words cut short when the tower crashes on the eighth glass. Pax presses his face to the table&apos;s surface, sucking up whatever he can of the liquor and the attention. ",
            "But I still find that I&apos;m unable to escape the gravity of that feeling &mdash; that dragging desire that&apos;s followed me since the beginning. The desire to have that one moment that validates all of it, that makes it all worth something. And I pray to the Gods that longing is stronger than the fear of what lies ahead. "

It&apos;s why I have the kegs here, to try to loosen you up a little,&quot; he says, taking another swig as if it will get him one sip closer to connecting with us. &quot;Trust me, lads. There&apos;s fear in every class &mdash; I&apos;ve seen fifteen in my time, and the reaction is the same every night before. But I want you to understand that you are not fighting for a limited number of slots. There is not a set number: you have already proved your excellence in the Capital. And if you keep that excellence, you will join us. I mean, Katiya&apos;s brother Erik joined us last year.&quot; He turns to me for validation. &quot;Didn&apos;t Erik say it wasn&apos;t that bad?&quot;",

            "&quot;This system hearkens back to the old days. Back to those centuries ago when the world was vastly unexplored: those centuries when bands of brave adventurers took tasks to be paid in Kine, back when the empire&apos;s reach was shorter. When ruins and old dungeons were unexplored, before we could raise whole armies with the singnal single &mdash;&quot; he stutters, wetting his tongue with another sip&mdash; &quot;erm, single signal, of a wire.&quot; He waves the document in his hand, and the air is quiet enough to hear the heavy wax seal shake the paper. &quot;This is the lifeblood of our operation. We call them quests.&quot;",

            "&quot;But it&apos;s not slaying monsters. Or, at least, not most of them. Maybe one of our elders has a problem with rats that savaged her Essenced crops, and they might start a fire if they gnaw the wires. Maybe it&apos;s a domestic dispute that needs authority. Or maybe it&apos;s a family near the eastern border that wants to feel safe.",
            "Those are the ones I&apos;ll take, I think.",

You&apos;ve worked for years and years to get out into the world beyond the capital, and here you are! You better be damn sure that you live up to that. Get closer with the people of our town.

I had some fun, but I was too busy for anything meaningful. And as the only child left in my family, my parents beg for grandchildren like I used to beg for sleepovers on the weekends.

            "&quot;I&apos;m just glad it comes with a washer and dryer. Otherwise I&apos;d have to buy new clothes every week.&quot;",
            "&quot;Dear Lord, Alan. Did we raise him?&quot; She turns to my father. &quot;Did he forget how to wash clothes some time in college?&quot;",
            "&quot;He&apos;ll be fine, Kim,&quot; Dad says. ",
            "It humors us when she gets the panicked look on her face. Neither of us can tell if it&apos;s a joke.",
            "&quot;You remember? She&apos;s only washed my clothes since I got back from school. I think I remember how to do it.&quot;",
            "&quot;But you need to keep your shirts nice. For work,&quot; she says. &quot;You need to iron them. Did you get an ironing board?&quot;",
            "&quot;I get it. I know, and I will, tomorrow,&quot; I tell her. &quot;You remember I&apos;ve been working there for two years, right? Everybody just wears jeans. Some even T-shirts.&quot;",
            "Dad&apos;s face furrows at the thought. &quot;Dressing like that won&apos;t get you a promotion.&quot;",
            "&quot;Well, they make fun of me when I dress up enough to tuck in my shirt. Saying I&apos;m trying to take their jobs.&quot;",
            "&quot;Well, then . . .&quot; Dad starts, but his words trail off. ",
            "The silence returns to us: it&apos;s a pivotal moment in our relationship. They were empty-nesters for four years, and right when they got used to it, they had me again for another two.  The childhood home will be so quiet: maybe it deafens them. I remember my mom kept the room and bed so neat every time I returned from college.",
            "Maybe there are phases to it, just like my late brother&apos;s room was all those years ago. It was as still as a museum for months. All his books and participation trophies were scattered thoughtfully as if he had just left the house to go see friends for a really, really long time, his letterman&apos;s jacket glistening with pins on the chair, and I almost thought they were planning on putting the whole room behind glass, until one windy day showed them it&apos;d be safer in seventeen boxes. ",
            "Cardboard. ",
            "Not like the polished wooden box beneath the ground, protecting all the things the war couldn&apos;t take.",
            "They head towards the door and turn the knob, still chipper despite how it drags on all of us, and my father wants to show it the least. ",
            "I almost think I can hear his voice crack. &quot;Just promise us you&apos;ll visit, right? Dinner next week?&quot; And to make it less emasculating, he adds, &quot;Your mother will go nuts if she can&apos;t do a load of laundry at least once a month.&quot;",
            "&quot;I swear I&apos;ll never do it again,&quot; she says.",
            "&quot;I promise,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;And maybe you can bring over a girl,&quot; Dad says. &quot;Don&apos;t get me wrong. You did great in school, but we&apos;re never gonna have grandchildren at this rate.&quot;",
            "&quot;Oh, Alan,&quot; Mom says. I think she&apos;s gonna shake her head or admonish him. ",
            "But she surprises me. ",
            "&quot;You&apos;re right. Wasn&apos;t there a reason Cody insisted on that queen-size bed?&quot;",
            "&quot;And the spare bedroom. He&apos;s smart. Put a bed in there and he&apos;s got a fine doghouse.&quot;",
            "&quot;Oh. The gaming room, you mean?&quot; I ask, and they&apos;re half out the door before Dad answers.",
            "&quot;Lonely girls his age start collecting cats. I just pray you don&apos;t do that with games on that computer program you were showing me.&quot;",
            "I hold the smile though their words cut me, though they don&apos;t realize it. ",
            "This isn&apos;t the way I wanted this memory to end.",
            "&quot;Maybe you can get that girl from work to come over. The older one you went to prom with. The asian one,&quot; Dad says.",
            "&quot;That&apos;s enough,&quot; I tell him.",
            "I give my mother and father a hug. I squeeze my mother a little longer because she likes them, and I swear I can feel her tremble, just a little, and when they head for the car, my mother chokes on the last words before she&apos;ll probably lose it.",
            "&quot;We love you, Cody. We&apos;re so proud of you,&quot; she says, loud enough that all my new neighbors can hear.",
            "&quot;Thanks. I love you too,&quot; I say.",
            "I wave for a while as they depart, blasting the 80s love songs through their windows as my father ducks his head.",
            "I retreat through the threshold of the doorway, hesitating to close the door or else the suddenness of this new chapter might give me whiplash. A couple tears leave my eyes. I sniff. It&apos;s a bright March day, and somewhere beyond the spotless windows, the birds sing songs in staccato, coupled with the chattering rumble of new construction.",
            "I flick the lights on, then off, then on again, then settle for off. I sit at the head of the glass dining table to find myself in a familiar headspace, from all those years ago in college, when my roommates left to drive home to their families, and flying for me wasn&apos;t an option. In the small closet beneath the stairs is the Bankers Box, and somewhere inside my head I wonder how I can ever reignite those old passions.",
            "I sit there until tinnitus rings in my ears. I don&apos;t feel like gaming, going for a walk, or saying hello to the neighbors. I love my parents to pieces, but their words still cut me. I mean, I&apos;m twenty-six years old: is this the age where you start to really believe you&apos;ll be alone forever? ",
            "The comebacks always come to you long after they&apos;re useful. I open the fridge my mom overstocked with frozen food from Costco in case I starve in the next three months and grab an off-brand seltzer, returning to darkness when the door closes. ",
            "Then maybe he should have stayed. He was smarter, more attractive, more alive than I can ever be, I could have said. Communication was what killed him. And I refuse to harm my relationship with my parents over it. But really, what do they think? Some neighbor girl is going to stumble in here looking for love?",
            "The thoughts get me nowhere, but the seltzer does. And when the clock reads 8:00 PM, three deep with the gold-painted cans standing like little league trophies on the finely-polished counter, I&apos;m finally able to forget. And I forget even easier when he stumbles through the open door.",
            "&quot;Beer later, wey. Wanna hotbox my car?&quot;",
            "He slicks his black hair back before dragging his feet on my mat, carrying a rack of cheap beer with an OfficeMax nametag pinned upside-down."

            "The next lucid moment, I find myself pinned upside-down beneath a thick wooden rack. The heat climbs as I drag my heels across the floor, my clothes so black and charred that I pray my sweaty flesh might slick me back through the narrow space. Within the hot box of crackling logs and scalding cinders, the roar of recircling flames makes the house screech in agony when its bones crunch and crumble, casting twigs and thatch to the ashen floor.",
            "The twisting and thrashing gets me nowhere, but when a log column crashes into the thin floor, the rack slides into the hollow foundation. My body is so small and pathetic, but I&apos;m barely able to command my cramped muscles to escape, crawling across the floor as the smoke billows overhead, drawing shallow, stinging breaths into  my pinched lungs. ",
            "The log walls close in like long fingers of a burning fist that clenches, casting glowing rubies of raging ruin that spread like a rash across the cabin&apos;s bones, and as I gasp harder for desperate breaths, losing the strength of air to drive my muscles, I realize that all the windows and doors are missing.",
            "The heat would evaporate my tears if I had the fluids left to cry. All that&apos;s left is to feel how much I loathe this feeling of helplessness. Didn&apos;t I escape this crumbling crypt of cinders? Or was the full life I led after just a dream of a dying mind, denying its demise? Didn&apos;t Stella and Erik and Bertram treat my burns as we sought solitude on the outskirts of Northaven? Or is this the last memory of my soul in the Reservoir, preparing to be reborn?",
            "But this body is so weak and useless, and I lust so strongly for power, for Essence: Essence that might let me bend steel; to bash through the walls; to crush the skulls of the arsonists. I only wish I could live to return the favor, to get revenge for that fading image of their faces.",
            "But I&apos;m just a child, and nobody came.",
            "The last segment of wall collapses, and I join my father and sisters,  entombed forever beneath the rubble. ",
            "Or so I think, until I gasp for breath beneath the silken sheets of an unfamiliar bed."
         ],
         "Chapter 4 Scene 2": [
            "It takes a couple seconds before my mind is able to catch up on two decades of living history. It&apos;s not the first time my mind tormented me with visions of another life, one where the Gods of fortune hadn&apos;t intervened. My episodes were worse in the Barracks: so bad that they threw me in with all the other traumatized children of the war that tossed and turned too much in their sleep, waking the others with the foreshadowing shouts and screams of the slaughter that might await them.",
            "I always think I can be stronger. I always find myself thinking I can outmaneuver it, but it matters not how viciously I fight to comport myself. That poisonous malady of the soul is an everflowing source of suffering stronger than the sea. And even as I sit here with full recollection of everything that&apos;s brought me to this moment, I still can&apos;t shake that feeling of eternal freefall, that uncomfortable feathering in my stomach that casts my fingers and toes in phantom static, waiting and waiting for when I&apos;ll splatter against the end of this bottomless pit.",
            "But the end never comes. The only way, it seems, is to distract myself from the infinite fall, so that feeling becomes a lesser part of me. I&apos;ve tried hating it, but it never concedes. I&apos;ve tried overpowering it, but it&apos;s like sculpting water. So all I can do is follow the words of my father when these episodes would overtake me.",
            "Katiya, he would say. My beautiful daughter, you have to focus. Tell me, where are you right now?",
            "&quot;I&apos;m in the town of Gaffesend, across the lake from where we used to live,&quot; I mutter, clutching my chest with numbing fingers that hinge against my will. My other hand reaches for the left side of the bed as I call out his name, longing for a touch beyond lust, but the bed is cold again: damp with his sweat from our passions the night before.",
            "Where are you?",
            "&quot;I&apos;m in my new home. In the bedroom,&quot; I breathe. &quot;With plastered walls,&quot; I breathe. &quot;And a fan,&quot; I breathe, taking two breaths before the next distracting question comes to me I cast a look around as my eyes adjust from the dark of sleep to the brightness of morning.",
            "When are you?",
            "&quot;A near twenty years after I lost you.&quot; ",
            "It&apos;s the hundred-and-twenty-ninth year after the Fall. A long winter fades into spring as the world opens again, and I can smell the buds of flowers blooming in the wild spaces. &quot;I&apos;ve come back to find something I lost, I think,&quot; I add.",
            "And can you describe how you feel?",
            "My breaths are slowing. My heart is acclimating to the stillness, and my body is accepting there&apos;s nothing that threatens it, even though I&apos;ve already identified all the exits. I must have flamed a little in my sleep: there are small burn holes where my naked body pressed hardest against the fabric. The sheets are saturated with soot from the scalding heat my circuits must have risen, but that&apos;s not what upsets me the most. As the world returns to me, I can feel my fists ball on a different kind of anger.",
            "I thought the passion of the night before might have compelled Jullian him to stay. The feeling of that truth feels so palpable when he kisses me, and for the hour after, my mind floats on the joy of all we&apos;ve shared: watching each other&apos;s siblings; studying those long nights together; even training in the early mornings; and all the time we&apos;d set aside for each other despite everything.",
            "Maybe it&apos;s the annoyed sigh he breathes when I goad him on the morning runs around the village, one of our traditions. Or maybe it&apos;s in the listless tick he acquired any time we walk about the village. Or maybe it&apos;s in his new group of friends &mdash; though he&apos;s always longed for a group to belong to, and I don&apos;t fault him for any of that.",
            "But he wasn&apos;t here when I needed him. The only considerate act was topping off the Essence switch with a touch, allowing the ceiling fan enough energy to run until I awoke. His clothes vanished as if he was trying to clear a crime scene.",
            "After I release myself from the tangle of bedsheets, I  poke my head out the back window facing west &mdash; nearly forgetting to cover my breasts with the thick red curtain as I try to guess the time. It&apos;s a commerce street,  and the stalls are vacant without produce or trinkets, the stools still tucked beneath the counters. The merchants tend to gather an hour after sunrise, meaning it&apos;s long before the time that we were told to gather outside the officer post.",
            "I glance out the east window that looks out upon a quaint little garden: my tiny lawn with a walkway that divides it, enclosed by the spires of a wrought-iron fence. The mountain air is so crisp and fresh as it pours though the windows, wrapping around the curtain that covers my extremities, and when I lift my eyes to the Purgatory Mountains, feeling the morning sun radiate my skin, I find a captivating view of Lake Gaffesend.",
            "The Gods of fortune haven&apos;t forgotten me, I think: but I refuse to ever lean on them with all my weight.",
            "I find the closet furnished to the measurements I gave at Orientation, though almost everything seems to be genderless. The underwear is the only thing that&apos;s distinctly feminine, and after smelling myself to ensure the stench of sweat is not severe, I slip on a pair, and proceed to dress in the Royal Guard&apos;s underclothes.",
            "The white undershirt is baggy, but not too long in the sleeves. I&apos;m just relieved to not have to wear the same binder I wore for graduation. After six hours listening to names, thinking I&apos;d pass out from the pain in my back and ribs, I wondered why they call it a &quot;breastplate&quot; when it&apos;s flatter than the Capital fields. ",
            "But this is different armor: armor designed for show instead of function, for making the villagers feel safe, though the thin steel couldn&apos;t stop two thrashings from a sword. The steel only covers the shoulders, arms, hands, and chest, exposing the undershirt at the midriff. And beyond the showy sabatons on my feet, embellished with gold trim like all the rest of the armor that was never meant to get so much as a scratch, there are thin tassets that couldn&apos;t protect my hip from so much as a fall.",
            "I relish the feeling of excitement to try it on: anything that tears me from the lingering feeling in my stomach, and when I step into the washroom to look into the mirror, I imagine its guise before I even put it on.",
            "The person that looks back at me is carved as intentionally as the thousand sculptures my father whittled in the forest across the lake, carving the trimmings and stumps from his work as a carpenter. The only difference is in our intentions. His comes from that sedentary softness of imaginary inner peace, the very reason my parents settled in that village all those years ago. His showed in the soft shavings that split from the virgin bark, falling to the floor like petals as he perfected its form. But my intention lies in the real world, of flesh and blood. It lies in the continuous honing of my body to be ready for the fight that&apos;s coming &mdash; the approaching end to the long fall that forever turns my stomach &mdash; and I&apos;ll need every bit of strength I can gather to act as a breakwall, so that ruinous poison never spills over upon the innocents.",
            "I trace the definition in my abs, noticing all the imperfections I have yet to carve through training, trying to stop that self-immolating voice that says I will never be strong enough; that if not for Jullian, no one else would ever be attracted to someone like me. But this life has only ever been a sacrifice, since it should have been taken. I can&apos;t change my modest height, but I&apos;ve shaped just about everything else, and when I put on the undershirt, it covers all the weakness I have yet to improve.",
            "And now it&apos;s time to hone myself further."
         ],
         "Chapter 4 Scene 3": [
            "I descend the stairs in bare feet, carrying the thin cosmetic armor. The kitchen counters are vacant beyond some basic decorations: a bowl and a candle on every surface, what I&apos;ve learned is the bare minimum for any military-issued living space. Part of me hopes for an explanatory note from Jullian, but I find nothing, just my bag of possessions scattered across the floor.",
            "My stomach rumbles when my nose notices the commerce street is open. I spark the burners with Essence, throwing on some standard-issue porridge rations as I try to put on my second layer of clothing.",
            "A knock sounds on the door, rapping so hard that I should hear it anywhere in the house. It startles me when I&apos;m putting on the solid armor that refuses to give as I contort my body. It&apos;s an unfamiliar voice, but incredibly deep and charming.",
            "&quot;Miss Katiya, darling, it&apos;s time to wake up,&quot; he says.",
            "&quot;Coming.&quot; I try to dress faster while blinded, but forget I&apos;m standing in front of my bag of personal items.",
            "&quot;No need. I&apos;m a knocker commissioned by the Guard.&quot;",
            "My foot catches before I can respond. I crash to the ground with a high squeak, my arms bound by an arm hole.",
            "&quot;Miss Katiya . . . are you alright in there?&quot;",
            "I&apos;m certainly not right inside the armor.",
            "&quot;I&apos;m fine,&quot; I say, my head half-protruding from the head hole like a bashful turtle. My arms are all twisted inside the uncompromising metal. &quot;Thanks for the warning.&quot;",
            "&quot;Not a problem, love,&quot; he says. ",
            "As I struggle to free myself from my metal cocoon, I recognize that there&apos;s a hinged strap on the side: something that would have made the struggle a whole lot easier.",
            "But then a sizzling sound sets off behind me. I&apos;m so charged with Essence that I must&apos;ve transferred too much to the burner. The porridge bubbles over the edges of the pot, edging off the wooden spoon that bridged the center. Scrambling from the floor, I reach my hand to withdraw heat from the stove, feeling that transfer of energy return to my circuits.",
            "&quot;Gods damn it,&quot; I tell myself. And when I reach to grasp the handle of the pot, my foot slips in a mess of oats on the floor, casting a plume of molten chunks across the floorboards and the cabinetry.",
            "A voice rises from the other side of the house: a different pitch with the same sentiment.",
            " &quot;You alright in there, Rayna?&quot;",
            "Rayna? Who&apos;s Rayna?",
            "&quot;Yeah, just a little accident,&quot; I say. &quot;Looks like I&apos;ll be skipping breakfast.&quot;",
            "&quot;You can&apos;t miss breakfast if you&apos;re defending the village,&quot; he says. &quot;Come to the window.&quot;",
            "&quot;One second,&quot; I say, before throwing my armor on the right way, finding  buckles and straps that are stitched there for a reason. When I&apos;m sufficiently sharp, clothed in bright crimson and silver that&apos;s trimmed with gold, I reach for the window sill to drag it open.",
            "A stocky, bald man squats on one of the stools in the shadow of the building, his collection of fresh breads proudly displayed across the front of the booth.",
            "&quot;You&apos;re not Rayna. Your voice sure sounds like hers, though. Are you a friend?&quot;",
            "&quot;This is my house,&quot; I tell him. &quot;I just moved in.&quot;",
            "&quot;Oh. Sorry,&quot; he says. &quot;Well, you&apos;re certainly prettier than she was!&quot;",
            "Someone slaps him across the face. I bend down to see where it came from, and it&apos;s his wife, unloading the rest of their produce: they must have just arrived.",
            "&quot;I&apos;m Derry. And this is my wife, Carmen. We sell fresh bread here every morning.&quot; I shake their hands, bending awkwardly to meet their eyes from four feet off of street level.",
            "&quot;The last girl preferred waking to the smell of fresh bread,&quot; Carmen says. &quot;She regaled us with tales of her quests in exchange for a loaf. Maybe you can do the same?&quot;",
            "My peckishness speaks first. ",
            "&quot;Of course. What do I owe you?&quot; I ask, drawing my fingers into my coin purse for a couple Kine.",
            "&quot;The first one&apos;s free, because I think you&apos;ll make a great customer. It&apos;s fresh, with a special blend of spices in there,&quot; he insists.",
            "His wife turns from unloading the cart. &quot;Say, what happened to the other girl?&quot;",
            " I withdraw the key from my pocket: without the cover of night or blurred vision, I can inspect it a lot easier. The surface is rough where her name was ground away. I can see the shape of her letters interspersed between mine. It&apos;s been sanded enough that I&apos;m sure she&apos;s not the first: it&apos;s evident that the names of cadets were stacked and scratched nearly halfway through the metal shaft &mdash; at least twenty of them &mdash; and I doubt all those tenants left to move into a permanent home.",
            "The brief pang of fear surprises me, nearly overriding my hunger.",
            "&quot;A shame she was drafted,&quot; Derry says, but his face lightens. &quot;But you seem lovely, too. Keep us entertained with stories of your little . . . quests, and we&apos;ll share a little,&quot; he insists.",
            "&quot;I can do that,&quot; I manage: tempted, but too timid to ask how many faces they&apos;ve seen before.",
            "&quot;And what&apos;s your name, dear?&quot;",
            "&quot;Katiya. Miss Katiya Breakey,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;You have a wonderful day, Miss Katiya,&quot; he says, flashing a toothy smile before handing me a steaming breakfast bun.",
            "The hunger is more persuasive than the urge to clean the mess. I rush through the front door with the delicious bread dissolving between my teeth, and as I turn to set the lock, I catch the sight of a familiar face. ",
            "Bertram struggles to bend down and tie his boot. I&apos;m not the only one that&apos;s not used to the armor.",
            "&quot;It&apos;s like the old village all over again,&quot; I shout.",
            "It startles him. He mulls over a response as I approach, struggling harder to tie a simple knot. &quot;Less fire, though. I hope it stays that way.&quot;",
            "&quot;Speaking of disasters,&quot; I say, &quot;I don&apos;t mind watching you struggle for a while, but are you going to let me help you?&quot;",
            "Bertram blushes, then nods. I stoop down to tame his laces, laughing at how stiffly he stands on the porch.",
            "&quot;You know, you&apos;re supposed to tie them BEFORE you can&apos;t bend over,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;I would surely remember if this nagging headache went away. I think I lost part of my mind last night. Say &mdash; where&apos;s double-L? Didn&apos;t you leave with him?&quot;",
            "&quot;I did.&quot;",
            "&quot;But he didn&apos;t stay,&quot; he replies.",
            "&quot;I guess not,&quot; I tell him. ",
            "He looks like he&apos;s about to add some commentary, but hinges his mouth shut before the insults can fly, settling instead for something else. &quot;Should we walk together?&quot;",
            "&quot;That sounds great.&quot;",
            " &quot;And maybe every morning?&quot;",
            "&quot;That sounds even better.&quot;",
            "The walk is quick since we already live in the military district, a few blocks from the boundary of the Gaffe Royal Base. We discuss the letters from our families, the identical layout of our houses, our headaches, and reminisce on the few moments of joy we experienced together in the capital.",
            "With my best friend here, I can almost convince myself that it&apos;s all going to be alright, and I relish in the nostalgia of shared memories. The feeling carries all the way until we arrive at the posting board, ready to start on our first day."

            "&quot;Since you started on your first day, you haven&apos;t been drug tested. What&apos;s gonna change their mind on Monday, bro? My work never runs drug tests,&quot; he says. Gunfire cracks over the TV, flashing the empty walls with pops of color.",
            "&quot;No shit, Miguel. Their corporate structure banks on baked box-boys like you. The ones that forget they&apos;re lifting crates and stocking shelves and selling printers for eight hours a day.&quot;",

            "The words hit at the same time as a round-ending enemy airstrike. The bombs collapse my soldier to the dirt as the word DEFEAT brandishes across the screens, reassuring us that &quot;we&apos;ll get them next time.&quot; But his quips hurt no more than the vibrations in the controller.",
            " Miguel cracks another lukewarm beer, kicking the box of the remaining 27 over to me. I put down my custom controller.",
            " &quot;I get bringing over a six-pack of some IPA, maybe a 12-pack of Coors or something, but thirty?&quot;",
            "He manages a straight face as his brown eyes pierce mine, wiping the suds from his scruffy lip rug. &quot;You know, Jesus was wrong when he said &apos;man can&apos;t live on bread alone.&apos; He didn&apos;t know you could drink it yet.&quot;",

            "&quot;Well, I took her friend home and stole the thirty-rack since no one touched it. Those guys are all fuckin&apos; hipsters, man, so far up their ass about IPA&apos;s and stuff, they won&apos;t drink just to get drunk anymore.&quot;",
            "&quot;Coming from the guy who doesn&apos;t smoke just to get high,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Passionate stoners are worse than drinkers. You couldn&apos;t be any more uninteresting when you&apos;re talking about &apos;Sour Dee&apos; or whatever,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Fuck off.&quot;",
            "He burps. I crack another warm one, and when the timer on the pre-game lobby counts to zero, I lift my controller again. But he hits me with something that isn&apos;t just a snide comeback.",
            "&quot;Do you miss high school?&quot; He asks.",
            "It takes me a moment to think. I haven&apos;t really considered it, though I&apos;ve noticed myself staying away from those places we hung out between classes and after school. Those places have some gravity I&apos;m afraid will get me sucked into that past, when I&apos;ve worked so hard to put those good times behind me.",
            "&quot;I dunno. It&apos;s like a friend you haven&apos;t seen in a while. Nice to visit every once in a while and relish in the past. But it&apos;s best for both of us if we move on, you know?&quot; ",
            "He drops the controller into his lap. My thumbs dig into the sticks when I climb a ladder for a sniper nest, only to get blasted off by a camper.",

            "&quot;I&apos;m messing with you, fucker,&quot; he says. ",
            "He laughs, swigging the rest of his beer between deaths.",
            "He says, &quot;I do. I mean, a part of me does. I hated high school until the end of junior year when our group really started to hang out. It&apos;s like, I never felt like I was a part of something until then. And . . . I don&apos;t know if I really felt it since.&quot;",
            "&quot;Yeah. I wonder what the others are up to,&quot; I ask.",
            "&quot;Kayla&apos;s having her second kid already. Another girl, I think. Her and Johnny Boy are still together.&quot;",
            "&quot;I was surprised. Getting married half a year after high school? I didn&apos;t think they&apos;d make it this far.&quot;",
            "&quot;You never went to their wedding, though.&quot;",
            "&quot;I was in college halfway across the country, bud,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;How about Kei?&quot; He asks. &quot;You were trying to get with her for a while, but you never had the cajones to do it before she graduated after our junior year.&quot;",
            "&quot;I&apos;ve told you before,&quot; I say. &quot;She&apos;s at my work.&quot;",
            "&quot;No shit!&quot; He laughs. &quot;Puta madre, the yellow thirst was real for you, man.&quot; He cracks another can after getting mowed down by an LMG. &quot;Are you gonna shoot your shot? You told me you got some experience in college, right?&quot;",
            "&quot;Yeah. But I don&apos;t know...&quot; none of those nights in college really fulfilled me. I was always missing something. &quot;I&apos;m not into the clubbing scene like you are.&quot;",
            "&quot;All you have to do is ask! It&apos;s not like high school. Alcohol changes things. The fellas I met in college showed me all around the city. I know that shit like the front of my hand!&quot;",
            "&quot;Back. The back of your hand,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Whatever. But we need to get you laid, now that you got this fine house. Shit, man, I wish I could afford something like this. People our age probably never will.&quot;",
            "&quot;But you still live here in Hearthland Ridge,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Paying for a studio! Like living in a fuckin&apos; box for seventeen hundred a month,&quot; he says. &quot;Walls so paper-thin I can hear everything. I&apos;d rather go out and get some pussy than cuck myself to the soundtrack of someone else getting it.&quot;",
            "&quot;Uh, sure,&quot; I say &mdash; sometimes I wonder if he tries to fit as many of those words as he can into a sentence. ",
            "&quot;But really. I&apos;m proud of you, man,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Really. You&apos;ve worked hard and you&apos;ve made it. When I was trying to work my way through our senior class, you were grinding at math and shit. You have an actual chance to get wifed up. It&apos;s not in my blood.&quot;",
            "&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.",
            "&quot;Well, I don&apos;t want to. I like the chase better,  you know. Settling down? That&apos;s like giving up. What do you do, then? With that feeling, you know, when you have a couple rats with some chick and you know you&apos;re locked in for the next forever?&quot;",
            "The feeling&apos;s all I&apos;ve been able to think about since I got back here. No more regimentation. No convenient road map of class to class to graduation: now it&apos;s all just open-ended.",
            "&quot;But, like, nothing against you if you&apos;re into that. Having rats can be dope. They mow your lawn and shit.&quot;",
            "&quot;Someday. Maybe. I&apos;m just too boring, I think,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Boring? You were the heart of our group back then, dude. You brought us together. You&apos;re good at that.&quot;",
            "&quot;But nothing&apos;s forcing any of us to be together anymore,&quot; I say. &quot;Look at how many have moved away from here. It&apos;s just you and me now, right?&quot;",
            "&quot;Kayla and John are in California. Michael went to Kansas. He likes flat woman, so I guess he wants a state that can get him off just by driving on the roads.&quot;",
            "The beer comes up my nose. I drop the controller and the batteries pop out. &quot;Ugh. Fuck, man,&quot; I say, balancing the pain of carbonation in my nose with the urge to laugh, imagining Mike trying to stick his wiener in a Kansas anthill.",
            "Miguel says, &quot;Maybe we&apos;ll be stuck here forever. But hey, as long as we&apos;re both here.&quot;",
            "&quot;I just wish . . .&quot; I start to say, but instead, I reach down and pop the batteries back in the controller.",
            "He slicks his hair back again, finishing another one. &quot;Is it cool if I crash here? I mean, I can drive high, but not drunk.&quot;",
            "&quot;Sure, man. But I don&apos;t have a cot or a sleeping bag or anything.&quot;",
            "&quot;Please. I&apos;ve slept on floors my whole adult life!&quot; He gestures to the box with 23 stones left. &quot;Now are you gonna help me finish all of them?&quot;",
            "&quot;All of them?&quot;",
            "&quot;All of them,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s Friday. I know we&apos;re old and shit now, but stay awake a little longer, like we&apos;re twelve and it&apos;s a sleepover in your parents&apos; basement, and I&apos;ll tell you a bedtime story.&quot;",
            "&quot;Oh, great. About what?&quot;",
            "&quot;One time I was playing on your Xbox when you were out of town. When you had me pet-sitting, and...&quot;",
            "&quot;I&apos;ll pass. But&mdash;&quot; I think, as long as I&apos;m not drinking alone, it can&apos;t hurt. What&apos;s the worst that can happen?"

            "&quot;No, I get what you&apos;re saying, but what do you mean?&quot; Miguel says, slurring his words as he melts into the futon: the only piece of furniture our drunk asses could assemble. The overturned boxes are makeshift tables that keep the cans off the floor, since we&apos;re feeling too lazy to dig for a trash bag.",
            "I lift the can to my lips, but I don&apos;t let the poison pass the threshold. Past experience tells me that I&apos;m toeing my limit: lost enough to let my stupid emotions leak on my face, to conjure words to try to push them down, but not enough to kneel at the porcelain throne. I know the feeling is real because the wetness on my face gives it credence, and I often think he&apos;s the only friend I&apos;ve got left to listen.",
            "If only I could get him to.",
            "&quot;How can you get it if you don&apos;t know what I mean?&quot; I ask.",
            "&quot;I get it, bro, just not what you mean.&quot; Miguel lifts the cracked smartphone above his face as he lays on the futon, thumb-scrolling through an endless barrage of ads and entertainment. ",
            "&quot;What I mean is that I don&apos;t feel it anymore. My life is just work, then sleep, then work, then go to sleep, but it&apos;s nothing more than that. I don&apos;t have it like you do. You always have the energy, but I don&apos;t know how you find it.&quot; The tears leak further: I can&apos;t remember the last time I was drunk enough to let them out. &quot;But I know the time is in between there somewhere, I mean, I&apos;m certain I could fit in anything if I tried. But I&apos;m always just so damn tired.&quot;",
            "He swipes right a couple times in a dating app, still refusing to look up. &quot;Time isn&apos;t the only thing that&apos;s too small of yours to fit.&quot; He laughs. Then the vibration from a match startles him. ",
            "Miguel&apos;s thumb slips and he flings his phone in the air, letting out a grunt when it crashes into his nose.He jolts upright to rub the pain out, looking at me for the first time in an hour.",
            "&quot;Oh, shit. You&apos;re serious.&quot;",
            "&quot;Yeah, you think this is just a bit?&quot;",
            "&quot;No, of course not.&quot; He sets his phone on a cardboard box and thinks for a moment. &quot;Why I &apos;feel it.&apos; I don&apos;t know . . . I guess I just got a big family that always keeps me busy. My cousins are young, and my siblings are still in college, so I end up going to their parties and stuff.&quot;",
            "&quot;So it&apos;s like college never ended for you. Never realized I&apos;d miss it so much . . . my roommates made the damn experience,&quot; I say. It didn&apos;t matter if we were in the dorms or slumming it in an expensive renter-fixer-upper west of campus: those fuckers forced me to get out. &quot;Most nights, when I was studying in my bedroom, nose stuck in a textbook, they&apos;d pick the lock and barge in &mdash; shooting me with flaming Nerf darts, assaulting me with a pizza cutter, or dragging me to one of their parties.&quot;",
            "He takes the last swig of his seventh can. &quot;Just like my older cousins. They show up to my house to drag me clubbing, even if I pulled a &apos;tenner&apos; at work.&quot;",
            "&quot;Man. If my brother was still around, I&apos;m sure he&apos;d be over here all the time,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Of course. Our families had a lot of fun together: barbeques, parties at the park...&quot; The list trails off when he crunches the can in his hands.",
            "&quot;You remember those weekends in middle school when we tried to beat the Halo campaign in a single night?&quot;",
            "&quot;Yeah. And your brother would buy all those energy drinks, sneaking them downstairs for us,&quot; he says. &quot;Oh, and the summer tent sleepovers, remember that one night you were so scared of the lightning you couldn&apos;t move, and my dad had to carry you back inside?&quot;",
            "&quot;I was stuck in the sleeping bag, so soaking wet from the rain I almost slid out of his arms,&quot; I say. We share a laugh. &quot;Or the RV trip we took for the out-of-state Lacrosse game&mdash;when we got stuck on the side of the road. We used up all the power playing GameCube and my dad was furious!&quot;",
            "He laughs. &quot;Yeah. And we had to ask one of the families running behind to pick us up. The whole time we waited there, your dad was screaming at Triple-A, and your mom was trying to cook, but the RV tipped so far to the side that she couldn&apos;t set anything on the counter...&quot;",
            "&quot;...And all we could do was just pass the ball on the side of the road, wondering whether or not we were gonna make the game.&quot;",
            "&quot;But we won that one, right?&quot;",
            "&quot;Yeah &mdash; I ripped the game-winning corner pocket.&quot;",
            "&quot;Oh yeah. Their team was trash. The goalie scored on himself.&quot;",
            "The nostalgia can only abate the emptiness for so long. I take another swig, feeling the body high mix with the dizziness from the flat beer. Without them, the next words might not have left me.",
            "&quot;But now it&apos;s just like . . . I dunno. I only know that it sucks, you know?&quot;",
            "&quot;Of course.&quot;",
            "&quot;Like, I&apos;m trying to care, but I don&apos;t. My mind doesn&apos;t want me to be happy.&quot; I nearly fall out of the folding chair when I&apos;m talking with my arms. &quot;We&apos;re not forced to get out there anymore. To meet new people, to keep friendships alive. All our friends are getting married or serious while we&apos;re just left behind. My parents nag me about it all the time: getting impatient since I&apos;m the only one left that&apos;ll keep the family name going. And&mdash;&quot;",
            "&quot;That shit doesn&apos;t matter. That&apos;s not what it&apos;s about,&quot; Miguel says. That video of you, dude, the one on the news, you remember? I think about that shit a lot: it was dope, man.&quot;",
            "He&apos;s gaslighting me again.",
            "&quot;And what did I say?&quot;",
            "&quot;You just gotta do, man. You gotta do things just to do them.&quot;",
            "I furrow my brows. &quot;To do what?&quot;",
            "He wets his lips on a last sip before he tries at something profound.",
            "&quot;The doing is what makes happiness come, when even . . . even when you&apos;re, like, not happy, and shit, you force yourself to do things, so happy shit can happen more often and shit, so you can have the chance to enjoy it,&quot; he insists. ",
            "I&apos;m lost without words, so he decides to muddy the waters even further.",
            "&quot;You get the gist of what I&apos;m saying? Like, you have to decide to do no matter what. Like even when you don&apos;t feel like it, you know, you do. The doing, I mean, is something you choose which gives a chance of something good. Or something, at least. You know?&quot;I feel like I just had a seizure. &quot;What the fuck does that even mean?&quot;",
            "&quot;I don&apos;t know, man. Maybe I&apos;m bad at . . . no, maybe you suck at listening,&quot; he says. &quot;I said that shit perfectly.&quot;",
            "I mutter to myself, trying to piece together what he said. It takes me a couple seconds. &quot;Force yourself to engage with the world. Give happiness its best chance to come out, because it&apos;s all you can do.&quot;",
            "&quot;That&apos;s exactly what I said!&quot; He snatches another can, using the light of the TV to inspect all the dents from rolling around in his Corolla.",
            "&quot;Like hell you did!&quot; I roll my eyes.",
            "His verbal seizure must have made him tired. He puts the can down instead of cracking another one, and after a long yawn, he pulls the unzipped sleeping bag off the floor and wraps it around himself on the futon.&quot;That thing goes down flat, you know,&quot; I offer. &quot;It doesn&apos;t have to be a couch.&quot;",
            "&quot;Too much effort. I&apos;ve slept on worse,&quot; he says. &quot;I gotta get to sleep so I can make it to church tomorrow.&quot;",
            "&quot;And show up hungover? I doubt you&apos;ll make it through the service,&quot; I say. &quot;But, hey, if you stay a while after, I&apos;m sure you could catch the double-A meeting.&quot;",
            "He&apos;s too tired for a clap-back. He&apos;s not even scrolling his phone anymore: just sprawled there with his feet dangling over the wobbly armrest, arms tucked beneath him, his face buried into a folded towel.",
            "I glance at the stove. &quot;It&apos;s only like 12:30.&quot;",
            "&quot;Long day . . . leading idiots . . . feels so late,&quot; he says, turning to bury his face in the leather crevice of the couch.",

I thought we&apos;d be at the enemy&apos;s doorstep most days, waiting for one of them to break through.&quot; He chows down on a raw potato that he withdraws from his pocket, spitting scraps with every syllable. &quot;But this is great &mdash; a little work for as much produce as you can eat!&quot;",

Bertram and I shiver in their shade as we struggle for footing, stumbling down the switchbacks of the southern foothills. Despite the half-baked ramblings that often get him in trouble, Pax is right this time. There wasn&apos;t a single scouting mission on the board beyond patrolling the town.",

It&apos;s stamped and scribbled with an illiterate farmer&apos;s signature, dirtied from folding by my soil-soaked fingers. Something catches my eye before we turn another corner: a small statement that the guildscribes helped the farmer write, the only part of the form scrawled in coherent letters.",

            "The space beyond the door frame spans for less than a foot before the faint candlelight is swallowed by darkness. But the darkness is so dense and miasmic, like peering through murky water.",
            "The tunnel opens itself to me as I approach the door. From the lines implied by the floors and walls, the small cupboard should be no deeper than a couple feet (enough to store winter uniforms and snowshoes for the cold season), but I find no definite end. The edge where the splintered floor meets the jagged wall just fades into obscurity, all the way though to the unit on the other side, where an unfamiliar twinkle of multicolored lights pierce the smooth walls.",
            "The corridor might be short, but it&apos;s still just a little too long. The neighboring wall would have to be deeper than the walls around Fort Gaffesend!",
            "It must be a trick of his.  He could be a cross-blood like Pax, except Auvryan; able to mess with minds; skilled enough in his race&apos;s  gift to conjure convincing illusions with his Essence. Maybe that&apos;s why he seemed so powerless with his Human gifts. Maybe he conjured that splitting headache before I barged in, or maybe he speaks through thoughts, unaccustomed to verbal speech, speaking words of a foreign language though my mind heard something else. Is my mind being twisted further, to show something that isn&apos;t there? Does he still deceive me from beyond the door? I refuse to fall for this pathetic excuse of a trick, so I decide to test the bewildering portal.",
            "I reach first with my gauntlet, dragging through the viscous black as if collapsing spiderwebs. I notice the breeze at my back, strong enough to pierce the layers of my uniform, ushering me deeper and deeper. My trembling hand passes where the wall should be, and then my arm, and then the rest of my body, and as all the sound of the quaint cottage and the outside world fade behind me, I realize I&apos;m twice as deep as the rules of space should allow. I think of the old stories of the Verdalans, the masters of space whose bodies descended from the fibrous jungle, defending their ancient capital with an infinite wall of twisting jungle. Just as their Essence warped space, entrapping their adversaries in endless loops of attrition, I feel my stomach twist as my senses confirm a truth that the mind refuses to accept.",
            "The room is dark, and though I can&apos;t make out the meager spread of items, I can sense how strange the shapes in this room are: so smooth and straight, as if they were cut by divine hands. When I find a glint in the artifacts on the shelves and walls&mdash;even the shelves themselves&mdash;I marvel at how much metal must have been wasted to produce all these things. He must be rich if he can waste money like this: maybe he&apos;s so rich that he bribed the Guard to let him live here, in a prime spot looking across the water.",
            "Does he actually live next door? Did I really mistake this as a closet? My metal boots clatter like hooves against the reflective wood floor, and I trace my finger along the polished granite table, trying to imagine how the resources got here.",
            "A crunch startles me. On the floor are what looks like hand-painted ration cans, but they&apos;re all crushed and ruined.",
            "I&apos;m startled again when I hear snoring in the corner, and I find another odd stranger. A friend? A lover? Maybe a visitor past curfew? My feet sink into the carpet when I approach him, wondering again how the scruffy noble could ever afford such luxurious flooring.",
            "The entire room stinks of man, but this one smells especially bad. He mumbles in a drunken stupor before he awakes, blinking his eyes like a toad.",
            "&quot;Uh . . . hey.&quot;",
            "&quot;Hello,&quot; I say, wishing I had not ditched the dagger.",
            "He asks, &quot;And you are?&quot;",
            "&quot;Katiya. Katiya Breakey-Hilde,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;My homie&apos;s got no chill if he&apos;s bringing girls like you over while I&apos;m here. Must be desperate since he&apos;s got no hoes.&quot;",
            "&quot;A hose? Why would you&mdash;&quot; I begin to ask, but he cuts me off.",
            "&quot;I think he&apos;s upstairs,&quot; he tells me, squinting his eyes, and then some semblance of recognition crosses his face. &quot;Wait a minute &mdash; you must be from that fantasy escort service down in Denver, what was it called, uh . . . Call To Adventure, or something like that?&quot;",
            "&quot;I only do escort missions through the Royal Guard,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Hah. Good one,&quot; he says.",
            "&quot;It is good,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Good.&quot; He clicks his tongue. &quot;Figures. My boy Cody could never score a baddie like you.&quot;",
            "&quot;Cody,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Yep.&quot;",
            "An odd name.",
            "&quot;And I&apos;m Miguel.&quot;",
            "Another odd name.",
            "He says, &quot;But he&apos;s a real one, let me tell you. My friend is the best dude you&apos;ll ever meet. I love that guy. You might be here for just a night &mdash; and, look, I know the whole thing about falling in love with a call girl &mdash; but give him a chance, huh? Even if it&apos;s just a booty call thing,&quot; he says.",
            "His hand grazes the table, accidentally casting some black, slender object on the floor. It bounces twice before colliding with something else. I hear a click, and then behind me, a flash of colorful light envelops the room. I gasp when I turn to look, and my heart jumps into my throat.",
            "Behind the bright window, a mother and daughter are screaming at each other. It gives me such a start that I collapse into the couch. The woman is screaming, the daughter is screaming, I&apos;m screaming, and the man is shouting, trying to free himself from my armor.",
            "I spew a string of apologies as the woman in the window says something about wanting her body back, just as all I want is to go home. Too panicked to realize that the best direction is from whence I came, I sprint for the door as the other guy curses, grasping his leg.",
            "I&apos;ll just go around like Cody. We&apos;ll trade places.",
            "Just like my intruder, I trip backwards out the door, scraping the edges of the cement with my plate armor as I slide down the sculpted stairs, coming directly to a stop beneath a blinding torchlight. I scramble to my feet to try and run, but everything is so bright and unfamiliar that I fall to my knees.",
            "The sky is cloudless, but I can&apos;t find a single star. Lake Garrison is nowhere to be found; instead of the distant lights of my hometown of Hillfar, a pattern of white-and-red dotted lights slide past each other on a hill, somewhere far beyond the eaves of two houses on the other side of the road.",
            "Something loud is approaching. I try to curl into a ball to protect myself, but the armor stiffens me too much. A massive automobile tears past, lighting the entire street with headlamps lodged in the front, unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen. It sounds like they have an entire orchestra in there behind the glass, but the deafening music fades . . . only to be replaced by two more loud metal chariots that shake the ground.",
            "I&apos;m quivering as I lay there in the grass, wondering where the garden is; why the lake isn&apos;t directly across from me; why stars shifted in the sky so swiftly. ",
            "An old woman walks on the side of the street, and I consider she&apos;s a lamplighter until I see her holding a leash. She notices me crumpled in the grass on the verge of tears.",
            "&quot;Are you alright, sweetheart?&quot; She asks.",
            "&quot;No,&quot; I cry.",
            "Her familiar crosses the grass, nuzzling me with its wet nose before it licks my face.",
            "&quot;Oh, that&apos;s Doby. She&apos;s real friendly with all the young&apos;uns living around here &mdash; do you mind dogs? Or are you more of a cat person?&quot;",
            "&quot;I&apos;m a human person. A living human&mdash;&quot;",
            "&quot;&mdash;I swear to the good Lord in heaven: if this neighborhood is turning into one of those &apos;college&apos; towns the Facebook talks about, with all these young&apos;uns in their new houses playing trapping music, I&apos;m going to lose it!&quot;",
            "I haven&apos;t the time to protest when I hear a hissing noise, and it sounds like the elder is conjuring a serpent. Before I can react, I feel a cloudless rain, followed by a direct blast of water to my face, saturating the clothes beneath my armor in seconds.",
            "&quot;Why? Why do you torment me?&quot; I plead, my tears now inseparable from the water soaking me down to my underwear. ",
            "&quot;I didn&apos;t set the timer on those sprinklers,&quot; she says, and then adds, &quot;damn beatnik.&quot;",
            "As I kneel in the muddy grass, sullying my new pants, I watch as the cantankerous woman retreats, dragging the mutt alongside her. A single, white moon hangs in the sky. Blinking red and white flashes somewhere even higher, casting smoke in a faint line, leaving the sound of a crackle as it slices the sky. I never knew the sky could be torn. ",
            "With my mind petrified, locking my muscles, resigning me to soak in the jets of water, my body decides for me, urging me back inside to pass Cody&apos;s cursing companion.",
            "All I want is to return to the comfort of Fosroth where the world is uncomplicated. I want a cup of tea and a book beside the fire as I warm my bones. I will never bear witness to this horrifying illusion again.",
            "I ignore his companion&apos;s threat to take shots, though he holds a bottle instead of a gun, &mdash; asking if his friend paid for any more guards to defend this house. But as I stumble towards the closet, squeaking my saturated boots with each step, all I find is another figure, standing there at the back of the closet."

            "I wager my strength and power over his defenses. The inebriated man called Cody holds the odd, metallic broomstick with his hands together in the center &mdash; a technique I&apos;ve never seen before &mdash; and calls out a phrase I can only decipher as a challenge.",
            "If it&apos;s a sword fight he wants, I know I can make it to the greatsword leaning against the wall, because if this Auvryan cross-blood wants to wreak havoc on my home life with his illusions, sullying the most sacred place I have to replenish myself and find respite, then I have no other choice. ",
            "He must be destroyed.",
            "Cody drags his left foot behind him, bending his knees, leaning his body in a forward squat as if that can stop me. Surely this assassin is an Auvryan, and likely some kind of mercenary: their people are masters with pole weapons. But I doubt his technique is greater than the strength of a full-blooded Human flooded with Essence.",
            "I charge with my armored left shoulder, allowing the Essence to flow into my legs, flooding my muscles with such power that every step deflects the floorboards. I close the distance faster than he expects, but he remains steadfast, standing there with the metal broom raised to chest height, hinging his arms to receive the full force of my momentum.",
            "It&apos;s when I&apos;m three steps from deliverance that he bends to get under me &mdash; but my muscle memory is far faster. I lower myself further than he can, sliding beneath the pole, driving my metallic shoulder into his chest and blasting him in the air.",
            "He lets out a rasping wheeze when his ribs bend towards his lungs. He&apos;s lucky that nothing inside him breaks: maybe it&apos;s the alcohol on his breath that hints that his muscles are loose, and that he&apos;s feeling a little braver than he might be otherwise.  Cody crashes against my wall, leaving a sizable divot in the aged wallpaper, and before the ground reclaims him, I manage to snag the greatsword with my left hand, dragging it across the floor to assume a defensive stance. ",
            "Somehow, he still manages to death-grip the broom between his hands, coughing and gasping for air as he lifts himself to his feet, overflowing with adrenaline and rage that radiate in his reddening face.",
            "I realize I left him an opening to escape. I expect him to cower, retreating to his conjured illusion to never return. But he flips the broom end of the stick to face him, exposing a sharp, hollow edge. ",
            "His hapless courage is admirable. Maybe I would have fallen for him if this were training, and we were on the same side of the war.",
            "Cody coughs. &quot;You couldn&apos;t just let me go, could you?&quot;",
            "&quot;I need to be sure you can&apos;t ever ruin my peace again.&quot;",
            "He takes several labored breaths, clutching his chest, swinging the sharp end of the broom in several circles. &quot;So you&apos;re trying to kill me, then?&quot;",
            "&quot;It&apos;s not my fault that you broke in.&quot;",
            "&quot;I was trying to tell you that the door was open. What the hell kind of neighbor are you?&quot;",
            "&quot;You&apos;re not strong enough to be my neighbor,&quot; I tell him.",
            "The ceiling has just enough clearance to swing the greatsword in a vertical slash. I expect this cumbersome move to give him enough of a start to really escape this time, but he still refuses, standing there with the stick between his hands. ",
            "The sword traces a faint line in the wooden ceiling before gravity does the rest of the work. It clashes with the broom &mdash; and I fully expect it to break through &mdash; but all my greatsword does is well a deep notch in the hexagonal shaft.",
            "He mutters something about the material, cursing about how this broom is personal to him, but I know very little of the Auvrya or their traditions. My blade releases sparks when I try to pull it back, grinding against the notch, but the further I pull, the higher the blade climbs. ",
            "I hear the screech of metal-on-metal, and it seems it&apos;s his turn to close the distance. He grinds the pole against the sharp edge, driving the sword higher and higher until it falls behind my hands. I&apos;m left defenseless, and he jabs the plastic head of the stick against my breastplate, driving me to the floor."

            "I lift myself by the counter&apos;s edge to dig my hand into the sink, feeling for the hilt of the dagger. ",
            "&quot;Your fight is with me, not the damn house!&quot; I say.",
            "He bends down to scoop up one of the apples with the stick, taking it into the basket. I level the dagger at him, taking a butcher&apos;s knife in my other hand, completely unsure of what he&apos;s going to do next.",
            "His hands shift to the sharp end of the stick, leaving the basket at a certain length behind him. ",
            "Then he whips it down as hard as he can. ",
            "The apple whizzes past my head, exploding against the stone wall, casting chunks of its sugary flesh and skin into my hair.",
            "&quot;I should have practiced since the club team sophomore year,&quot; he says, slurring his words. &quot;Next one&apos;s going corner-pocket in your damn eye socket.&quot;",
            "&quot;Not if I end you first,&quot; I say.",
            "The assassin scoops up an orange with a single flick of his wrist. I ready the knife block. He launches a second one, but I&apos;m quick enough to slice it with my dagger before it blasts me in the forehead. ",
            "My eyes burn with the citrus, and when I think he&apos;s reeling to throw something harder &mdash; like a pear or another apple &mdash; squinting as I wipe the juice with my dagger hand, I use my unpracticed off hand to flick the kitchen knife through the air.",
            "It spins several times before embedding itself into the wall behind him. He freezes. I set the dagger on the counter, taking three more kitchen knives into my left hand, certain that I can hit dead-center now that my dominant hand is free.",
            "I whip a second one, letting the Essence tension the fibers of my muscles, launching the paring knife faster than an arrow. ",
            "But he&apos;s already pitching up the overturned kitchen table. ",
            "The tablecloth hovers to the floor like melting ectoplasm before the paring knife pins it to the table. Cody lets out a yelp in fear, surely unhurt since the blade is far shallower than the thick mahogany. ",
            "I decide to upgrade to a carving knife, withdrawing all five inches from the block. I judge its balance. ",
            "He peeks from behind the table, and I whip the carving knife where I expect his chest to be, thinking it&apos;s his body that braces the table upright. ",
            "But he bends back. ",
            "It stabs through almost up to the handle.",
            "&quot;Holy hell,&quot; he exclaims.",
            "I wind up to throw another as he pulls the small knife from the wallpaper, then throw it. The boring knife spins through the air, nearly pinning his hand to the wall. He catches me off guard when he emerges from the side of the table. I reach for another culinary weapon, but I realize my offhand is out of blades.",
            "The oddly-dressed assassin flips the blade to set the sharp edge between his fingers, his eyes dark and piercing as he raises his elbow and lifts the knife behind his head. The panic seizes my heart: this assassin&apos;s skilled enough to engage a vetted Royal Guard when he&apos;s two sheets to the wind. I&apos;m certain a knife will soon be in my chest, and all I can do is ready myself for the deliverance of cold steel.",
            "And then he throws it.",
            "I expect it to fly so fast that I can&apos;t catch a glimpse of its glistening edge before it embeds itself between my breastplate. I expect my consciousness to end, to wash in the next fated moment upon the Reservoir of Souls. ",
            "But I can see it.",
            "And it&apos;s not coming at me.",
            "It flies so far to the right that I wonder if he&apos;s aiming at something else. The paring knife spins horizontally through the air, twirling and spinning with such disarray that it only makes it halfway to the kitchen before it clatters against the floor.",
            "&quot;Damn it!&quot; he says.",
            "The laugh escapes before my hands cover my mouth. I can&apos;t even stop the loud snort. His face is crestfallen, even more hurt than the time I rammed him.",
            "&quot;You should stick with that strange basket-stick of yours,&quot; I tell him.",
            "Cody&apos;s voice wavers. &quot;It&apos;s called a lacrosse stick,&quot; he says, blushing hard, peeking over the edge with his glasses as he struggles to withdraw the carving knife from the other side. ",
            "I thought he was an Auvryan mind-flayer &mdash; a mythical master of mental manipulation, maybe commissioned by the Chymaera. But he&apos;s no warrior. Just a stupidly-brave commoner that&apos;s overconfident in his skills. And a complete idiot.",
            "I can&apos;t stop laughing. ",
            "&quot;What are you, some kind of combat janitor? Do you sweep floors with that thing?&quot;",
            "His face reddens further, whether it&apos;s the booze, his humiliation, or both.  I feel the relief wash over me as the Essence retreats from my circuits. ",
            "&quot;Gods above, for a second I thought you were an actual threat,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Who says I&apos;m not?&quot; He scoops a tomato into the &apos;cross stick&apos;, poised to whip another one.",
            "&quot;Just . . . stop,&quot; I tell him. &quot;I&apos;m not going to kill a civilian.&quot;",
            "&quot;Maybe you should reconsider,&quot; he says.",
            "&quot;Consider this.&quot;",
            "I raise my hands and cast a controlled plume of flames. He flinches when they stop only inches from his face, dropping something hard and small from his pocket. He has to steady himself with the odd weapon as he stumbles towards the closet.",
            "&quot;Really, Cody. Do you even understand our training? How much Essence a Royal Guard is conditioned with? How much mead does it take to get this kind of courage? I could snap your bones with my hands!&quot;",
            "&quot;I&apos;m your neighbor. I live right next door . . . through there,&quot; he says, lifting a bare arm exposed by his scalded shirt to point towards the closet. ",
            "&quot;Why are you living in the military district?&quot;",
            "&quot;I live in Hearthland Ridge,&quot; he insists. &quot;The military base is down in Cheyenne, or maybe Fort Carson.&quot;",
            "&quot;This is Gaffesend,&quot; I tell him.",
            "&quot;No, this is Colorado. The United States,&quot; he says.",
            "&quot;Nothing is united in all of Fosroth. You can&apos;t be stupid enough to be a tourist at the war front!&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;The war is overseas. It&apos;s fought with drones and bombs.&quot;",
            "&quot;It&apos;s waged with swords and rifles!&quot;",
            "I approach him until I can smell the booze on his breath. My eyes flutter between his exposed chest and his arms, a little impressed at his definition when he obviously has no Essence. I catch him glimpsing at my bare thighs that once straddled him, and then to my breastplate, before returning my glare and slowly backing up towards the closet.",
            "But his heels catch on the threshold.",
            "He falls through the portal, unable to steady himself with his weapon before he crashes to the ground on the other side. I take one more glance at the horrors of that incomprehensible world: all its glistening, colored lights like Essenced lightning bugs. The fear forestalls me from passing that threshold ever again, so I stand there: watching; waiting; listening to the faintness of his breath; until I&apos;m certain his intemperance will keep him there.",
            "But the fear of that other world overpowers my penchant for patience. I slam the door behind him, certain I&apos;ll never have to face that stranger again."

And after relieving myself, I found my phone on the counter with three unread texts:",

            "Thanks for cleaning up dude, you didn&apos;t have to do that! Let&apos;s chill next weekend. Not much else to do when everyone moved away :/",
            "Feeling disgusting, I rushed upstairs to take a shower, getting off the sweat and stench of a failed all-nigher. My shower thoughts brought me back to that dream in another world: getting slashed by a crazy roleplayer and encountering strangers in some semi-modern renaissance world. I looked down at my left hand, as if the warm shower water wasn&apos;t enough to tell me whether or not the flesh parted like a bad haircut. But all I found was smooth skin. ",
            "It must have been a shared dream, like Inception, because I still don&apos;t recall inviting anyone over: hell, I don&apos;t even know who to call. But as the scalding water relieves the pounding in my head, I find that all I can think of is the magical woman I fought in my dreams, how she straddled me, threw knives at me, and cleaved that heavy greatsword straight into the middle of my lacrosse stick. ",
            "I dried myself off before a different kind of pleasure could emerge from those thoughts: I was more absorbed by the strangeness of that vivid and continuous dream. My curiosity led me to try opening the door to the closet, finding another door behind it that looked as if its handle were blasted with a blowtorch. ",
            "I just assumed I&apos;d forgotten there was no closet. Were these pre-builds originally intended for a hotel chain or something with the neighbor door? It didn&apos;t make sense at all, but I knew I wouldn&apos;t feel safe, and I was actively looking for any kind of excuse to make something stupid in my robotics workshop. ",

With a spare microcontroller, I hooked up a hall-effect sensor and a buzzer &mdash; a magnet sensor and a loud speaker, basically &mdash; to detect if that door was ever to move. By soldering the wires to the breadboard, along with some AA batteries, and using generous dollops of hot glue to stick it to the inside wall of the strange-looking door, I called it a day around 9:30 PM, returning to my bed for an early night of sleep so I could get up tomorrow, only to spend four hours doom-scrolling through the week&apos;s sordid politics.

The shorter the time between those moments of frantic stillness, the easier it slides into that incontrovertible state of shock. It&apos;s addiction without a pleasure to be addicted to, and the more often that white feeling haunts me, the stronger it gets &mdash; so I&apos;m glad when I find my effects are still scattered across the floor. A mess to clean is the second-best thing to distract me right now: the first is going to the bar, but after my episode, I&apos;d rather not be seen in public.",

I pull the kitchen knives from the overturned table and reset the tablecloth the other way around, covering the gaping holes in the wood. Finding the evidence is still in the fabric, I sew the clean cuts in the tablecloth closed with thread from my sewing kit. I mop and dab all the puddles and smudges. This leads to finding places for the hundred pounds of my unpacked personal items, placing them anywhere but the closet I should have forgotten, which leads to re-orienting all the decorations and furniture and bookshelf to make the space my own, which leads to dusting every surface I can find.

I walk with Oriya, Jullian, Berry, and Ryder every morning for five of them, to take new postings from the quest board and get to work. Every sixth or so, I persuade them to join me on a hike or go swimming in the hot springs.

Besides walking to work hand-in-hand, we&apos;ve gotten together almost every day off to blow off some steam. I&apos;ve only been able to convince him once to go on a date with me to the hot springs, and it was on my earnings. The other times he says he&apos;s too busy &mdash; though I always see him with his friends. It disappoints me when our acts of passion end as soon as he gets off: the only courtesy he seems to have is letting me get there first.",

It feels like a festival, the way all the street lamps are adorned with fresh flowers; the businesses shuttered for an hour; and the full population split between halves of the street. We stand in pattern between the onlookers and the empty road. The senior guards are busy on the city outskirts, demanding papers, and ensuring no Chymaeran spies are guising unwitting villagers. We hold the ceremonial rifles that we retrieved from the armory, clasped between our hands and upright, though Aldrin insists we &quot;can&apos;t be fully trusted with them yet,&quot; and that we need to &quot;train with a blade before we can handle them.&quot;",
            "My eyes steady on the vacancy in front of me on the other side of the road, originally intended to be held by Bertram. Before long, the shimmering white carriage prattles down the road, drawn by two black horses. They&apos;re looking to have a two-nights&apos;-stay in the hot springs, and we&apos;re meant to prove to them that Gaffesend is safe, encouraging more tourists to make the trek to enrich our lands.",
            "I figure most of our population is excited for the presence of a Chosen Mask: we got the news that he was being paid to defend the carriage between villages. It&apos;s rare that anyone notable ever passes through, especially since we&apos;re the last stop before nothing. I can see him waving to his admirers from the coachman&apos;s seat as they cheer and throw flowers at the feet of the horses. Within the carriage, a finely-dressed family of six waves from the windows, wearing white and gold.",
            "I feel my hands loosen their tension on the rifle. The nagging feeling of fear that&apos;s plagued me since forever is almost in the back seat, and around me, I can drink to the exuberance of the town. To my left, Naya smiles, predictably not the type to cheer. To my right, Pax pumps his fist in the air. And Bertram is absolutely focused on the royals, standing there directly in front of me.",
            "The carriage is drawing closer, at least a hundred paces away. Some of the family&apos;s younger passengers have exited the carriage, walking alongside the road and tossing wrapped candies to the onlookers. The nagging feeling grows stronger. It&apos;s just too peaceful. And as my hands tension around the black steel, Bertram&apos;s eyes catch a glint of amethyst when he decides to make his move."

         "Chapter 10 Scene 4": [
            "They&apos;re close enough to run me over, but my body&apos;s trained to react before I can think. Muscle memory comes before thought, thought before fear, and fear before true reaction, so it&apos;s only when I&apos;m halfway across the road that the thoughts finally reach my muscles. The others are only beginning to notice when the Chymaeran fleshwalker raises the rifle. I&apos;m the only one that happened to know enough and be close enough to respond, and when I try to take another step, I feel the gravity of my past flood my veins with molasses.",
            "I struggle to refuse the defenses of my own mind. I always swear I can taste the smoke from that fire when my heartbeat rises. And as the Chymaeran assassin guising my friend prepares to take aim and pull the trigger, all I can do is watch as I collapse to the street, giving the horses such a start that they shy and snort, rearing on their hind legs, casting the carriage forwards and backwards.",
            "Pax is quick on the uptake: for every dearth of common sense, he excels in his perception, tuned to that energy of the attacker. While the other junior guards only begin to notice, and the Chosen is left helpless in a battle of speed, the assassin pulls the trigger, spooking the horses and the spectators as Pax tackles him to the ground.",
            "I brace my head with my cheek brushing moss between the roadway stones. The coachman pulls the slip knot, and the horses&apos; hooves clatter against the road, and I hold my breath, as if it could change the chances of the startled stallions shattering my spine or ribs. But they clamber right overhead, and as the carriage passes directly over my prostrated body lying straight with the road, I feel the wetness of something dense drip across my cheek.",
            "My ears still ring from the blast, but I can hear the cries of the children and the wife. And when I&apos;m sure my whole body can still respond to its commands, I begin to crawl from beneath the carriage.",
            "&quot;May the gods damn your pathetic town and its useless guards,&quot; the wife says. &quot;It should be wiped off the face of the map!&quot;",
            "I begin to imagine the repercussions, and I try to prepare myself for what&apos;s to come. I accept my fate to vanish from this program. I had my chance, and yet I couldn&apos;t even finish the job!",
            "The Chosen drags me out from beneath the carriage with his gloved hands. A long streak of the husband&apos;s blood stains my bangs and trickles down my nose. When I look to the inside of the white carriage, emptied of its crying inhabitants and bright with a splatter of red, I find the husband taking shallow breaths as he holds his shoulder, tended to by the glowing hands of their family&apos;s hired healer.",
            "The immaculately-dressed wife&apos;s jewelry clatters when she gets her hands around my collar, thrashing me as the Chosen hesitates to disarm his source of wealth. Her hands are already red with her lover&apos;s blood, clothes absent the pristine ivory white they surely struggled to sustain on such sultry trails.",
            "&quot;You cowering, yellow-bellied bitch,&quot; she exclaims. Her gloved hand batters my cheek with deafening leather contact. &quot;You leach our tribute. You live to give your lives for us, and I&apos;ll be sure you don&apos;t see another sunrise in this line of work. The guard of this backwater town are a joke!&quot;",
            "I can feel my tears streaming, directly in the view of all my comrades that can only just stand there and watch. Jullian ducks his head when I meet his eyes. Naya freezes, her tail frayed. And Ryder and Pax are busy wrestling the Chymaeran as it tries to change forms. ",
            "But I hear the husband. &quot;Dear. That young guard is the reason my head is on my shoulders. I mean, Gods, if she hadn&apos;t given the horses a start...&quot;",
            "&quot;She nearly got you killed!&quot;",
            "&quot;The bullet did that,&quot; he says.",
            "&quot;But still,&quot; she says. The mercurial woman releases my collar and tensions her fists, letting out an exasperated cry. The side of my face aches as I slouch, wiping my tears with the unsullied parts of my arms, remembering not to dirty their carriage with contact from my body.",
            "But it&apos;s the distress of the children that damages me the most. Standing on the other side of their life-altering trauma, facing such failure that I&apos;m painted with the aggressor, the devastating shock registers on their faces, now devoid of sorrow, just speechless like I once was as they try to recalibrate their understanding of how horrifying the world can be. And all I want is to embrace them, to tell them that everything will be alright, to let them cry into my shoulder.",
            "&quot;You failed us. And you&apos;re going to pay for this,&quot; the wife screams at Aldrin when he approaches. &quot;How are you going to make this right?&quot;",
            "&quot;You&apos;ll make it right by apologizing to my officer,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t care how much money you have, what role you play in the Empire, you will apologize for assaulting the woman who tried to save you!&quot;",
            "&quot;And failed,&quot; she insists. &quot;You&apos;re messing with Valensend blood&mdash;&quot;",
            "&quot;You gave two days of warning for your arrival, refusing like all you rich types do to pay in advance, and then you have the gall to say we didn&apos;t prepare. It takes weeks!&quot;",
            "The woman tensions her fists. Two of children grasp her dress by the fabric. I draw deep breaths to make the blood flow back into my fingers and legs, all the while feeling like I&apos;m stealing a resource I no longer deserve.",
            "But I hear the father&apos;s voice behind me. &quot;She would have complained the same if it was just a scare: I would have stopped her if I had the strength. As far as I&apos;m concerned, you saved my life.&quot;",
            "&quot;But I hesitated. I saved no one. It was luck.&quot;",
            "&quot;Luck or not, you&apos;re a reason my children still have a father,&quot; he says. I turn around. He gestures for the servant and the healer to tend to my scratches, and with a quick wave of a hand, I feel the sting slowly dissipate from my face.",
            "He reaches from the open door, dabbing his blood from my skin with a clean corner of a towel, ensuring that nothing ill will come of this. Behind us, the two continue to argue as senior guards apprehend the battered Chymaeran assassin. It&apos;s only when I see the assailant&apos;s guise of my cherished friend that I remember the absence of the real one.",
            "I release an unintelligible string of words before the panic peaks inside me once again. Aldrin shouts. Two of my friends try to stop me, and the woman screams of my cowardice, but all I can think of is what I learned it takes for a Chymaeran to steal a guise.",
            "I run as fast as my feet will take me, choosing to try and save another, even if it means damnation for leaving this all behind."

I&apos;ve spent so many hours imagining how I would boost the performance if IT gave me a blank check, and I was the bottleneck. Although a workstation laptop is nice to take home, it has nothing over one of those stationary rigs that the Robinson-Monroe lifers were grandfathered into.",
            "They gave me the laptop two years ago, and it hasn&apos;t been updated since. One day I booted into BIOS to see if I could overclock it, or take it to its limits. But IT&apos;s Great Wall of Control knows no bounds, so all I can do is sit here for twenty minutes at a time before I notice the changes in the drawing are applied.",
            "Those twenty minutes are silent. Only Wilbur and I sit in the row, and we&apos;re not even across from each other. Reed filled in the spot that the last escapee left behind, and although I was eager for months to move next to Kei and take the next steps, Navesh insisted it was a &quot;major waste of time.&quot; I feel like Wilbur and I have exhausted every topic across the generational gap: his kids, when I plan to marry, if I have a serious girlfriend yet, cars, and sports. Every day I hear his wake apnea over the partitions, and sometimes I wonder if it&apos;s the perfect cover for him to be sleeping.",
            "The computer still holds an hourglass. It&apos;s midday, and the neighboring row is filled with chatter. I hear Reed&apos;s voice the most often, and a little too often: if golden retrievers could design and code, and the connotation didn&apos;t imply he was stupid, I think it would fit him well. Kei acknowledges his musings here and there, but is always so focused that she spits no more than a couple words.",
            "I check the calendar in the lower right corner of my screen. Fall is fast approaching, and when I count, it&apos;s been almost four weeks since I moved in. Four weekends of my parents coming over to visit, bringing over one of my favorite home-cooked meals, allowing them to ask when they&apos;ll have grandkids now that I have a house. Four weeks since I lost my brother&apos;s classic IPod, so now I listen to music on my phone. But also four weeks without drinking: most days I just go home, spend an hour on the computer scrolling my list of games, trying to convince myself to play something, and then go to sleep early unless I go to the gym with Miguel.",

The longer time drags, and the later into my twenties it gets, the further I feel from the spurious passion of those college years where it was forced out of me. It&apos;s like being at the bottom of a dark pool, or a distant game of telephone recalling how I last recalled those moments. My vocal cords feel neglected for how little use they get, and like an unmotivated violinist, I&apos;ve been unpracticed for a while.",

            "We pass the market street, then sprint along the road at the edge of the lake. I collect speed with distance, and by the time we arrive at Bertram&apos;s gate, I leverage all my Essence and anger against his door, bashing my armored shoulder against the painted wood.",
            "The door splits in splintered halves. The dust and sawdust coalesce in dark, floating motes as the sun casts ribbons of light through the entryway, and I squint my eyes to adjust to the darkness of his house. There is not a sound to tell his whereabouts. We enter the kitchen to find the window ajar with the curtains fluttering, the same window I use to trade for breakfast.",
            "&quot;He&apos;s not on the bottom floor,&quot; I say. It&apos;s just a single, long room that mixes the kitchen with a living space and dining area. None of the chairs are overturned, and the mess looks average for a single man.",

            "&quot;Drained?&quot; I ask.",
            "&quot;The blood,&quot; Pax says. &quot;For a short guise like this that doesn&apos;t take a pound of flesh, it evaporates from his body every minute, damaging his organs. He&apos;ll wish he lost a finger instead.&quot;",
            "&quot;We need to heal him right away,&quot; I say, extending my hands, but Pax stops me.",
            "&quot;Human Essence will only make this worse. It&apos;s like treating frostburn with warm water.&quot;",
            "&quot;Then what do we do?&quot; I ask.",
            "&quot;There&apos;s medicine at the base, but it&apos;s really up to him until we can get him there. He&apos;s got to fight,&quot; Pax says. &quot;The worst is over, but I only know l as far as experimenting with my Chymaeran blood has gotten me. I&apos;ll still monitor the Curse.&quot;",
            "&quot;And I&apos;ll carry him,&quot; Ryder says.",
            "&quot;We need to keep him warm,&quot; I say. He&apos;s sweating so profusely, but I tuck the sheets around him, feeling his flesh is colder than ice. I press my head to his chest, listening to his faint heartbeat. &quot;It&apos;s my turn to save you,&quot; I tell him, standing back as Ryder works to position him across the back of his shoulders.",
            "Beyond his window, the curious villagers and guards begin to gather, and I pray that Aldrin will have the understanding. I follow Pax and Ryder to the gates of the base on the route of our daily walk, using Essence to help sustain his warmth beneath the blanket."

            "It&apos;s the fact that the last four weeks passed so peacefully. I thought this was all just a dream after that drunken night with Miguel, but the beautiful girl I mistook for a cosplayer chokes on her tears between breaths as she buries her face into my arm.",

And&mdash;and you piss me off a little, but not that much,&quot; I say, trying to balance the resurgent feelings of vice with a desire for goodwill.",

            "The entire weight of the armored torso lands on my face when I crash to the floor. My hands cup the meager metal chest contours of modified men&apos;s armor, weighing against my face and smelling of sweat as if I were stuck in a scrum of lacrosse players.",
            "But I can hear her breathe easier without the burden of all that cosplay gear. Her breathless panic makes even more sense when I rid my face of the breastplate, discovering how much she has to contort herself just to fit into the damn thing.",
            "She removes the last of her bindings, far tighter than the &quot;combat corset&quot; that constrains her waist. She pulls at the fabric of the undershirt to circulate air, where two large sweat spots accentuate the shape of her chest.",
            "Her face and golden eyes alone could get a zoomer to watch her stream Excel spreadsheets: if she ditched the immersive armor and went for something less practical, she could be living in a mansion!",

Crescents dig beneath her eyes, and as she still works at slowing her breaths &mdash; muttering to herself something about &quot;where she is&quot; &mdash; I can see how tired this whole ordeal has made her, and my feelings of malice slip away.",
            "She sits with her head in her hands, tensioning her fingers around her scalp. I&apos;d offer her a hug if I didn&apos;t think she still hated me, so instead, I decide to warm her with something else.",

            "&quot;Yo, chill! Chill out. Look,&quot; he says, showing me a brightly-lit device with far more little colored squares than the music box. A cartoon of an automobile is on the screen, dancing around the center of a map. &quot;You don&apos;t have to stab first and ask questions later, soldier girl.&quot;",

            "He cracks the door. I rise to my feet and find the footing to attack, but when the door opens, some bearded guy with earrings and fancy glasses hands a bag to him. Cody mutters some question about whether the tip of something is in an app, and then he nods, allowing him to close the door, and when I catch a glimpse of the scene beyond the door, I realize again that it looks nothing like Gaffesend.",
            "I rush to the window, throwing open the shades. &quot;Where is this? Where are you? And where&apos;s the lake?&quot; I ask. I begin to think it&apos;s all a ruse to trap me at my weakest.",

            "Before he can hand me something from the bag, I race back across the threshold of my door, only to find my world the same way I left it. From my window, Gaffesend is abuzz with the week&apos;s end sight of commoners strolling on the cobblestone streets.",
            "&quot;Katiya,&quot; Cody calls. &quot;Do you want your tacos or not?&quot;",
            "&quot;Cody,&quot; I say. &quot;This is...&quot;",
            "He crosses the threshold of the door, finding the same sight he must have thought was just a dream. Now he rushes to my window, watching the water reflect in the light of an early-morning sun.",
            "I&apos;m glad he put the bag down in the other world. He clutches his chest, short of breath, and I think the man of science is finally beginning to understand that the world is not as measurable as he thinks.",
            "His face flushes white as if he&apos;s seen a Chymaeran fleshwalker. I have to catch him before he falls, and I grab him by the space between his arms.",
            "&quot;You weren&apos;t &mdash; you mean that&mdash;&quot; Cody tries to struggle from my grasp to walk out my front door for the first time by his own volition, but his clothes are far too strange: they might think he&apos;s a Chymaeran spy, or ask his noble heritage.",
            "&quot;Stop resisting,&quot; I command, hugging him to my chest. I realize I&apos;m speaking my own tongue now, and he&apos;s speaking mine, and I say, &quot;seriously, can you stop fighting me when I&apos;m trying to help you?&quot;",

            "&quot;A four-stroke engine that runs on dead dinosaurs.&quot; I don&apos;t catch the meaning of the last word, but my mind associates it with creatures from an eternity ago. He clarifies. &quot;Gasoline. Hydrocarbons from crude oil.&quot;",

That I can&apos;t possibly get hurt, regardless of how fast we go. That anything foreign and strange and big and too impossibly smooth is there for a reason, and that nothing is going wrong unless he says it is, and that he&apos;ll surely bring it up if things are even slightly bad.",
            "He doesn&apos;t press the glowing switch on the wall for a reason, facing the large metal door that looks like it isn&apos;t supposed to open from the sides. The automobile is so smooth and metallic: shinier than my greatsword, and probably one of the shiny things he told me not to touch.",
            "But he instructs me to enter. Then he looks down at my feet and realizes I&apos;m wearing steel boots, and demands more of me, telling me to lace up a pair of his &quot;trainers&quot; though they look nothing like shoes of war.",

And then he presses a button on a wide mirror that opens the door to this car room: sounding off with a loud rumble of a generator that nearly sets me into panic.",
            "He reassures me that it&apos;s all okay. But then something flashes on his automobile&apos;s front thing about blue teeth being connected, and I hear the loudest sound I&apos;ve ever heard: one that gives me such a start that I notice it gives him a start, and according to his original rules, that means that I should panic.",
            "His hand slams against the circular knob as I almost drive my fist against the glowing screen, but he deflects my hand just in time. He wags his finger several times at me before pulling out his cellular telephone to change something, saying that music about metal is probably too much for me, that he was just at the gym.",
            "I ask him what they&apos;re yelling about. He says he doesn&apos;t really know, but that it gets him &quot;amped&quot; at the gymnasium, and chooses some other thing that tells the sonograph to play another tune.",
            "He backs out of the space slowly. His eyes flicker between my face and the edge of the car port that&apos;s close to the metal door, and I nearly slam my head against the front with the sudden change in inertia.",
            "He presses his left arm against my shoulders, telling me to relax. And when he&apos;s beginning to second-guess himself of this whole plan, saying that he&apos;s only &quot;adding fuel to the fire that is my anxiety,&quot; and that I&apos;m never going to relax at this rate.",
            "I tell him I&apos;m not made to relax, and that I&apos;ve faced worse than his soft world with all these rounded edges could ever throw at him.",
            "So we back out of the driveway. I tense my legs and feet against the bottom of the car to make sure my back is always against the soft chair, and when he makes his first full quarter-turn backwards into the street, something closes the big steel door.",
            "He asks if I&apos;m alright. I ask if he&apos;s going to stop asking if I&apos;m alright, and when my eyes look up from my legs to take in the view beyond the warped front glass, I see a marvel of architecture in front of my eyes.",
            "It&apos;s like the town of Gaffesend with all its row-houses, but cleaner and sharper. There are children here that play in the street: the young ones at least, the older ones sit in the corners on telephones like the one that Cody has, laughing at something as they share it with each other. One man sprays a dedicated stream of water from a hose to wet his plants. There are so many other cars that sit all across the road: behind the car garages, on the streets off to the side, so many that I wonder if they have cars this comfortable, why they would need a house in the first place. ",
            "I wonder aloud. It makes Cody laugh pretty hard, and he manages to collect himself by the first red octagon with the words STOP written across it.",
            "I don&apos;t allow the inertia to surprise me this time. But the right turn does, and I lean so far into Cody that I have to stabilize myself by grabbing his right leg, causing him to slam the brake and throw himself forward.",
            "He barks at me, but without bite, gesturing to a handle attached to the top edge of the car, something he calls the &quot;oh-shit handle,&quot; insisting I grab it until I get my bearing. Several seconds later, he changes his mind and tells me not to, afraid I might rip it off the roof.",
            "But I&apos;m too amazed by the sights to tense my body for any turns. When the view of houses opens up after a couple turns, and the musical automobile climbs a slight hill, I catch a fuller view of the city: spanning so far that my eyes can&apos;t count the number of buildings. Not a single stretch of farmland is anywhere: just buildings erected from the colors of nature around them; shiny points of light that shimmer in the mountains; large balloons of color with people in them that hover above the lake.",
            "&quot;And none of this is Essence,&quot; I ask. ",
            "And Cody nods with ease.",
            "My mind doesn&apos;t even know what to process from what my eyes observe, like the late-night lectures in school when all the cadets are too tired to retain anything. My chest stirs with an animated lightness unlike anything I think I&apos;ve ever felt before, except maybe when I was a young child, and although it scares me &mdash; and it&apos;s probably a little from Cody as the operator &mdash; I feel an odd calmness when I&apos;m next to him, listening to the faint voice he tries to hide when he sings the words to the songs he likes.",
            "The cabin is pleasantly cool despite how hot it might be out there. He gestures to a part of the car that shows a number that resembles the temperature, instead of a thermometer.",
            "I bring my head close to the air conditioning. He asks if I really want to have my hair blown, and lowers the window, filling the space with a deafening gust of air until he lowers his window, telling me to reach my hand beyond the cabin.",
            "We race so fast that the air floods through my fingers like water in a stream, and I realize I&apos;m laughing, but I don&apos;t stop myself too much. We get on the highway, and though he&apos;s apprehensive of whether I&apos;ll try to slice the seat belt and jump out the window, I find it amazing: thrilling that any person could have such an ease of access to the sensation of speed.",
            "There are so many other people of this world inside these cars that I wave at them, but Cody tells me not to. He then demands that I &quot;don&apos;t speak to anyone yet&quot; and &quot;don&apos;t call anything anything to anyone&quot; and to &quot;mask my surprise a little&quot; when we get to our destination.",
            "We get off the highway and end up on slower and smaller roads for a while, stopping at crossroads where some light operator tells us when we can drive. One fellow blares his horn really loud, enough to anger Cody to use some gesture on him, speaking words I can&apos;t yet fully understand, but he calms down when he remembers that I&apos;m here, saying he &quot;forgot that I could smite them.&quot;",
            "We end up on a wide square of painted lines in organized rows. Cody stops the automobile between two pairs of them, between two other cars, and instructs me to CAREFULLY! open the car door and not touch the other car door next to me.",
            "I step out into the space between cars, my stomach a little twisted, but my body feeling light. He gestures to a big building with a word that doesn&apos;t translate, because he says it&apos;s a company called Costco, and that they have more stuff to eat and wear and buy than I could ever imagine.",
            "I can feel a hint of the panic set in when I realize I&apos;m surrounded by other commoners of his world for the first time. I&apos;d retreat back into the car if Cody didn&apos;t coax me out by gently grabbing my shirt, telling me that if I stick with him, I&apos;ll be fine.",
            "He offers his hand to me, and I hesitate. But right when I&apos;m about to take it, he pulls away, apologizing, saying that I can walk right next to him.",
            "He points to a row of metal baskets, telling me to grab one. I lift it by the side. His face flushes in secondhand embarrassment when he shows me that there are wheels on the bottom for a reason, and though the wheels are halfway to my waist, I drop the cart as people stare.",
            "He says it&apos;s fine, drawing into his pockets for a small card with patterned lines on it, saying something about hot dogs and some guy that raises them for cheap, instructing me to push the cart as we enter the big warehouse, making sure that I don&apos;t make eye contact with anyone."

I liked designing things. But it was when something happened to me &mdash; or to someone in my family, I guess &mdash; that really made me chase it.&quot; I look at the 3D-printed mini model on my desk that I made to show my brother all those years ago.

            "The rest of the day passes slowly when everybody else is gone: everybody besides Kei and I. The lifers leave early: forced to come in when it&apos;s still dark out so they can take care of their teenagers &mdash; or if they don&apos;t have kids, maybe drink at the bar or something. The young type-A engineers leave a little after so they can make the most of summer&apos;s long evenings, whether it&apos;s running or biking  out on the trails in the open fields between the housing developments, or finding the motivation somewhere to run a load of laundry.",
            "Then Nav leaves, and Reed and Kei say goodbye to him. Then Reed tries to talk to Kei, the only one left in the section, who responds with short yes-and-no answers unless he throws a free-response question at her. Then Reed drags a bunch of virtual cards around his computer, playing Solitaire for almost an hour until he can clock out half an hour longer than eight hours. Then he says goodbye to Kei, then it&apos;s absolutely silent for an hour beyond Kei&apos;s mouse clicks, and when 5:00 rolls around, I shoulder my bag and wave goodbye to the workaholic girl I have a crush on, reminding her that there&apos;s still a world out there.",
            "But this time, it felt different. And it&apos;s consistently felt a little different. Maybe Dad is right that I&apos;ve changed, because instead of leaving the long dragging hours of boredom to find respite in inaction, there&apos;s a part of me that wonders what&apos;s happening on the other side of the door.",
            "But it isn&apos;t much, and ever since I photocopied the rule sheet that Katiya and I wrote up, the first and last rule catch my eye every time I reach to open the door. Maybe it&apos;s just the prospect of that mystical threshold that fills me with excitement. Maybe it&apos;s the images and feelings she&apos;s left me with that I still fight like hell to resist. Or maybe it&apos;s fear of what could happen, overriding the boredom of modern life that comes when you get on the other side of adolescence.",
            "The house is silent when I pull in: the garage door groans as its panels screech back in place. Sometimes I imagine finding her sitting there with a bag of my chips in her combat armor, watching Netflix, but she&apos;s been so busy the last week or so, and even though I haven&apos;t found a reason to unlock my side of the door since we last went for that run, I feel the urge to let in a chance for something to happen."

Earlier than the sun: early enough that the morning hours mask my presence while I wear the hood of my uniform, tucking my golden locks of braided hair beneath the fabric.",

            "So it&apos;s no surprise when the cover of dusk no longer hides me. I hear their whispers when I pass &mdash; or maybe half the time I think I hear them &mdash; calling me &quot;choke&quot; and making a gagging motion, or asking again why I even bothered, some even saying I&apos;d be better suited &quot;for the shady brothels where I could at least be paid to choke on something.&quot; Gossip is easy. Giving up is easy, too: but when I feel the weight of the house key in my pocket, trying to estimate how much heavier it was before the first cadet failed their trials, I remember the other choice is death, and it&apos;s a much stronger wind in my sails than whatever storm these troglodytes can throw at me.",

It&apos;s the first day I&apos;ve decided to visit him, because for the last two weeks, I&apos;ve rued the thought of leaving the infirmary to face their ridicule in broad daylight, though none of them have ever faced anything close to what I&apos;ve fought.",

The medic said my organs would start shutting down, one by one, if you arrived any later.&quot;",

Between the gravel lot outside and the brutal concrete walls, it feels more like a prison infirmary than anything else. &quot;I think I&apos;d get sicker just by staying in this room,&quot; I say. &quot;Do you get to walk around outside, at least?&quot;",

            "He rummages under his bed. &quot;Well, it might have been a while ago, but I think I can be the first,&quot; he says. I hear the clatter of glass as he tears through his meager possessions that they let him hold on to. A drawing of the two of us floats across the floor, and I recognize the artistry from my father.",

            "He blushes: the first sign of life I&apos;ve seen on his pallid face as he holds two bottles. &quot;Just remembering the ones that got me through it,&quot; he says, and then he hands me one. &quot;Ryder and Pax and Naya came by last week. They smuggled in a six-pack, so we had four of them. But I saved two for the day you came back.&quot;",
            "I laugh, looking around cautiously as I grasp the neck of the bottle. The Essenced heat of my hands heats the metal cap enough for it to expand, popping off with a light thunk, and we cheers over half-a-success and half-a-failure. ",

            "&quot;I understand that fear completely,&quot; I say, as I sit beside him. &quot;The world is so random and chaotic, sometimes it makes you wonder if the Gods stopped watching a long time ago. But you&apos;ve been blessed with more time.&quot;",

And all I want to do is run.&quot;",

His gauntlets grasp the side of my head, tracing his thumb on my cheek. &quot;I&apos;ve always hated this weakness I&apos;ve felt my entire life. This cowardice, of a boy that never made friends, made fun of, and was so scared and unchallenged that he never tried to fly.&quot; He tears up a little. &quot;And I guess I&apos;ve taken for granted the one thing I&apos;ve thought I would always have, supporting me through it all.

            "The energy cycles through my body from my arms to my legs, and though my blood freezes with the initial surge of panic, my circuits are scalding with power. The vibrations in the tether rattle the bones in my arms, casting sparks of hot iron, and when I&apos;m close enough to drop and run, I use the force of the fall to dig the toe of my boots between cobblestones. And with all the energy I&apos;ve stored from letting the blood pool in my legs for four hours&mdash;sitting in tight, padded pants&mdash;all I want to do is run.",

Her boots splash in the murky water, crunching the bones of forgotten skeletons that fought the front lines  five hundred years ago. When I land in the calf-high sludge, I cast a plume of fire that bounces between the walls, lighting the lines of the long earthen tomb until it sizzles in the water, just long enough to see her silhouette shrink down the straightaway.",

She scales the stairs of the main edifice, and I wonder why she gains height when it only means she&apos;s getting further from the ground.",

            "I take two steps at a time, casting sparks as my steel pauldtons scrape the side of the stairwell. I can hear her footfalls directly above me as we get higher and higher and higher, until we reach the very top. ",
            "She&apos;s running out of avenues to escape. All that&apos;s left are the buildings of the old industrial district that border the castle, and when we&apos;re four stories up, running across ramparts that look out to a stark cliffside bordering the forest, I doubt she has anywhere to go.",
            "But then she jumps onto a roof of a wooden building in the servants&apos; quarter. She yelps when her foot crashes through the ceiling, withdrawing as I decide to approach from the other side, aiming for the central beam of the frame instead of the eaves.",
            "We&apos;re neck-and-neck as she lumbers with the stolen tool and I struggle with my armor, not quite in grabbing distance when the fall is too much of a consequence. She&apos;s heading for the other side of the castle rampart bordering the industrial warehouses, and when I think I&apos;m about to grab her, she channels all her Essence into accelerating for one final sprint.",
            "My breath tastes like poison when it leaves my lungs. Falling further behind, I watch as she runs directly for the edge of the castle wall, as if to jump to her death. But without hesitation, she clambers onto a straightaway of stone slabs, managing seven strides before she launches herself over the edge.",
            "She vanishes from sight. And I wager she&apos;s planned this all from the start: planning to live and steal another day, so before the hesitation seizes my muscles, I take the same seven steps and launch myself over the edge.",
            "I can feel the turbulence of wind as gravity comes to collect on my four-story climb. Behind me, I hear Jullian cry my name, and beneath me, a yawning gap spans a thousand years of progress between the old castle and the tall industrial building.",
            "We float in the air at the same time, flying like the Auvryan angels of their floating lands. Her Ahkvan reflexes give her just shy of nine lives to land. I hinge my legs in anticipation of crashing into the gravel roof, and after she rolls off her fall, I thrust myself with a plume of flames to break my speed enough to twist myself into a barrel roll.",
            "The roof is small, high, and flat, surrounded by the stark eaves of industrial buildings that are unnavigable. Out of breath, she rushes for the roof access door, only to find it locked, desperately jimmying the round handle as she groans in exasperation.",
            "&quot;Drop it, Rayna,&quot; I tell her.",
            "She complies, placing the artifact on the ground. &quot;As soon as I failed that test, I was always destined to die. So do whatever you have to do with me.&quot;",
            "I quickly glance to the edge of the castle wall, so much higher than I remember. All the guards descended the stairs, running around to reconvene inside the warehouse. And I make a decision. ",
            "I reach past her, tensioning my fingers against the knob as it glows with scalding heat.",
            "&quot;What are you doing? But aren&apos;t you going to take me in? I&apos;m a part of the Den Of Thieves now!&quot;",
            "&quot;You and I aren&apos;t that different. Just separated by time, I fear.&quot; I gesture for the door, quoting the report I&apos;ll write later. &quot;She got away. But she dropped the high-value tool she might have used to aid the enemy.&quot;",
            "A look of shameful relief flushes her face. Sweat mixes with tears she refuses to allow to break the threshold of her eyes. &quot;I never wanted it to end up this way,&quot; she says. &quot;Aren&apos;t you afraid they&apos;ll send you to die? And then what will you do?&quot;",
            "&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I tell her. &quot;But you can choose something else.&quot;",
            "She makes for the stairway as I hear a dozen footfalls reach the gravel lot below. Then she hesitates. &quot;There&apos;s something brewing from the East, I hear,&quot; she says. &quot;Melenia&apos;s had a dangerous change in its royalty. And I&apos;ve heard things.&quot;",
            "&quot;Heard what?&quot; I ask.",
            "&quot;Just stay aware,&quot; she says. &quot;Watch the East. And . . . tell my sister, that I&apos;m still alive.&quot;",
            "Then she disappears past the threshold. My hands clasp the Essence Tool as I give three seconds before I chase her again, but without wares to weigh her down, I find she&apos;s already gone."

            "But she wasn&apos;t mad at least, I thought. And I was right. She was asking me a favor, because she volunteered me for something I never asked to do, because she considered me weak enough to fill the role.",
            "And after I strolled around her town to size me for clothes that wouldn&apos;t make me stand out too much, I find myself now standing in an open lot with loads of other townsfolk, arranged in a laughable formation, feeling like I&apos;m at a little-league lacrosse practice if all the dads were swapped out for the kids.",
            "The Royal Guards line the dirt-and-grass lot with sheathed swords. We all face the most important guy, standing at the front as he tries not to laugh at the sorry arrangement of rejects that are only here for the free beer after the event. But at least it&apos;s for a good cause. And she volun-told me in advance early enough that I could take paid time off.",
            "&quot;Gentlemen, I&apos;m honored to gather you all here today,&quot; Katiya&apos;s commander says. &quot;Though our guards are powerful and skilled enough to defend all of Gaffesend, this a chance for you to develop the tools to defend yourselves. To feel comfortable and safe.&quot;",
            "The only time I remember doing anything like this was at some other kid&apos;s karate party when I was in first grade. And the instructor had to break the balsa wood plank with his own hands, because I was afraid of hurting myself. I look down at the wooden training sword, hoping it&apos;s just an odd prop for one of those weird stretching exercises.",

Name&apos;s Derry,&quot; he says, and I shake his large, calloused hand without turning around&mdash;too afraid of getting yelled at, though the three rows of husky townies hide me well. &quot;What part of town are you in?&quot; I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen you around.",
            "My nervousness impedes my filter. &quot;I live with Katiya,&quot; I say.",

            "&quot;Oh. So what do you do for the military then?&quot;",
            "My mind races back on Katiya&apos;s collection of rehearsed lies. &quot;I&apos;m one of the Royal Scientists&apos; protgs, so they wedged me in with the others, doing some research in Gaffesend.&quot;",
            "&quot;Well I don&apos;t blame you for being close to Katiya. If I was thirty years younger, with a body like that, I&apos;d fight a damn war for a woman like her,&quot; he says, reminding me of most of the technicians at my work. But the commander&apos;s voice cuts us off, before Derry can objectify her any further.",
            "&quot;Most of you are too, uh . . . &apos;heavy-set&apos; for running, so today will focus on basic, self-defense sword fighting and feats of strength.&quot; I flex and feel for the strength in my arms, hoping my two-a-week workouts give me enough muscle to overpower an Essenced tavern-brawler. He continues: &quot;While our brave, senior soldiers guard the borders of Gaffesend, this is a chance for our trainees to pass on their knowledge.&quot;",
            "I look to Katiya, flushed with that same sense of anxiety that seems like her factory setting. She musters a smile when we meet eyes, standing next to her beanpole boyfriend with their swords drawn, and as Aldrin rambles on about the value of self-defense like a first-amendment technician at my work, I twirl the wooden training sword in the dirt.",
            "&quot;So we&apos;ll start with basic technique. I&apos;m sure most of you have at least been trained a little &mdash; maybe by a family member or something.&quot; I remember playing defense in Lacrosse, jabbing breastplates with the basket end of my stick, and that&apos;s about it: besides shooting clays with my godfather in the FBI &mdash; but that&apos;s at least a hundred years away for these people.",
            "He shows us a basic downward swing before instructing us to stand further apart. I try a couple swings like all the others, without a single idea of what I&apos;m doing, and when the other cadets start to approach, I catch Katiya laughing at me.",
            "I flip her the bird, hoping sign language crosses our understandings: catching a glare from Jullian as he approaches to help his own two volunteers.",
            "Katiya says, &quot;The point is to swing through something. Don&apos;t stop short!&quot;",
            "&quot;But there&apos;s nothing to swing at,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Then swing at me,&quot; she says. I recall my father&apos;s words about hitting a girl. And then she adds: &quot;You&apos;ve already done it once before, haven&apos;t you? So what&apos;s the difference?&quot; Her lips peel into a mischievous smile, ready to hurl as many insults as it takes for me to go all out.",
            "Derry hands Katiya his wooden sword to add some fuel. &quot;She&apos;s one of the tough ones. I bet you won&apos;t last a minute.&quot;",
            "And with enough pressure, I chance a light swing at her. She slashes with half her power, nearly knocking the training sword out of my hands.",
            "&quot;I&apos;ve seen toddlers with less hesitation,&quot; she says. She swings the sword a couple times to draw the attention of other townies, adding pressure for me to defend my manhood. They turn their heads. &quot;Come on: do your worst, Cody of Denver!&quot;",
            "I white-knuckle the hilt of the sword like a baseball bat, taking a hard swing from the side. Katiya hardly twists her sword, and my blade glides up the polished flat surface.",
            "My momentum shifts entirely upright as I continue to spin, so committed to the strike that the training blade launches out of my hands. It travels point-first as it spins in the air like a surface-to-air missile with guards for fins, launching towards the commander as he recognizes all the turning faces.",
            "My muscles crumple faster than my soul as I watch Katiya&apos;s face change from humor to horror. Aldrin raises his arm in an instant, catching the smooth edge with a single hand. The edgeless blade slides for its full length before stopping at the hilt, the dull point halted inches from his face.",
            "He looks around at all the startled townsfolk, astounded at how quickly this training session descended into disarray. Once he traces the trajectory, the scarred commander stares daggers at me as he approaches from the center of the field. Dealing with my varsity coach was hard enough when I whipped that hard rubber lacrosse ball past his head: I&apos;ve never pissed off a warrior like him.",
            "He doesn&apos;t even have to open his mouth before I&apos;m off in apologetics. He draws the sword so it points directly at my chest.",
            "&quot;I, uh, do numbers and stuff. I&apos;m not any kind of warrior,&quot; I insist.",
            "But Katiya cuts in. &quot;It was my fault, Chief. I egged him on by insulting him a little. I wanted to see him angry.&quot;",
            "I think he&apos;s going to skewer me and roast my flesh over a spit, but he flips the blade around in his hands so that the hilt faces me. &quot;What&apos;s your name, son?&quot;",
            "The townsfolk look on with secondhand shame. Aldrin turns to around to shoo their focus away, and by the time I answer, they&apos;ve all returned to practicing techniques.",
            "&quot;Cody. Well, you have the passion,&quot; he says. &quot;And a strong arm. But you need to channel that into technique.&quot; He gestures to Katiya for her wooden sword. &quot;Is it alright if I borrow your volunteer?&quot;",
            "Katiya nods.",
            "&quot;The most important thing in sword fighting is balance, Mister Cody,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;You put all your power into a single swing &mdash; but what were you planning to do after?&quot;",
            "I stammer as the weight of the sword in my hands becomes awkward. &quot;I . . . I&apos;m not sure,&quot; I say, &quot;sir.&quot;",
            "&quot;Don&apos;t be ashamed, son. You&apos;ve done the Gods&apos; work coming out today as a volunteer, and I&apos;m grateful you&apos;re here. But Miss Katiya, here, is a true professional.&quot; ",
            "And it feels like a lion training a chihuahua.",
            "Aldrin turns to Katiya. &quot;Why don&apos;t you show Mr. Cody a standard forward strike?&quot;",
            "We stand aside. Katiya balances her feet so that her non-dominant foot is in front, with her hips facing forward. The steel sword slides out of her sheath with an iconic ring.",
            "&quot;And, see, her goal is to close the gap between herself and the enemy with the blade,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;But notice there, how she steps away slightly?&quot;",
            "&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say, transfixed at her training. She slashes forward with a perfect overhead swing, but steps slightly to the side with her dominant foot.",
            "&quot;And why don&apos;t you explain how this ties into balance, Katiya?&quot; Aldrin asks.",
            "&quot;The line of action goes directly at the enemy. But I step aside, in case there&apos;s a counterattack. It lets you keep your balance,&quot; she says.",
            "Aldrin claps me on the back, handing me the training sword. &quot;Why don&apos;t you give it a shot?&quot; He asks.",
            "I draw my left foot forward, as if I&apos;m beaming a lacrosse ball across the field for a breakaway. But I get confused with my footing.",
            "&quot;Why don&apos;t you practice with him, Katiya? Hold the sword with him.&quot; But then her face flushes. &quot;Don&apos;t be embarrassed. Mister Dunsmore needs to learn,&quot; he says, smiling as he withdraws.",
            "Katiya hesitantly approaches from behind me. I feel the cold steel of her breastplate press against my back as she reaches her gauntlets to grasp my hands, and I refuse to even try looking at Jullian. Her steel boots align with my feet as I stand off-foot-forward, and as I slice down with the wooden sword, her hips press into mine, guiding my legs to swing in rhythm with the sword, and I end up to the side of that perfect line of action.",
            "&quot;Don&apos;t get used to it,&quot; she whispers in my ear, and I swear I can feel the heat radiate off her face.",
            "&quot;Very good,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;Now give me a hundred of those: now!&quot; ",
            "I tense in tonal panic, locked with the sword in its last position. ",
            "Aldrin laughs. &quot;Sorry. Force of habit. Do, uh . . . twenty or something, yeah?&quot;",
            "&quot;Sir, yes sir,&quot; I say, as if I&apos;m a pledge in the fraternity again.",
            "I take a couple practice swings, mirroring Katiya&apos;s technique as best as I can. And as Derry steps to the side&mdash;relieved he doesn&apos;t have to leverage his husky frame for sword practice, ever closer to the free ale on the other side of the session, Katiya takes at least ten minutes before she can turn and face me again."

Some men look like they&apos;re about to cut the whole damn course, but the senior guards are back &mdash; and Aldrin set them up so no one can cut the others. I can&apos;t see the course behind the backs of the tall and muscular farmers and their field hands. I&apos;ll have to play it entirely by ear.",

I stagger my feet and let my fingers soak into the cold, wet soil, and just as I&apos;m about to anticipate the blast, I feel Derry&apos;s hands grasp my back.",
            "The gun blast echoes between the mountains. Derry pushes me with all his strength, and suddenly I stagger into first: sliding a quarter-distance of the mud pit beneath the barbed wire.",
            "I was a three-sport athlete, and I immediately think back to football season in the fall, when snow still saturated the frozen ground, and I&apos;m lighter than I was then when I wore pads and a helmet. Lighter than the ones before me, my elbows thrash the ground as mud splashes in my face, peerless in the moment, absorbed in the cheers that crescendo with my name.",
            "My old-world shirt is soaked in heavy mud, and I&apos;m drenched down to the Under Armor compression shirt, but I feel that rare window of joy seize my body in its entirety, and I&apos;m thankful my emotional curse doesn&apos;t eclipse my enjoyment of the moment. I hear the sloshing and clambering of men that look like Vikings, grunting and growling with their lust of liquor.",
            "I rise at the end of the mud crawl, glancing back to find my teammate Derry not far behind: his wife cheering him on from the sidelines. I hear Katiya shout my name, and turn to face the next obstacle: a tall climbing wall with several ropes hanging from the top. I&apos;m not as light as I was after a whole four years of shotgunning beers in the fraternity, but it feels as if I have circuits like Katiya, from all the energy that floods my veins.",
            "My hands grasp the ragged weave of rope, tucking it beneath my arm as I take the first steps up the wall. The eyes are all on me now as I compensate for my previous failure. My arms grab hand-over-hand as the mud-soaked townies clamber like zombies, with groans that lust for liquor instead of brains, shaking the rope as they grasp it themselves, destabilizing my footing on the wall.",
            "But I tighten my hands on the rope. Past halfway, I find it stretches less, advantaged by the boost from Derry that left the rope loose for much of my ascent. And as I approach the top, I feel my stomach drop when I look at the other side.",
            "I thought it was another rope down. But instead, I find three logs spanning a two-story-high stretch from one tower to another: the bottom filled with murky, freezing water of an unknown depth. The adrenaline outpaces the panic as the crowd of knights and supporters shifts up to watch as I take my first steps on the log: tempted to hug and hump my way across, but I take a deep breath and take my time.",
            "So far down, Katiya and Jullian stand beside each other, along with Pax and Ryder and the catgirl Naya and a pale-looking Bertram that shakes his fist.",
            "I scrape my muddy feet before I proceed: still a ways ahead of the others, and I take my time stepping across&mdash;like an alcoholic walking a line to show an officer that he can drive.",
            "But I catch an odd footing. Panic seizes my chest when the elevation imposes itself, and I fall to my chest as the crowd groans in anticipation. But I hear their cheers still coming strong: Pax chanting &quot;Science Guy&quot; in their tongue until the others join, and they cheer when I regain my footing, stumbling slowly before I make it to the other side.",
            "Next is a span of sixteen-or-so bars dangling over the same sickening drop. I doubt my adrenaline will last if I don&apos;t keep going: un-Essenced like the others and at a certain disadvantage.",
            "But I continue: taking the first suspended bar in my hands as my feet decide whether they want to leave the safety of the platform, making the mistake of looking down and noticing patches of grass I HOPE are just floating, and not islands that would break my legs.",
            "But the excitement is too great. My exhilarated mind flashes back to the breakaways of all those lacrosse games I miss so damn much with Miguel&mdash;and lost in the emotional rhyme, I realize I&apos;m already halfway across, steadily swinging between rails until I make it to the other side.",
            "I turn back to find Derry waving at the other side, making some gesture I interpret as a &quot;thumbs-up&quot; as he waits to cross, using his meager townie Essence to strengthen his grasp before it&apos;s his turn to cross the bars.",
            "The end of the towers is a series of vertical ropes. And as the others gain on me with their powerful arms, swinging like silverback gorillas, I slide down the rope after saturating my hands in the cool mud caked on my undershirt, regaining my footing as I make it to the bottom.",
            "I reach the end of the &apos;U&apos;-shape to find the joining section as a simple sprint before more low-level towers at ground height, and I take off for the next side, watching as the Essenced knights double my speed to get a spot on the other side.",
            "I feel a presence behind me. One of Jullian&apos;s non-guard buddies I recognize from before uses his advantage to sprint faster, and he&apos;s several breaths behind me as we round the last turn of the U-shape, coming to a near stop as we approach a bunch of logs that protrude from a gravel pit: a series of one-footed jumps that focus on technique over strength.",
            "Half cheer my name. But half cheer for my adversary, named Delvin. We balance the desire for speed over the failure of the fall, wagering the swiftness of every jump. And as we&apos;re neck-and-neck, I decide to dash the rest of the logs, back in first as I make it to the last challenge.",
            "All that&apos;s left is one last straightaway with hurdles. It was my event in track when I was lighter, and had a six-pack on my body instead of in my hand every weekend. But the muscle memory is there, and as I take lane two of six, my rival takes four as we sprint with all we have, letting the fanfare flood our muscles where our exasperated breath falls short.",
            "My steps reach a rhythm like I&apos;m sprinting down the hundred-meter span of hurdles on my high school track: over the long logs in seven steps and a leap, seven steps and a leap, seven steps and a leap.",
            "The goal is getting closer, stacked with kegs. The beautiful town ladies are tensioned with corsets that rise their breasts as a beckoning call to the grizzly men behind us, raising mugs of fresh ale as sirens that call their lascivious warriors to come.",
            "A leap and seven steps. A leap and seven steps. And I see Katiya at the finish, smiling ear-to-ear as her boyfriend stands next to her, cheering on Delvin. And I&apos;m so close now, about to place first, when I hear a pained groan and a loud exhale as Delvin crumples into the second-to-last log hurdle.",
            "And I stop in my tracks, inches from the finish. I look behind me to find Delvin grasping his chest without wind as the horde of others is quickly approaching.",
            "But I decide to turn around as I huff for breath, climbing over the log to approach my rival, offering him a hand so he can rise from the sullen ground.",
            "I take his arm across my shoulders. A few racers sprint past us, transfixed by the boobs and ale ahead of them. And as we stumble over the logs in steps instead of leaps, I feel Delvin&apos;s weight shift when Derry grabs his other arm.",
            "We finish twelfth-or-so. Katiya and all her friends congratulate the three of us when we cross. The air stinks of salty sweat, but the ale is sweet and savory as we chug the carbonated brew like cold water.",
            "We hang around for a while until Aldrin presents an award to first place, and though he recognizes my efforts, he presents it to another lean, younger man that passed us while we carried Delvin. Katiya and a few friends watch my face as I react to this loss, and though Delvin is distraught, I laugh and cheer as the winner holds his makeshift trophy in the air.",
            "I find an emotion in Katiya&apos;s face that I&apos;ve never seen before. She looks away when I return her glance. Her other friends chatter on about how I deserve the title, and even Jullian offers me words of encouragement, thanking me for aiding his friend.",
            "A long day ends with us walking home. I say I left my stuff at Katiya&apos;s so we could all walk together, and when they&apos;re all distracted, I slip inside and disappear through the door&mdash;quick to feel the bliss of a hot shower.",
            "After toweling off, I head downstairs to grab a glass of water in my boxers. I hear Jullian and Katiya heading upstairs on their side of the dimensional wall. Katiya whispers something to Jullian as he continues to climb the stairs, and after she takes off her heavy boots, I hear her footfalls as she approaches my door.",
            "She knocks with a knuckle. I&apos;m quick to answer on the other side, peeking out no more than my head and a shoulder.",
            "&quot;Hey &mdash; thanks for doing this today,&quot; she whispers. &quot;You surely didn&apos;t start off so well, but you ended in a blaze.&quot;",
            "&quot;Of course,&quot; I tell her. &quot;It was worth the PTO.&quot;",
            "She turns to close the door, but then hesitates for a moment: something still on her mind that she&apos;s tempted to ask. &quot;But at the end there . . . you were surely going to win,&quot; she says. &quot;Why did you give Delvin a hand before you crossed?&quot; ",
            "She looks up with anticipation, as if she disbelieves the face I wore when they were handing out awards. But something makes her want to hear me say it: to convince her of something.",
            "And so I tell her the truth.",
            "&quot;I just didn&apos;t think the ale would taste any different,&quot; I whisper. &quot;You know?&quot;"

            "I have no idea what he means. &quot;But it&apos;s a shirt with a collar, right?&quot; I ask. &quot;I don&apos;t have the fancy noble clothes from your world. This was woven by hand!&quot;",
            "&quot;And it looks like you&apos;re off to add your name to the Drclaration Of Independence,&quot; he says. Cody cracks a smile as he slips his feet onto a pair of his work shoes, wearing what he calls a weekend-formal shirt with stretchy fabric and a sharp collar.",
            "&quot;Are you really sure you want me to go, then? All you&apos;ve done is insult me since I showed you the only other outfit I have,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;m dressed by the guard. They only let me take a hundred pounds of personal items when I came here.&quot;",
            "&quot;It shows,&quot; he says.",
            "I sneer at him. &quot;Are you done?&quot;",

            "&quot;Not yet. Give me a second,&quot; he says, retreating back upstairs to rustle through his cupboard. Half a minute later, he returns with another nice shirt. It&apos;s stitched with the letters NAVIDSON-MONROE: evidently woven by one of the fancy machines of his world.",
            "&quot;I&apos;m going to fill a whole closet from you at this rate,&quot; I say, hesitant to take another garment.",
            "&quot;It&apos;s been like a month since the last time I gave you that shirt,&quot; he says. &quot;And we still haven&apos;t even properly shopped for you yet. I got this in a New Years raffle from my company when they were trying to empty out the old employee storeroom. It&apos;s a women&apos;s medium, and I don&apos;t have the body for it.&quot;",
            "He extends his hand though the doorway. I crack the door shut to quickly change, trading the bright, uneven stitch-work for a smooth, silken, short-sleeve polo, surprised by how little I feel of the texture &mdash; and in moments like these, it makes me hesitant to indulge any further in even the simplest of his world&apos;s conveniences.",
            "&quot;Well?&quot; He asks. I crack the door open again as he takes his work passport into his pocket. His eyes glow with a certain sarcastic pride. &quot;You look like a new intern. Just don&apos;t ask the guys for any questions on your projects, or they&apos;ll never leave you alone.&quot;",
            "I get the impression it&apos;s some backhanded compliment. &quot;I&apos;ll be quiet unless talked to.&quot;",
            "&quot;No, not this time,&quot; he says. &quot;The whole point is to interact with people! You get to meet my team: it&apos;s an open house. The world left behind keeping women quiet a while ago.&quot;",
            "&quot;Okay. And...&quot; I gesture to my boots: the last oddity we haven&apos;t discussed. It&apos;s the casual pair, emblazoned with the faintest trace of metal around the toe and heel. &quot;Are these really okay?&quot;",
            "&quot;Just means you can go on the floor, if you&apos;re wearing steel toes like that.&quot; Cody gestures for me to enter his car port. &quot;You look fine. We should really get moving, or else they&apos;ll eat all the pizza before we can even get there.&quot;",
            "He cracks the door to the car port, and the solid steel gate slides along the rails. It&apos;s been more than a month since my first and last adventure in his car, and I feel ready to withstand all the twists and turns.",
            "I gently feather the car door open and sit in the seat. My body feels so light and free without the weight of the armor, as if I&apos;m wearing nothing at all, and after he pulls out of the car room into the street, the gate closes behind us.",
            "We take a different route this time, driving straight instead of turning left. It&apos;s been about a month since the self-defense training program, and with all that time passed in forgettable engagements, we share a couple stories from our lives.",
            "I describe how fast the town of Gaffesend transitions from festive joy to dreadful unease. I talk about the letters from my family back home, and how proud they say they are of my brother and I &mdash; though I&apos;m glad they aren&apos;t around to see what the other townsfolk think. I tell him how my mistake still overshadows me, and that I&apos;m glad they&apos;ve forgotten my foolish leap between buildings, and how I&apos;ve returned to prowling the streets.",
            "He tells me about work, but doesn&apos;t say much: just that he&apos;s nervous about being let go, and that he&apos;s developing something &quot;stupid&quot; that might make or break his career. I&apos;m entranced by the unfamiliar foliage that whips past us, pretending we&apos;re driving on the backroads between Gaffesend and the capital, surprised at how open Cody&apos;s world actually is when you get away from all the tall buildings.",
            "I ask him about Kei: he says not much has changed. He asks me about Jullian, and I say not much has changed, either: still middling in our relationship.",
            "His eyes glaze over with an unfamiliar joy when we wind the switchbacks, taking the turns with a certain passion, and though we&apos;re taking his daily passage to work, I doubt it&apos;s related to his employment.",
            "We pull up to the gates an hour after midday to find them open. The armor-less guard waves us through, and we come to a stop in a large dirt lot.",

            "He rifles through the center cupboard on his car, pulling out a cheap pair of dark glasses with letters on the side. &quot;Here.&quot;",
            "&quot;For what?&quot;",
            "&quot;I forgot about your eyes,&quot; he says. &quot;I just got so used to them from looking in them all the time.&quot;",
            "My face flushes. &quot;Are you&mdash;&quot;",
            "&quot;No . . . no! Not at all. Calm down,&quot; he says, covering his face with a nicer pair of glasses as he gestures for me to exit. I CAREFULLY open the door, so I don&apos;t hit the vehicle next to me.",
            "&quot;You keep disguising glasses on you?&quot; I ask. &quot;When would you need them?&quot;",
            "&quot;They protect your eyes from the sun, dummy,&quot; he says, overcompensating for his accidental pick-up line. I feel my nerves rise as we approach the massive building, shaded like night as I look through the lenses, my body masked behind Cody as a nervous shadow.",
            "An unfamiliar voice calls to him as we approach his colleagues. &quot;So you finally made it to your first work event,&quot; the lady says. &quot;Even I made it to one before you!&quot; Her face changes when she sees me step out from behind Cody, reminding me a little bit of Jullian. &quot;And who is this you brought?&quot;",
            "&quot;This is Katiya. A neighbor of mine,&quot; Cody says.",

            "The installation looks like one of those dug-in shelters on the border of the Purgatory Line, and when we enter the quaint area dug into the side of the mountain, facing the set of reflective steel doors, I expect they&apos;ll open to a grand chamber beneath the ground.",
            "But when Cody&apos;s paramour presses the glowing arrow button, the doors slide open with a chime, exposing a tiny room that the three of us enter. The metal doors are just about to close when a fourth guy shows up, sticking his hands directly into the metal jaws to keep them open.",
            "It&apos;s a young man with the same aesthetic as Cody, except he has beach-blonde hair and a much more energized personality. He stares at me with his hazel eyes. &quot;Ha! Looks like I made it just in time,&quot; he says. &quot;Cody, my man, and Kei. And who are you?&quot;",
            "His conversational flow throws me off guard, stammering for words, but he speaks again.",
            "&quot;I&apos;m Reed. Reed Broderick,&quot; he says, extending his hand.",

            "&quot;Bad hangover, huh?&quot; Kei asks. &quot;I hope Cody didn&apos;t challenge you to any drinking games. Ever since he joined that fraternity, he became a fish!&quot;",
            "I ask, &quot;A fish? As in...&quot;",
            "Cody cuts the silence with a laugh. &quot;Very funny. We thought we&apos;d pregame this little mixer to make it go faster, you know?&quot; And then he takes me aside, muttering to me under the tone of his breath. &quot;You can take the shades off now.&quot;",
            "&quot;But my eyes,&quot; I whisper. &quot;Won&apos;t they think I&apos;m weird?&quot;",
            "&quot;It&apos;s fine. Remember the lie I gave you?&quot;",
            "&quot;Caused-play,&quot; I say. &quot;But shouldn&apos;t I at least know what caused this?&quot;",
            "Cody creases his brow with his fingers in disappointment as the man called Reed continues.  &quot;Well, hey, quite a coincidence you work at Navidson-Monroe too, huh?&quot; He asks, pointing to my shirt. It says ENGINEERING TEAM beneath it. &quot;So are you, like, a purchaser or something? Or are you on the Aerospace team? I don&apos;t see you in the main office,&quot; he says.",
            "I stammer over a response, watching Cody prevent his face from changing shades of red when he realizes he&apos;s trapped himself again. &quot;It was that shirt I won in the raffle that didn&apos;t fit me,&quot; he says, &quot;and I decided to give it to her.&quot;",
            "Kei laughs. &quot;You don&apos;t have to explain,&quot; she says, catching contagion of Cody&apos;s secondhand embarrassment. &quot;Unless you&apos;re dating or something. But even then, you know. You wouldn&apos;t have to...&quot;",
            "&quot;We&apos;re not,&quot; Cody insists, turning his eyes down as Reed masterfully switches subjects.",
            "&quot;Well then I hope it will be a better raffle this year. My dad said they were just emptying out the corporate closet of shirts before the moths could get to them. And all those mugs and pencils and flash drives they were handing out at the job fairs,&quot; Reed says. His piercing eyes meet mine. &quot;Say, Katiya: where do you work if you don&apos;t work here?&quot;",
            "&quot;Oh. I work in, uh, military.&quot;",
            "Cody elbows me.",

            "&quot;I&apos;m in the mountains,&quot; I say, unsure how much further I&apos;m digging myself, wondering if I could ever be ready enough for Cody to bring me anywhere.",
            "Cody interjects, &quot;She&apos;s stationed up near Grand Lake, working on some topographical research, for uh, NOAA.&quot; He glares at me, but in a humored way. &quot;Guess we shouldn&apos;t have pre-gamed so hard, huh? I told you to start clear.&quot;",
            "&quot;Well, you two seem pretty close,&quot; Kei says. &quot;Reed and I had to cheat, making each other our plus one.&quot;",

            "The carriage lets out to a breathtaking atrium with a curved glass ceiling, surrounded on both sides by stairs and private walled rooms. The chatter is almost deafening from the volume of well-dressed people &mdash; like a royal ball &mdash; and when I look up to the sky, I find a full view of the mountainside through the ceiling glass.",
            "But a lady is poised at the top, standing there with her husband that almost looks like one of our farmers from his brawny arms. As she approaches, exposing a name tag that says KIMBERLY (KIM), I find a reticence suddenly take over Cody, even though it&apos;s too late.",
            "&quot;Kei! Oh, hey, so good to see you,&quot; she says, smiling with dimples from ear-to-ear. &quot;And there&apos;s my son. Won&apos;t you say hello?&quot;",

            "&quot;Well isn&apos;t he a lucky son of a gun?&quot; Alan says, and I feel the urge to drag Cody away before his redness turns to blue. Reed begins to introduce himself to Kim with Kei as Alan gestures for us to keep walking. &quot;Well, don&apos;t let an old chunk of coal like me hold you kids up. It&apos;s nice to meet ya.&quot; He gives me a firm handshake. I tension my hand a little harder than usual.  &quot;And sweet Jesus, she&apos;s got a grip!&quot; He turns to his progeny. Some surly thought skips the queue in his mind. &quot;Son, you know what they say about strong wrists in a woman&mdash;&quot;",
            "&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say, &quot;nice to meet you.&quot; I take Cody&apos;s hand to rush him to the water table, pulsing some healing Essence into him so he might not pass out, but he seems fine. I barricade us both with a group of young trainees from a local seminary, led around by their instructor.",
            "He scans the table until he finds something harder, flashing his badge so they give him a painted can. After a crack and several guzzles later, his soul returns. &quot;Thanks for saving me, there,&quot; he says.",
            "&quot;That&apos;s kind of my job,&quot; I tell him. Then I grin. &quot;So is that what you brought me here for? A piece of arm candy to get your love interest off that other guy&apos;s arm?&quot;",

            "I spend the rest of the day in Cody&apos;s shadow, avoiding long conversations with his coworkers and eating as much of the free food as we can. And after watching as many of the children&apos;s science demonstrations as possible &mdash; while Cody eagerly riffed on about all these concepts named after scientists &mdash; we take a break on the east balcony that opposes the view from the elevator, looking out across his world&apos;s well-developed landscape.",
            "&quot;But it&apos;s fluids,&quot; I say. &quot;You say you&apos;re studying fluids when you study aeroplanes. But fluid is water, not air.&quot;",
            "&quot;Air has a lot of the same properties of fluids, so we call it fluids,&quot; he says. Then he mentions several scientists from his world as if name-dropping will support his argument. Bernoulli. Lagrange. Some guy he says is an oiler, which sounds like he deals with fluids, only supporting me further.",
            "&quot;It&apos;s Euler,&quot; he says, beginning to gesture with hands that only hurt his explanation. &quot;So there&apos;s streamlines, like this,&quot; he gestures, &quot;that you look at,&quot; he gestures, &quot;you know,&quot; he gestures again, &quot;and then there&apos;s streaklines. And you can look at it through the LaGrangian form that emphasizes states of a moving frame of reference, but the Euler form is for a control volume FIXED instead of moving, and in Aerospace, which is what I want to get into, I find that . . .&quot;",
            "There&apos;s something entrancing about his passion when he rattles on about concepts I can&apos;t hope to understand. I find such a radiant light when I meet eyes with his, and he thinks he&apos;s explaining it clearly.",
            "I nod my head as I turn to gaze out across the landscape, still bright with early-morning sun, trying to wrap my head around the fact that this whole landmass is safe from ocean to ocean. And with no clear lines partitioning them, the buildings grow like weeds without the culling force of constant conflict.",
            "&quot; . . . So Bernoulli says the pressure difference pushes up on the wing,&quot; he says, spouting more names and using his Navidson-Monroe water bottle now as a prop. I forget to nod. &quot;And now I realize you have no idea what I&apos;m talking about.&quot;",
            "I smile. &quot;But your enthusiasm is refreshing. Pray tell: do you know how many people have the emotional resources to be passionate like you where I live?&quot; I say. &quot;Your people focus on designing planes and big machines. All our people have to think about is what&apos;s moving around in the dark.&quot;",
            "&quot;That&apos;s why you should come over more,&quot; Cody says. &quot;You might have scared me at first, but I like spending time with you now.&quot;",
            "I adjust my sweaty hand on the hot steel railing, unaware I&apos;m sliding closer to his. &quot;You aren&apos;t too bad either,&quot; I say. We touch with a spark, then withdraw our hands. &quot;A good friend. I&apos;m just afraid of getting comfortable with all of this.&quot;",

            "We step inside to tour the last section we haven&apos;t seen yet: the Engineering showroom, with models of all the famous planes like the Flawless Diamond and the SR-71. Cody continues his ramblings, dumbing them down a little further as I look at him with a refreshing sense of admiration. He talks in my language of war: about the big bombs named after a little boy and a heavy man, and the cold war between nations that followed.

He scrolls the subjects of those correspondences, getting angrier and more dejected as he looks further and further. &quot;So they just don&apos;t consider me, huh? Because my dad doesn&apos;t have a fucking name around here, and I came from nothing, so they&mdash;&quot; He curbs his words when he realizes I&apos;m still here. &quot;Heh. Sorry, Katiya. Just some work stuff,&quot; he says, smiling with an embarrassed laugh.",

            "&quot;He totally would have filled it out. You see the way he looks up at this place? His eyes get more sun dreaming of this place than any of the lifers that sit next to the windows.&quot;",
            "&quot;Huh.&quot;",
            "&quot;Maybe it was an accident. Some kind of mix-up?&quot;",

            "&quot;Well, he got you hired here,&quot; Kei says.",
            "&quot;But there was more,&quot; Reed says. &quot;I was listening to them on the patio out back behind our place. He said he&apos;s clearing the way for me. And that &apos;that other engineer wouldn&apos;t be an obstacle.&apos;&quot;",
            "&quot;The &apos;other engineer?&apos; You don&apos;t mean...&quot;",
            "&quot;He said Cody was unexceptional. Just did his time and left, not really ever trying once he reached a certain point. That the life left him. That he never makes an effort to meet anyone, and that he&apos;d be easy to make an excuse for,&quot; Reed says, and I watch Cody bow his head as he balls his fists. &quot;I mean, I like the guy a lot. We&apos;re pretty similar, and I really want to be buddies with him.&quot;",
            "Kei takes a long pause. And I almost think she&apos;ll stand up for him. I hope she does, for Cody&apos;s sake, but she says something else. &quot;We used to be pretty close, you know. High school, we dated: just like his mom said, and he was so full of this joy, it was like staring at the sun.&quot;",
            "Reed asks, &quot;But what?&quot;",
            "&quot;But the summer I left for school was when he lost his brother.&quot;",
            "&quot;He lost his brother?&quot;",
            "&quot;Yeah. To some conflict in the war: Jackson was a Navy SEAL. And Cody never opened up about it. And by the time his last year of high school ended, he followed me to college, but I couldn&apos;t even recognize him. He was just a shell. And he still is, though sometimes there&apos;s a glimmer of that guy who had so much joy. That I liked a lot,&quot; Kei says, looking around nervously. &quot;I hope something changes. Because he&apos;s surely next out of all of us.&quot;",
            "They turn to leave. And Reed says, &quot;Well, at least I can be that for you.&quot;",

            "&quot;Stand down, soldier,&quot; Cody says. &quot;It&apos;s alright. Nothing they said was wrong.&quot;",
            "&quot;But this Reed guy is slighting you! His family line is aimed to cut you down because you&apos;re in his way, though you&apos;re the venerable one,&quot; I say, grabbing his shirt while I turn his chin to look in my eyes, finding the crest of his tears ready to break.",
            "&quot;Maybe I deserve it,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve become a mess since then. I dragged myself through this stupid degree because it&apos;s what I used to want to do. I&apos;m running on fumes of a past when I was fueled on that thing: the spark, what Kei and anyone else liked about me.&quot; He sniffles, trying to keep his tears to a professional medium. &quot;No passion. No prospect of a girlfriend in years. I don&apos;t know . . . I think I just suck now. Even my parents can sniff it out.&quot;",
            "His words anger me because they insult someone I&apos;ve come to care about, and it&apos;s him, and of all my years of guarding, I feel nothing more than the urge to protect this guy and his precious dream.",
            "I feel the heat rise in my circuits as I grab the collar of his shirt, forcing him to look at me as I pin him against the display. I dissolve his tears with the Essence in my hands. &quot;You listen. Your dreams are far from stupid, Cody Dunsmore, and you are gods-damn precious,&quot; I say.",

            "&quot;Shut up,&quot; I command, jostling him against the wall to shock him into a sense of truth. &quot;Can&apos;t you see that you&apos;re already enough as you are? You say the ale doesn&apos;t taste any different. And you&apos;re the only person I&apos;ve ever found who means it. You care,&quot; I say, &quot;so Gods-damn much about anyone.&quot;",
            "&quot;It&apos;s just lonely,&quot; he says. He gestures for me to get off him, and I help him to his feet. &quot;I think something broke in me that I can&apos;t fix.&quot;",
            "&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.",
            "&quot;I said I&apos;d tell you why I invited you here. I mean, yeah &mdash; all the engineers and techs and business guys were ogling you, and you&apos;re an amazing piece of arm candy. You even made my family have faith in me again.&quot; He laughs. &quot;But I brought you here because I have no one else to share this with. It feels like everyone&apos;s left me or moved on. And I&apos;m tired now. And it&apos;s getting so late.&quot;",
            "I wrap my arms around him, letting the heat of my body speak where my words fall short. He hesitates, but then gently returns my embrace, holding for just a second before he releases. And even in his act of forced vulnerability, I almost feel a piece of myself open, too.",

            "&quot;Huh?&quot; I ask.",
            "&quot;Bastards have probably already eaten their way through the food trucks,&quot; he says. &quot;I totally forgot. Usually it&apos;s like eight bucks for a slice of pizza, but Navidson-Monroe&apos;s footing the bill.&quot;",
            "I don&apos;t know what a food truck is. But if it&apos;s designed to move, and it has food in it, I assume it won&apos;t be around for long.",

            "&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask, noticing his face flushes lightly now that we&apos;re out of the dark.",
            "&quot;You have a boyfriend. And yet you almost made me break our tenth rule.&quot;",
            " &quot;Then you must be weak,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Too weak for me,&quot; I say, though I feel refreshed by his sincerity. &quot;But that doesn&apos;t mean I can&apos;t help you.&quot;"

            "But despite the courage it took to come back here, it feels like no time has passed. It&apos;s not just because she&apos;s wearing the same white-and-blue summer dress she wore all those summers ago. Nor is it because she&apos;s wearing the same perfume.

Looking at the mountains makes me wonder how Katiya&apos;s date is going, hoping that she finds all the things she missed inside of Jullian. The silhouette of an image overshadows the entire car through the windows, but I can&apos;t see the full picture. I spend more time looking at how beautiful Kei is, accented with dots like the shading in a comic book, how little she&apos;s changed since the last time we were here, and wonder how much I&apos;ve changed in ways that I don&apos;t even realize.",

Meaningless hook-ups, lonely nights when my sorrow almost set me over the edge, and even though I long to relish the comfort of this exact moment, I&apos;m so afraid of showing it. I&apos;m afraid this feeling isn&apos;t what I want it to be, losing grasp of my ability to judge, falling headlong into that hedonistic sense of longing.",

It&apos;s surely not his business to care, anyways: just to focus on our safe  passage from the Knights&apos; Quarter of Gaffesend to the day spa in the springs. And as the carriage jostles us around on uneven terrain, I grab his shirt to pull him closer, stabilizing the two of us while the rest of the world trembles.",

The nostalgia of this love brings me back to the better times, when all we had to do was study, and not to serve our sentence on the brink of war. He tastes the same way he did all those years ago.

            "But I was far from inspired or soulful when I woke up three hours ago: the first time in a while that the rapping of the knocker beat me to breakfast, causing me to rush through the motions of getting ready. I wore the odd undershirt that Cody gave me to find the slightest advantage when inspiration and soul feel unreachable &mdash; especially after the night before, when I sent Jullian home without any parting grant of affection.",
            "Now I stand in a shooting stall for a short interlude. Test three of four: a brief intermission between demonstrating acts of war. Strength and conditioning were easy because I can train both of them outside the base, avoiding the garrulous crowds that love to speak ill of the weak. And though I placed in the top percentage for each of them, it&apos;s the remaining tests that concern me the most. Especially the last one: because defending the innocent is the entire point of service as a Royal Guard.",
            "My finger hovers off the conductive plate of the aged IGR-4 Cinderjack rifle, a beast that&apos;s never seen war since it&apos;s spent most of its life collecting dust in the armory. I tuck my elbow to my chest, trying desperately to steady my trembling hand on the grip. My overwhelming concern for failure spills over the threshold of my mind, leaking its way into all my nerves and muscles. And the more the anger resists the trembling in my hands, tensing the tendons into a static position, the less control I find I have.",
            "My right hand impatiently waits on my left arm to steady the barrel of the Cinderjack. My eye stares directly downrange through the crosshairs at a disparate spread of punctured points in the paper, depicting the silhouette of a Chymaeran with its sickly, amethyst claws drawn. But not a single shot has hit the two-dimensional bastard in the head, between its triangle of eyes. Only two of the five shots I&apos;ve taken have ripped the black ink on the parchment.",
            "The Essenced energy coalesces in my right index finger. I can feel the conductivity of the cold steel plate connected to the ignition chamber as my finger is drawn towards the metal, and when I lightly contact the combustion plate, transferring the Essence to incinerate the blasting powder, the round blasts through the rifle, startling me again, punching a sixth hole in the upper left corner of the page.",
            "I look around, expecting laughter, but the shooting range&apos;s bays are partitioned by thick steel blinders. Behind me is only the bag of gear I brought for all the exams. And when I look out across the span of twenty sheets, I&apos;m the worst of all of them. ",
            "The guard next to me holds a tight spread of eleven shots that are damn-near heart center, surely the best out of everyone &mdash; and yet my hands tremble so much that I have to rest the rifle against the stand. I watch my rival&apos;s rifle protrude from the edge of the partition one last time to purge the mag of its twelfth and final round. ",
            "His barrel is steady. His aim is calculated. And when their finger conducts Essence through the Cinderjack, the rifle hardly jumps as a bullet hole erupts through the black on the page: completing a circle of holes so perfectly apportioned that it clips a single paper snowflake, excising the entire Chymaeran&apos;s chest.",
            "And then a set of long, black, manicured nails reaches for the rope of the pulley, dragging their disfigured parchment victim back to the firing line. And when it arrives, I raise my rifle in response, insecure about all the time I&apos;m wasting. I fight the tremor I&apos;ve had since the night of the fire, but just before I can begin to take aim, I feel a hand on my shoulder.",
            "&quot;Stop for a moment. You have to stop holding on so tightly.&quot;",

She&apos;s trying to be helpful, but her words sound like ice, lacking any of the warmth that might comfort me. Yet her eyes light with some odd glimmer of excitement.",

            "&quot;I was in the same Strategies class. For the final project, you gave that &apos;after-action&apos; analysis on what should have happened during the Siege of Hillfar &mdash; and told the story of your survival.

            "&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say, hoping I can bend the anger of that truth into six more perfect rounds in a Chymaeran&apos;s chest. &quot;I came here to serve first. I&apos;ll be living with these people, so I should know them.&quot;",
            "&quot;Then I ought to join you one of these times,&quot; Aryn says, rolling the target sheet in her claws until it becomes a punctured scroll. &quot;Well, I hope our paths cross again soon. And if it&apos;s today, I won&apos;t be showing you any mercy. You&apos;re a good rival, and there&apos;s a lot I think you can teach me.&quot;",

            "&quot;So you noticed,&quot; I say, knowing perfectly well that they did. And when he says it, it makes me feel something that I haven&apos;t felt in a while. It&apos;s a feeling like all those times in college, when my roommates kept asking me to go out, but I kept turning them down &mdash; but they still never stopped asking, and it meant the world to me.",

            "It feels like a face-off. If this were a lacrosse match, we&apos;d be on our knees as midies at the dead center of the field: sticks raised, baskets inverted, pining after the same ball at the sound of a whistle.",

            "It&apos;s the unpracticed way the weight of the armor restrains my body. For so long, the cosmetic shell of thin steel was all I wore on my missions in the interior. Swinging my arms down with a wooden sword feels foreign when my hands have calloused more from benign fieldwork. All my muscle memory remembers is tilling fields and raking leaves, only adding to the panic I feel when the five of us stand beneath the fluttering crimson flag.",
            "The commander orders us to &quot;chalk up,&quot; and we dip our weapons into the barrel of red powder. Paxton traces lines beneath the burrows of his eye sockets. Ryder loads powdered crimson marking rounds into the rifle. Naya settles the dusted dagger in a holster across her chest, and as I sheathe the chalk-covered training sword in my holster, feeling no better practiced than someone like Cody, I try to draw the courage to admit how much I need this.",
            "My eyes scan the landscape. It&apos;s the decrepit servants&apos; quarter of the old castle: the same place I chased down the thief, only three stories lower and vacant of drifters and vagrants. The wooden roofs either burned in the ancient siege or crumbled to dust from so many cycles of calamitous weather, leaving only the stone walls to partition a perfect battlefield for observation. And we stand at the northeast end, preparing ourselves to strike the blue team in the southwest.",
            "While Paxton&apos;s busy deliberating over designs for his improvised face paint &mdash; coated redder than the faces of Sun-scorched vagabonds, the special headband still hangs from a peg on the crimson flag, its gold stripe reflecting the meager light obscured by the tall castle walls.",

            "&quot;So we treat the bystanders as hostages?&quot; Naya asks.",
            "&quot;Yeah. And the other team treats them as targets for protection,&quot; Ryder replies. He takes the glistening span of fabric from the pole, turning to Bertram. &quot;You&apos;ve been out for a while. Do you need the boost?&quot;",
            "&quot;They said this is just practice for me,&quot; he says. &quot;Doesn&apos;t mean I won&apos;t pull through. But you should give it to someone who needs it.&quot;",

            "My mind races through volumes of combat strategies, whatever I can remember. It&apos;s a lot of facts, of old battles, of tactics and results, but the thoughts struggle to churn out answers when I&apos;m so focused on the inevitable. I think of how it will feel when I return to the warfront. I imagine how Jullian will move on. How&mdash;",

            "&quot;I&apos;ve got it. We&apos;ll split three ways,&quot; I say.

Go ahead of us and create a distraction that will shift their focus behind the house.&quot; ",

            "Bertram asks, &quot;but what about the breach? Who will go first? Or at the same time?&quot;",
            "I think of the flare gun, and how it&apos;s the only tool for communication we have. &quot;Pax will perform quick recon from behind the target. And he&apos;ll fire depending on where the hostages are. If they&apos;re concentrated on the right side of the house, his flare will fire to that side. Same for left. And if he can&apos;t tell, he&apos;ll fire straight up.&quot;",
            "&quot;And how does firing the flare like that change our strategy?&quot; Pax asks.",
            "&quot;Because the first team to breach will be the side without the hostages, drawing them away,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Brilliant,&quot; Naya says. &quot;No wonder you came up with most of our plan last time&mdash;minus the gold stripe.&quot;",
            "&quot;And what will I do after?&quot; Pax asks.",
            "&quot;You join the last breaching party.&quot; I say. &quot;The one that will have the best shot.&quot;",
            "&quot;And if it&apos;s straight-up?&quot; He asks.",
            "&quot;Then you either break into the middle from a third breach point directly behind, or make your own judgement call.&quot;",
            "&quot;Ready!&quot; Aldrin shouts, and I feel fear fill all the gaps and uncertainties in my plan like water fills a glass of ice. All the months I spent outside the base. All the combat practice drop-ins I missed. The space between the decrepit buildings begin to look like the shadows behind the sickly trees: a pattern of missing information that should be a second home to me, if only I wasn&apos;t so pathetic in my fear of the lands beyond.",
            "All these thoughts blitz through my mind in the time the distant blue flare denotes their readiness to defend. And when Pax angles the first flare shell, taking the second one into his pocket, I feel the fear that restrained me in front of the carriage almost wholly consume my edge.",

Current design is three brackets to hold the battery.&quot; I gesture to the contours of the 3D view, trying not to reveal the sweat that&apos;s saturated my armpits. &quot;And in those lines there, there&apos;s a reference to where it mounts on the machine.&quot; I pull at my collar, feeling beads of sweat trickle down the back of my neck. &quot;Three holes.

I want to tell them that I was excited to see their reactions from the moment I considered this, challenging myself to get this down to a single part and pulling through in the end. But all I can do is stand there and take it &mdash; like being a pledge in the fraternity again, bludgeoned by broken rules when my works should at least be acknowledged.",

            "Another cloud of blue chalk saturates the air as my heart jumps into my throat, followed by two more blasts from her rifle. And as Bertram returns to home base, his hands raised in reluctant surrender, I wipe the faint blue mist from my face, trying to decide what to do next.",
            "Aryn directly calls out to me, sending gooseflesh down my arms and legs. I&apos;m unsure whether it&apos;s her tone, or how afraid I am of the thrashing I&apos;ll receive at the end of this. ",

I hear the blasts echo from behind, running in a zig-zag pattern like a hare evading the jaws of a predator. Blue chalk accents the walls to the left and right. Aryn shouts something else, but I&apos;m unable to hear her when my heartbeat pounds in my ears, drawing raspy breaths that taste like poison as the breach point approaches.",

And although his design looks really cool&mdash;with even the company logo laser-etched into one of the faces- the design doesn&apos;t have a single sharp edge, defaulting to the rounds called fillets that are a bitch-and-a-half for machinists.",

The laser etching somewhere a laser couldn&apos;t reach? The surface finish? The stacked tolerances? The unmarked dimensions? The fact that this thing is over-engineered so evidently for aesthetics over function?",

It&apos;s still vastly overcrowded with criticisms I jotted down for myself than ones for Reed, but I feel something inside usher the words without being able to stop them.

But I don&apos;t have a golden spoon up my ass like you do, and I don&apos;t have a sympathetic audience to turn their words in my favor.&quot; I rip the badge from the retractable reel on my work pants. Work pants that my shirt was actually tucked in to, because I hoped that today would be different, because I let that stupid feeling inform my actions again. &quot;If you&apos;re not going to give me a fair shot, and if the only thing that matters is who I know, then why the hell am I even here?&quot;",

            "And then the words leave my mouth without the wherewithal to stop them. ",
            "&quot;We were ambushed. Bertram and I. We tried to put up a fight&mdash;&quot;",
            "&quot;But where are they?&quot; Pax asks. &quot;Where are the hostages?&quot;",
            "Naya says, &quot;we went right while Bertram and Katiya went left. And Paxton went around.&quot;",
            "The only conclusion left is preposterous. &quot;That&apos;s an incredible wager,&quot; I say. &quot;You&apos;re telling me...&quot;",
            "&quot;If they get to the red flag, it&apos;s over!&quot; Paxton shouts, retrieving the training rifle from his back. &quot;We need to rush them!&quot;",
            "And just then, the blue team&apos;s flare takes its turn illuminating the battlefield.",
            "&quot;They have the advantage &mdash; what&apos;s happening?&quot; Naya asks, her tail frayed with apprehension. &quot;It&apos;s three versus three, and they have a straight shot to victory.&quot;",
            "&quot;They&apos;re not going for an easy victory. Aryn isn&apos;t going to leave any of us alive,&quot; I say.",
            "The blue flare feathers out, leaving us in the wake of its ambient glow. &quot;So what are we going to do?&quot; Paxton asks. &quot;Whatever they&apos;re doing, they&apos;re doing!&quot; They turn to me: our two other confident tacticians are dead.",
            "I idle. &quot;But how did they get around?&quot; I ask.",
            "&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter. Get to the windows,&quot; Pax says, and shamefully, I begin to untie the bandanna from my head.",
            "&quot;Stop,&quot; Naya says, grasping my hand with her claws. &quot;There&apos;s no time to denigrate yourself.&quot; And then the quiet one gives me orders. &quot;Get to the center window.&quot;",
            "&quot;Alright,&quot; I say, resting the barrel of the red-powder rifle against what remains of the windowsill. We hear the thunder of rocks resounding against any metallic surface. The three sound like an army of hundreds coming to cleanse us from this battlefield, and as I sit at the window, I can&apos;t help but feel like that same petrified girl that once listened at the window, until one day her nightmare came true.",
            "And, just then, I hear a blast from the south.",
            "&quot;I got one,&quot; Naya exclaims, but just as she&apos;s about to turn to face me, a loud blast from beyond powders her spotted fur with blue dust, casting her towards the wall away from the window.",
            "The clatter of stones and pebbles accelerates like a hailstorm of bullets against steel, brass, and bronze, as if the Gods themselves cast their judgement on my cowardice from above. The maddening, raucous clatter crescendoes as Paxton takes up arms at the rear windowsill.",
            "&quot;They&apos;re behind us!&quot; He shouts. A round rips through his window, decorating the back wall with blue powder that darkens from the cloud of ash and dust, only inches from my head. &quot;Run for the red flag, Katiya, it&apos;s the only way you can save this. Touch the hostages. Save our&mdash;&quot;",
            "He takes a round to the chest, and it hardly staggers him. Two more crackle off his chest armor, and before my mind can interpret the death of my last misled comrade, I leap through the window, evading a maelstrom of blue-powder rounds as I fire blindly, decorating the sky and ground and walls with red.",
            "I&apos;m running down the same thoroughfare as the weakening reflection of Aldrin&apos;s eyeglass observes me. There is no space for reason when my heart is in my throat, along with my lungs, and running straight for the front with my rifle leveled, I feel myself pull the trigger at the first figure that emerges from the corner.",
            "The figure crumples, falling to the ground as they wheeze, grasping their unarmored chest. Aldrin&apos;s reflection catches the bright green linen they&apos;re wearing, with a thick weave of gambeson armor on the top.",
            "&quot;Hostage down,&quot; Aldrin exclaims, and riding the fumes of bitter resentment, my mind concludes the rest of the hostages are around the corner. ",
            "The rounds keep whizzing, grazing, and missing, displacing the air around me, not a single one contacting me loll as I turn the corner to touch as many hostages as I can.",
            "But instead, I touch the cool breastplate of a soldier: one that lashes me to the ground with the wide face of her broadsword.",
            "&quot;You will never save anyone if you&apos;re always the last to respond, Katiya,&quot; Aryn says, glaring down at me with her piercing, slitted azure eyes. She raises her hand to stop the others from claiming victory prematurely, granting me the clemency to lift myself from the ground. And as my body crumples on another episode of public mortification, Aryn remains still and absolute, speaking with a voice and expression like one of Cody&apos;s automatons.",
            "&quot;Prove yourself to me. Prove to all of us that you&apos;re better than you act,&quot; Aryn says, as Jullian steps from behind her, unable to bring himself to look at me again. &quot;Fight me,&quot; she says: &quot;fight me and regain your honor!&quot;",
            "She takes a slash at me with the training sword at full force, and I deflect with the dagger in my left hand, barely able to catch her rounded edge with the hilt.",
            "My other hand withdraws the light, wooden sword from its sheath. The rest of the world fades to darkness as the sun sets behind the Purgatory Mountains, leaving only the searchlight that sketches a circle in the street.",
            "The dead approach from both sides, saturated in homogenous purple: the victims from the blue team; Bertram and Ryder and Naya and Pax; and the other active blue-team soldiers with their weapons still drawn.",
            "&quot;Show me you deserve to be here,&quot; she says. &quot;That you deserve Jullian. That you deserve a key and a home. That your presence isn&apos;t just an insult to all the ones that didn&apos;t make it!&quot; She hammers me with blows on every line, driving me further away from the trembling ring of light. My wordless rebuttal only lies in blocking her sword, as amethyst dust clouds the air. Every assault comes at full force in a furious flurry of slashes, without the inefficiency of hesitation. ",
            "Every strike is another scene that plays within: every evasion of the base; every quest spent meandering around the city; every time I turned down my friends that only wished to challenge me from a place of love. ",
            "I&apos;m driven further out of the ring: to a premature death, towards my colleagues that cower in secondhand shame. ",
            "But in her mechanical string of attacks is an absence of variation. ",
            "It&apos;s a pattern. ",
            "Like the pistons of touring cars, her strokes land all the same, and when I draw on the flood of emotion that immolates me from within, I find the faintest opening. ",
            "A creative force of Essenced energy flushes my circuits with one last spark of intention. The maroon dust clouds shimmer with notes of blasting powder. Between blows as I&apos;m drawn to the absolute edge, I let my hands scald with the energy of life and fire. And when she lunges for a final blow, I ignite the air and dive behind her, closing my eyes as the blinding flash stuns her.",
            "I level my sword to strike, catching her in an unprecedented moment of weakness. I turn to face Aron as she reflexively wipes her eyes, my strike committed and absolute, but just as I&apos;m about to deal Aryn&apos;s death, a close-range slug of blue powder explodes against my back, sending me directly in to her as we both sprawl outside the circle.",
            "&quot;Drill is over,&quot; Aldrin shouts. &quot;Blue defenders win four-to one.&quot; ",
            "I turn my head to find the rule-breaker that blasted me at close range, and I find Jullian standing there. Maybe his glance is one of pity, or maybe it&apos;s fear. Or maybe it&apos;s relief &mdash; from how his jealousy resists any motion I make towards redemption.",
            "My body lacks the strength to stand up, but Aryn finds her footing. She hesitates to extend a hand, offering one last string of words before Jullian braces her, taking her arm over his shoulder as another one of her teammates approaches.",
            "&quot;You will never save anyone like this, Katiya,&quot; she says. &quot;You&apos;re worse than Rayna. And you&apos;ll die faster than she did.&quot;",
            "&quot;I saved Rayna,&quot; I mutter, but it&apos;s too quiet for her to hear. ",
            "&quot;You will always be a victim,&quot; Aryn says. &quot;And to think you were my inspiration.&quot;",
            "Bertram and Paxton lift me by the arms as Ryder draws the Essence to mend my minor scrapes. I hear Aldrin&apos;s voice call for me to approach overhead as they carry me towards the wooden elevator, grasping the railing as they pull me from the battlefield to become an observer of the grand map.",
            "&quot;I&apos;m not sure why you chose to wear that headband,&quot; Aldrin says.",
            "&quot;I had a plan,&quot; I tell him. &quot;I had a great plan.&quot;",
            "&quot;But you were late! You cowered, and hid, and had Bertram here dragging you like he is just now. You&apos;re a casualty. A piece of twine that guises as a steel link in the chain,&quot; he spits, &quot;and a leader that waits until it&apos;s safe. Leaders don&apos;t wait!&quot;",
            "&quot;I . . . but I &mdash;&quot;",
            "&quot;I&apos;ve given you so much leeway, Katiya. You have talent, but Gods be damned, why are you even here?&quot;",
            "I choke back tears to withdraw the words. &quot;Because I have a dream,&quot; I say. &quot;I had a dream. To save someone. To save anyone. To make my family&apos;s death and all that pain mean something! Or else . . . &quot;",
            "&quot;Well, you&apos;re below the line, Katiya,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;The first one this term. And I KNOW you have it in you.&quot;",
            "&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;",
            "&quot;I need to see a whole success from you, from start to finish. No hesitation!&quot;",
            "&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;",
            "&quot;And more patrol quests than domestic quests.&quot;",
            "&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;",
            "&quot;You have until next test to prove yourself.&quot;",
            "&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Or else . . .&quot; His words trail off.",
            "&quot;Yes, sir&quot; I add.",
            "&quot;And here.&quot; He withdraws a small envelope from a folder, extending it to me. &quot;You haven&apos;t been to the mail room in ages. This has been sitting there for a while. You&apos;ve got a letter from your family: hopefully it can act as motivation.&quot;",
            "Maybe it&apos;s just another check-in card, another undeserved pulse of praise from afar.  But I quickly realize it&apos;s something substantive from the weight.",
            "When I remove my left arm from Bertram, slicing back the top of the envelope with my dagger, I find a dense pack of pages. My eyes scan the first lines of my mother Stella&apos;s stationery. ",
            "The date was a month-and-a-half ago. ",
            "And my stomach drops further when I read the first lines of the long letter."

            "Sometimes this numbness can be a blessing in the same way that it&apos;s a curse. ",
            "It&apos;s a curse that makes tearful graduation speeches from my father sound like lectures from a professor. It makes moments of intimacy with the woman I thought I I&apos;d end up with feel like a meaningless hookup. But in moments of toleration &mdash; whether it&apos;s the long, dragging pledge process, an hour-and-a-half waiting for a new license at the DMV, or the verbal lashing I received from Naveen &mdash; the curse can be a blessing. ",
            "I observed myself from the corner of the room just like I do in every situation, fully detached from the experience like I&apos;m reading my own story, like the words are already written on the page and I&apos;m anticipating what comes next.",
            "All I know is that I&apos;m not getting fired. I&apos;ve spent most of this car ride home just trying to locate the debris inside me, thumbing through flesh for the fragments from my explosion.",
            "But I don&apos;t think anything is there.",
            "Either my soul is too calloused, or its affects phased right through me, just like all the other acts of love when feeling and setting aren&apos;t aligned by chance.",
            "Cody was sitting in the dimly-lit room with the shades drawn. He was called in there from his desk by his boss, before the others could return from the meeting. He was certain he was being fired, but he found the strangest sense of relief in the idea of starting from scratch, no matter the pain of what that process entailed, or the dangers of that mortgage for the interdimensional house he took out in his name.",
            "But he quickly found that the lashing almost felt like a formality. ",
            "The punches felt they were being driven by something else: weak and auxiliary, like catching blows from a marionette. Naveen said the leadership decided to go with Reed&apos;s design, and despite all the effort he put into it, channeling everything he learned only to be told to discard everything he learned, he realized that all he could do was just ride out the slow swell of mediocrity.",
            "Maybe Reed really is better than me. Maybe Kei really does deserve someone better. And maybe all that someone like me can aspire to is just to mull around designing batteries and fixtures for the rest of my life.",
            "Maybe I am that second type of engineer,",
            " I think to myself. ",
            "Maybe I&apos;m the type that digs a foxhole into a single forgotten field, while the rare few are able to ride their passion. Have I ever been passionate? Why did I even choose this in the first place?",
            "All I know is that the anger is still there. It&apos;s hot and uncomfortable, and when my foot sinks the pedal to the floor, apathetic to that pointless, abandoned light at the bottom of the hill, I blast directly through the red without any observers. I pound the wheel. I scream as loud as I possibly can with the windows down and the wind at eighty miles per hour and climbing rushing past my face, shouting obscenities and trying to let it out though the discomfort is still there, thinking that if I coax it out by going through the motions of people who feel, that I might find its release.",
            "But all I have is speed, and the feeling of inertia when the car jostles over the uneven hill before the highway, forcing me to slam my brakes so I don&apos;t flip off the on-ramp. My fingers tension the rubber wheel, ruing this feeling of internal anguish and the fear of what comes after when I return to the office. Maybe the enclosure design failed for bureaucratic reasons, but I still have the battery project. And maybe I just have to impress them so much that they can&apos;t help but promote me: to acknowledge the talent I KNOW I have inside me.",
            "But no. That&apos;s the feeling of hope again. ",
            "Maybe I all I have is just to do it at minimal effort, and pass time like all the others in my company that settled early."

            "Cody pulls in the garage a little after 17:30. I hope it&apos;s excitement that brought him home so quickly: maybe to relay the news, that the presentation gave him everything he ever wanted. I was happy to be a spectator for his rehearsal this morning, though I wasn&apos;t listening to a word of it. It wasn&apos;t because I didn&apos;t care. It was less because I didn&apos;t understand, and more from rising panic over the demands of my competency test.",
            "I couldn&apos;t stand to stand or sit or lie down in my own home, to relish in so much as a square cubit of undeserved space. It felt as if the ground might vanish beneath me if I put too much weight on it, and thusly, I retreated past the threshold to rest in the calmness of Cody&apos;s world.",
            "I sit on his couch in comfort clothes that he gave me a couple weeks ago: cozy pajama pants in a strange black-and-red pattern that Cody tells me is reminiscent of tree-cutters &mdash; called jacks of lumber or something &mdash; and a thin, cotton shirt that&apos;s tight around the chest, reading SHALEBOROUGH RENAISSANCE FAIRE. With nothing but time to waste, I try to thumb through the device he got me, wondering how it could fit all the literature of his world in so small a space.",
            "The garage closes. And the door bursts open as if he were kicking it for a breaching drill. His face is red, and his eyes are red, but it doesn&apos;t look like he was crying. The crescents of his eyes are worn deeper than I&apos;ve ever seen them, unshouldering his bag pack as he covers his face with his hands, letting out a loud exhale.",
            "&quot;So what happened?&quot; I ask: it&apos;s what asked me when my world first fell apart.",
            "&quot;Everything,&quot; he mutters. I watch his body sink onto one of the barstools. Then he settles for the floor, crumpled with his head resting in his hands.  &quot;I&apos;m pretty sure I lost everything,&quot; he says, &quot;or I lost everything at the start, and only now, I&apos;m realizing what&apos;s gone.&quot;",
            "He&apos;s distraught, but I find a strength in his weakness that&apos;s entirely absent from my world. A strength to lose races for friendship. To make jokes. To bleed publicly. And despite the anguish of all my shortcomings, I find the overwhelming desire to do nothing but protect him: because I think he&apos;s the only person I&apos;ve met who understands.",
            "And I try, one last time, to draw out those feelings from within myself.",
            "I rise from the couch to join him on the floor. &quot;I wonder which of us had it worse,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;I found out my company doesn&apos;t need me,&quot; he says, and instead of heaving breaths that will surely lead him to a panic attack, the sentence provides enough pause to slow his breathing.",
            "The thought of Jullian makes me hesitate to touch him: maybe it&apos;s because of the fear of being hurt; that I&apos;m still trying to reconcile how something so great can devolve into apathy. The rules are still taped to the door: the last one circled several times in impossibly bright yellow ink.",
            "&quot;I found out that my &apos;company&apos; might be better without me, too,&quot; I say, focusing my eyes on his face until he decides to turn and face me, but he still hides with his head in his hands: ears red with tufts of short brown hair displaced by his fingers.",
            "I want so badly to touch him.",
            "&quot;And what did you do?&quot; He asks.",
            "&quot;I failed an examination. A very critical one. They said I was too weak. That I&apos;ll never save anyone. And then I lost to my rival in a humiliating way,&quot; I say, and I sniffle.",
            "&quot;They showed me that I&apos;ll never be good enough. All they care about is the ones that play the game. But I had a shit hand to start,&quot; Cody says. &quot;So my dad is a technician? The union are just scabs for corporate guys to pick off one by one.&quot;",
            "&quot;And weakness of any kind is a malady. And my past keeps getting in the way,&quot; I tell him. My head sinks slowly until it&apos;s about to rest on his shoulder.",
            "&quot;At least you had a chance to fight,&quot; Cody says. &quot;My struggle was fixed from the start.&quot;",
            "&quot;Oh, please. At least you didn&apos;t have to fight with your fists,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Fight?&quot; It&apos;s the first time he flashes his dark brown eyes at me. &quot;Violence isn&apos;t the only incisive way to shred a person&apos;s soul. I spent three years trying day-in and day-out.&quot;",
            "&quot;And I tried just like you,&quot; I say, sternly, discomforted by a new hole for my anger that I haven&apos;t the time to suture shut. I know what he means, but the words leave anyway. &quot;What, you think it&apos;s all just in my head?&quot;",
            "&quot;In your head? What are you talking about? Your struggle is actual violence. I&apos;m just saying professional death can hurt, too,&quot; he says, slowly sliding away from me.",
            "&quot;I never said it couldn&apos;t,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;I know. I&apos;m just saying you have the agency to change things. To choose what image you fight for,&quot; Cody says, &quot;but . . .&quot;",
            "&quot;So you are saying it&apos;s all in my head!&quot; I exclaim, rising from the floor to look down on him. &quot;Tell me, is your family dead? Were you the victim of unfathomable violence that scarred you in places you&apos;ll never be able to find?&quot;",
            "&quot;No,&quot; Cody says, standing up as he backs against the icebox, nearly tripping over his bag. &quot;I&apos;m sorry, Katiya, I misspoke. I mean that&mdash;&quot;",
            "&quot;You weren&apos;t even there when your brother died. He&apos;s more of a warrior in any sense than you&apos;ll ever be,&quot; I hear myself say, balling my fists until my nails might break the flesh on my palms, and I feel the unfairness of all the world exit my mind wholly through the keyhole of my mouth. &quot;How do you get better at sitting in a box?&quot;",
            "&quot;Fuck you,&quot; he says. &quot;What are you going to do, Wonder Woman? Stab me again?&quot; He pushes a buttering knife across the counter, confident enough to know I won&apos;t use it.",
            "A sliver of me relents for an apology, for how messed up the words are that left my mouth. I piece together the first words to even begin to tell Cody that I&apos;m sorry, to try to mend this, because I feel a different feeling still drawing me closer to him, almost strong enough to overcome the white hot rage.",
            "Cody says, &quot;Your father died before he could teach you how to chill the fuck out. And that&apos;s not my goddamned fault.&quot;",
            "&quot;At least I try,&quot; I say. &quot;You don&apos;t even try at all! You&apos;re a coward, so struck by a death you didn&apos;t even witness that you give yourself permission&mdash;&quot;",
            "&quot;&mdash;and all you do is no different,&quot; Cody says. &quot;They were right. You won&apos;t save anyone if you can&apos;t even leave your town!&quot;",
            "The knife on the counter tempts me. But it&apos;s the other unfamiliar feeling that tempers me. &quot;This was a mistake to ever think I could depend on you,&quot; I tell him. I tear the power cord from the wall, tugging and tugging and tugging it from my world along with the meager array of appliances that crash as they fall from the counters. The hot box. The toasting unit. The charger for the smartphone. And the power strip.",
            "He tries to say something, but it gets lost in the raucous clatter. With a final tug, all the life-softening devices cross the threshold, and I kick a toaster that blocks the door across the kitchen.",
            "&quot;I hope one day you can be stronger than the pathetic weakness that is legion in your world. Your brother would be ashamed of what you&apos;ve become.&quot; I hurl the smartphone in his direction, but without the strength to hurt.",
            "And his words are the last I hear before the door slams shut forever.",
            "&quot;And, and don&apos;t come crying to me again. I won&apos;t be there. I mean it! I&mdash;&quot;",
            "I slam the door, scalding the new handle until it&apos;s unusable: the handle that Cody installed after the second time I crossed over. The threshold closes for a final time. No longer will that avenue of solace be open to me, because all I have left is to purge every trace of weakness from my process.",
            "For my family this time.",
            "Maybe Cody is right in his approach. Maybe he&apos;s right to extinguish his sense of spirit when nothing ever comes of it. And maybe that wrenching feeling of discomfort will become a new home for me, when I&apos;m doing all scouting quests instead of slothing around the town of Gaffesend raking leaves and guarding potatoes.",
            "I hear a thunk on the other side: something contacts his door after he slams it. Maybe it&apos;s his head. And maybe he&apos;s sitting there too. And maybe there&apos;s a chance I have to say something.",
            "It&apos;s the new feeling he gave me that almost entirely overpowers that experience of fear in speaking up. The one I got when he stood up to Jullian, and the one I find when he flashes that stupid smug grin of his when he says something provocative. It&apos;s the same feeling I got when I received the letter from Aldrin: I panicked more at the ramification of my mother&apos;s words than the failures in my training.",
            "I open my mouth with the hopes that something will come out to rectify this, to yell across the door, but I decide to push those feelings down. They&apos;re feelings that have only gotten me into trouble, because I can&apos;t be the perfect soldier like Aryn: no wonder Jullian and all my friends are over me.",
            "Instead, I reach for the letter sitting on the low table, reading and rereading and rereading the first set of lines again and again, wondering when I&apos;ll have to meet them, and what I&apos;ll say when I pay them a visit.",
            "It was dated a month-and-a-half ago.",
            " DEAREST KATIYA,",
            "NEXT MONTH, WE WILL BE MOVING TO GAFFESEND, ENTRUSTING THE SAFETY OF OUR FAMILY TO THE STEADFAST BRAVERY OF OUR CHILDREN."

            "It&apos;s the cold snap that brings him back again.",
            "The cold snap of steel-on-steel on the press-check as he sits in the starboard door seat of the helicopter, just fiddling with it at this point, having recited the words and pictures of the plan a hundred times over.",
            "The six-man patrol of an Army long-range surveillance detachment flies under the cover of darkness in the predawn hours, kept awake by the thrum of the rotor &mdash; and the talk of anything that might distract them. First it was family, then to food, then it devolved to getting Keller to retell the story of his &quot;favorite worst pregnancy scare.&quot;",
            "But now the conversation is anywhere else, and instead of Helten delivering another sobering recitation of the plan, Gjersee decides to start a war.",
            "He rubs his mustache. &quot;You fuckers don&apos;t even know what good food is. My mom makes the best food. Her enchiladas are amazing, passed town from my abuela.&quot;",
            "&quot;Best she can make from the Dollar General,&quot; Dunsmore says, dragging the large Pelican case out from beneath the seat. &quot;You people are almost as bad as India in thinking spice equals flavor.&quot;",
            "&quot;You take that back,&quot; Gjersee groans.",
            "&quot;I&apos;ll take it back after you try my dad&apos;s tri-tip. He&apos;s a beast on the grill, even makes his own barbecue sauce.&quot;",
            "&quot;Please,&quot; Gjersee says. &quot;We add a tenth as much spice as the sugar your white whales dust on their pancakes,&quot; he says. And then he turns to Aberbook, sparing no-one in the free for all. &quot;At least it&apos;s better than this guy &mdash; he can&apos;t  taste anything his mom makes, because anything that tastes like something isn&apos;t Kroger.&quot;",
            "&quot;Kroger?&quot; Aberbook asks.",
            "&quot;Yeah, Kroger,&quot; Gjersee says.",
            "Keller leans in. &quot;Like Costco? So you&apos;re saying she only buys frozen stuff?&quot;",
            "&quot;No, jackass. Kroger &mdash; like the Jews can eat it.&quot;",
            "&quot;That&apos;s Kosher, you idiot,&quot; Aberbook says, and they share a laugh over the comms. &quot;I bet the highlight of your life was the day you won a shirt at the Army pull-up challenge at your high school. The day you realized you were only as good as a GED!&quot;",
            "Gjersee searches for words. And Dunsmore leans in to add: &quot;He&apos;s calling you stupid, if you can&apos;t put that together. A GED is the piece of paper you were supposed to get at...&quot;",
            "&quot;Enough!&quot; Gjersee kicks his boot against the Pelican case. &quot;Play with your stupid toy. You&apos;re a nerd like your brother.&quot;",
            "&quot;Don&apos;t talk shit about Cody,&quot; Jackson says, as he unclips the latches around the top cover, revealing the smooth contours of the RQ-11B Raven drone recessed in the die-cut foam. He frowns when his fingers touch the chassis, feeling the coldness of the metal despite the seven hand warmers pinched between incisions in the foam.",
            "Aberbook squints his eyes when he looks down at the drone. &quot;Say, Jackie, did you plug that thing into the wall last night, or did you forget?&quot;",
            "&quot;It&apos;s not that,&quot; he says, taking the battery pack underneath his arm. &quot;She&apos;s  more of a warm-weather girl. Prefers the sandbox over the tundra.&quot;",
            "&quot;Is it still on full charge?&quot;",
            "Dunsmore taps the controller, lighting four green bars. The fourth bark flickers. Then a voice cracks over the radio. ",
            "&quot;SITREP on infil. Two mikes out.&quot;",
            "Team Leader Helten raises two gloved fingers before he flicks off the cabin lights. &quot;Two and closing. We&apos;ll be Oscar Mike as soon as we touch down. Check white light: we&apos;re going dark.&quot;",
            "&quot;Going dark,&quot; Dunsmore recites, and flicks off the muzzle light he was using to inspect the position of the latches. And after the fumbles over locking the last three, he slides it beneath the seat: closing his eyes, trying to remember how this moment rhymes with the helicopter tour he took in Maui, convincing himself that the biting cold is similar to the numbness of bright sunshine flooding through the window as they descend into the valley of the landing zone.",
            "The dream ends when the door slides open. Synthetic daylight glows green in his night-vision goggles. He removes all his belongings faster than a civilian on a short layover: dismounting the rumbling steel chassis to plant his boots in the dry snow.",
            "It&apos;s after the six disembark that the blades accelerate, and moments later, the helicopter is gone, disappearing rapidly into the cover of night, leaving the six skilled foreigners with their feet planted two hundred miles inside a foreign land.",
            " &quot;We&apos;re Oscar Mike,&quot; Helten says, urging his team to motion. &quot;We&apos;re ten klicks out from observation point Alpha: right on the ridgeline of the suspected logistics hub. And we&apos;ve got about an hour of dark to get there and set up.&quot;",
            "But they&apos;re well-conditioned despite the burly camouflaged coats and protective gear: each hauling a load of equipment. In Desert Storm, it was hours spent suffocating in gas-resistant NBC suits under the punishing sun, but even with the alpine cold and constant snowfall, the ache of muscles and thinness of the mountain air makes it feel just as exhausting.",
            "Helten tells his team to &quot;stay frosty&quot; when they break the summit of the first ridge, and Gjersee reminds him that they already are. They walk in a single-file line, compressed by heel and toe so that the snow fills in faster. The others seem alright, but Dunsmore feels his panic rise over the contents of the case.",
            "&quot;How much further, Helten?&quot; Dunsmore mutters.",
            "&quot;About three klicks out. Why, you got somewhere to be?&quot;",
            "&quot;No. I&apos;m not asking for me.&quot; Dunsmore gestures to the case. &quot;Some of us can&apos;t stand the cold like humans do.&quot;",
            "&quot;Then we&apos;ll launch shortly after establishing our position,&quot; Helten says.",
            "Dunsmore tensions his grasp against the handle, as if he could transfer the rest of his meager surplus of heat. He requisitioned an extra battery, trying to warm it inside his coat as his other hand carries the case, trudging between the sharp needles of unfamiliar trees as Helten heads their caravan."
         ],
         "Chapter 26 Scene 2": [
            "The sun foreshadows dawn with a hint of deep red, but the cloud cover still saturates the sky, offering an extra hour of absolute darkness, and in that time, a long thirty minutes pass until they arrive.",
            "They pick a fold of the landscape that gives eyes to the valley, but still masked by the shadows of the western slope. Helten runs micro-recon on wind direction and snow density, muttering coordinates in MGRS as Dunsmore transcribes them into the tablet. Gjersee and Aberbook unroll the camo cover to thaw against the brush, setting a tarp down in an odd recession of the ridge that masks the mast as just another continuation of its rocky edge.",
            "Chemlights are planted in the snow with the glow facing down, and the infrared strobes are tested: only visible as a green shimmer on their night vision goggles.",
            "It&apos;s hard enough to set up camp when Jackson dedicates so much of his focus to warming the heart of the drone, reminding him of the battery on his GameBoy Advance back in middle school, when his family took ski trips to the mountains and his brother Cody hoarded the console for too long.",
            "He finds the courage to peek at the power level indicator: two lights out of four, and it hits him with a panic. It&apos;s been nearly five minutes since setup and the camo tarp already bows under the weight of the fat flakes, and though it blends them further into the landscape, Gjersee works to gently shake off the residual clumps of sticky snow.",
            "Jackson&apos;s hands feel so slow when he withdraws the Raven&apos;s controller, cracking open the pelican case for one last time as he steadies the small machine in his hands. He snaps the battery into its slot as Aberbook watches &mdash; steadying the drone in one hand like his father Alan once did with the model plane at the park.",
            "And in one smooth throw from behind cover, tangent to the perimeter of the logistics hub, the engine whirs to life, climbing as the small, matte, metal bird struggles to settle in the slipstream of the valley&apos;s wind lane, scanning with its watchful eye.",
            "Helten records this stage in his logbook: 0428 / INFIL COMPLETE / OP ALPHA ESTABLISHED. Above their heads, the silent drone slices the precipitous air with its long, curved wings, and even higher, Overwatch listens for every word of their transmissions, transcribing their reports to the last surviving record of OPERATION BLUEWINGS.",
            "The team settles in absolute silence against sleepless shadow. Jackson flies the grid as the rest of the team stakes the sectors and posts observers.",
            "The heavy gusts knock the Raven sideways as it tries to stabilize. Without the feedback of the whir overhead &mdash; or a haptic sense of the drone&apos;s disturbances &mdash; Jackson Dunsmore feels deprived of critical senses that might allow him to steady the small machine that&apos;s bullied and buffeted about the sky. ",
            "He holds a breath until the thin air burns his lungs. The console&apos;s power indicator flicks down to the second bar, and the wind is getting stronger, covering the display with flakes of snow that are too cold to condense.  And as the Raven approaches for its first pass over the logistics hub, the first signatures of enemy life illuminate the screen: far more dots of white-hot heat than they anticipated.",
            "&quot;I&apos;m counting at least twenty tangos on the ground,&quot; Jackson mutters. It was supposed to be just several men that were sustaining the supply line, and he doesn&apos;t have to infer what that means to the other four of them. There were rumors of his presence in the area, and whether this was an act of God or unfortunate coincidence, the discovery overwrites the assumptions of their plan, and how well-defended this compound might be.",
            "Helten transcribes the discovery that sends an even colder chill through all of them. &quot;Overwatch, confimation of HVT present in facility.&quot;",
            "But there&apos;s no reply. Dunsmore eyes the rubber antenna pointing like a tiny flag into the darkness.",
            "&quot;Overwatch, do you copy?&quot;",
            "And as the wind accelerates, casting an array of blinding flakes that vanish their operating point into a room of white, Dunsmore struggles to distinguish anything through the drone&apos;s camera. The battery level flickers between one and empty, and only halfway over the logistics hub, his controls transfer over in slower and slower responses, like remotely driving a rover on the moon.",
            "He wants to curse, but the fear of violent crosswinds carrying his foreign words halt the words in his throat as his freezing hands tension further around the control sticks. It&apos;s then that the feed disconnects entirely, plunging the bright-green rectangle of the screen into darkness.",
            "LIVE FEED DISCONNECTED, it reads, though the vitals of the machine still come through. He drives blind by the accelerometer&apos;s roll, pitch, and yaw, panic-stricken by the precipitous pitch that tells it&apos;s pointed forty-five degrees down, like a surface-to-air missile without a payload.",
            "Aberbook mutters something to him, but he&apos;s too lost in panic: far from staying frosty when his mind is ablaze, struck with the decision whether to level the drone above the enemy&apos;s heads in audible detection range, or plunge it straight into the ground to stop the sound.",
            "Then tthe feed flicks back: only for moments, flashing with the white-hot ruminations of a gathering of tangos, so close that he can distinguish the heat from each of their fingers. ",
            "Fate makes the decision for him when the power cuts out. The drone accelerometer coughs one last string of readings: so steep the absolute position is lost in gimbal lock.",
            "And over the console:",
            "Jackson&apos;s throat goes dry as the tablet flashes red. &quot;Viper Six to Overwatch &mdash; Viper Six to Overwatch, come in. Raven is down . . .&quot; his mind fumbles for the recited coordinates &quot; . . . Raven is down, grid 13T VH 679 334. TIC. Request QRF/CASEVAC. Over.&quot;",
            "Static eats the end of his sentence: white and granular like the snow, and moments later, the base&apos;s alarm blares loud enough to fight the headwind, radiating the air with flashes of red.",
            "Now thirty sets of enemy eyes scan the ridge, expecting them, with far better equipment than their team could carry on foot. Tracer rounds radiate the snow in streaks of red, punching the crust of the ridge as the team coalesces behind the barrier, their only line to Overwatch severed by the brutal storm."
         ],
         "Chapter 26 Scene 3": [
            "&quot;This is all my fault,&quot; Dunsmore mutters. His voice trembles: their LRF detachment wasn&apos;t intended for combat, and six M4 rifles against the concentrated might of the enemy feels like lobbing stones at an M1 Abrams tank.",
            "&quot;You can&apos;t control the weather,&quot; Gjersee mutters, just as the shrill sound of snowmobile engines undercuts the whine of the alarm. But Dunsmore eyes the antenna, allowing shame to stir his emotions towards an act of courage. ",
            "Helten urges them to move. Keller keeps trying the comms, but to no avail, and as they stumble up the wooded hills with aimless bullets whizzing overhead, they struggle to crest the summit.",
            "The belligerent snowstorm conceals their forms, directed now only by the sense of &quot;toward&quot; and &quot;away&quot;. Somewhere below, the snowmobile engines cut off as the enemy follows their footprints, firing volleys uphill as Aberbook takes over trying the radio.",
            "&quot;Viper Six to Overwatch, Viper Six to Overwatch,&quot; he says, breathlessly, as rounds eviscerate the bark of trees on their uphill climb. &quot;Request QRF/CASEVAC.&quot;",
            "And then static crackles over the radio, interspersed with the words of Overwatch. &quot;Repeat, Viper ... exfil ... activity ...&quot;",
            "Gjersee turns to Dunsmore. &quot;The signal is getting better: once we get up there, we just need a wi&mdash;&quot;",
            "The first round finds flesh instead of bark, stealing the words from Gjersee&apos;s throat. The punctuation is in the awful gasping sound as Gjersee chokes on blood, unable to breathe enough to continue his climb. Aberbook rushes over to grab him by the vest, dragging him up the hill as his other hand holds his medical provisions. They&apos;re so close to the crest of the hill, and as Dunsmore offers his other hand to help Gjersee as the life loosens from his limbs, the first coherent string of words rattles over the comms.",
            "&quot;Viper Six, provide SITREP. Viper Six ...&quot; and then the words retreat to static when the weather accelerates.",
            "Dunsmore is kept viscerally awake by awful sound of Gjersee next to him, as their medic Aberbook tries to tend him on the run. Helten and Keller stay several steps ahead and to the left, firing in bursts back downhill as covering fire.",
            "Dunsmore feels the sting of something hot in his left shoulder, so flooded with adrenaline that he barely registers it, still holding tightly to the antenna as a plan forms in his mind. In the frozen fog of war, the summit is only several steps away. But it&apos;s when they cross the threshold that their feet fail to find flat ground.",
            "They haven&apos;t the time to warn each other. Aberbook falls with his hand tensioned around Gjersee&apos;s collar. Dunsmore holds strong to the antenna as he cascades down a chute of stark land, feeling the texture of every rock and branch that isn&apos;t covered with powder, rolling as the strapped rifle flails violently, reaching with his arms for anything to stop him. He stops uphill of the others after several rolls, slamming his back against the bark of a tree, knocking the wind from his lungs in a cloud of exhale.",
            "He hears his comrades falling further as he inspects the antenna and the communications equipment: the last link his team has to Overwatch.",
            "&quot;Regroup,&quot; Helten manages over the comms. &quot;Regroup at the bottom for exfil.&quot;",
            "&quot;Negative,&quot; Jackson says, able to distinguish patches of land from his high point on the eastern slope. &quot;I&apos;m getting us a direct line to Overwatch with coordinates.&quot;",
            "&quot;They&apos;re right behind us,&quot; Keller says. &quot;That&apos;s suicide!&quot;",
            "&quot;We each have a job here,&quot; Dunsmore says. &quot;Mine is this. Now get the fuck away from here.&quot;",
            "He has just enough energy to get high enough on the summit. He parrots, over and over, until his elevation is just enough, as the enemy combatants come closer and closer, able to distinguish every syllable of their language through heaving breaths in the climb. The rifle is too defective to fire, but his handgun is still strapped across his chest, and he withdraws it after he makes it to the top.",
            "The adversary expects them to still be far. It was a couple snowmobiles that raced over here: maybe two tangos per machine, so maybe they&apos;re just a small detachment that took a stab in the dark.",
            "Jackson Dunsmore peeks over the edge as the sun barely peeks through the storm, just enough to distinguish their forms. The six climb the hill in a line, and Jackson&apos;s pistol is still topped off with fifteen rounds.",
            "He doesn&apos;t hesitate to pull the trigger: stabilized with his arms against the hard shell of his equipment. The first two rounds punch through the furthest targets: two headshots, painting the trees with red gray matter stickier than the sap, and when their panic makes them harder to target, Jackson turns the gun to the two closest, delivering two rounds to each of them: enough to cast them to the ground, rolling back downhill as they disappear from sight.",
            "He ducks back behind the ridge as several rounds whiz overhead from automatic weapons. He abandons the equipment for a brief moment as he slides along the edge towards the first two victims: hearing one voice become quiet and another become louder, surely commanding each other to &quot;split up.&quot;",
            "Jackson waits as he hears volleys of rounds from the eastern slope, and looking down, he finds the team far down and right, providing covering fire as a distraction, to edge them away from Jackson&apos;s position.",
            "Surely enough, the closest combatant turns to approach the other. Jackson hears his voice though he still hides behind the ridge, and when he stands up to fire his rifle, he doesn&apos;t expect a seventh.",
            "The trigger pull sounds off a blast in stereo: two simultaneous pulls at two different targets. And though the enemy in front of him collapses, Jackson feels a stinging pain in his chest as he falls to the ground, holding weakly to the summit&apos;s edge.",
            "He tastes and smells the iron in the air. It&apos;s too dark to distinguish the color fo what flows out in front of him, but the directive changes when he eyes the antenna sitting roughly twenty yards away. ",
            "Rounds from his friendlies blow eviscerate the seventh crouched behind him, and he hears a shrill scream as rifle rounds tear through the flesh of his attacker.  Past the antenna, the last survivor crouches behind the other edge, and as Dunsmore wills his fading body to approach, he reloads the M9 with a magazine: reaching for the first one to find the bullet blasted through his chest and out the center &mdash; then for the second one, removing the empty clip and trading it for another.",
            "The last enemy is injured, in a state of incontroverible panic &mdash; maybe just some low-ranked, dutiful base-dweller servicing snowmobiles and taking stock, and it shows in the spread of bullets. ",
            "He pulls the trigger in Jackson&apos;s direction until the mag runs out, pulling three, then four, then five times past the hollow click, reaching into his pockets for more. ",
            "But Jackson is faster. And when he raises the handgun, it takes just one pull for deliverance.",
            "The adversary collapses against the eastern face with part of his jaw missing, twitching before gravity reclaims him, casting him downhill like the rest of Jackson&apos;s team. And when he hears the second wave of reinforcements surely responding to the exchange, he rushes faster than his wounds will let him, steadying the antenna as he takes enough wind into his lungs to speak.",
            "&quot;Viper Six to Overwatch, Viper Six to Overwatch, SITREP.&quot;",
            "&quot;Solid copy, Viper Six,&quot; Jackson hears.",
            "&quot;This is Viper Six, patrol size: six. We are taking contact at grid 13T VH 678 342. Enemy dismounted, seven tangos down with reinforcements along the ridge to the west. Raven down at grid 13T VH 679 334. We are breaking east to rally point Delta. Two WIA. Request immediate QRF and MEDEVAC; priority CASEVAC, over.&quot;",
            "He can hear them getting closer: the second set of soldiers ascending the hill after they turn off their engines, then the sound of a helicopter approaching from the west.",
            "He speaks again.",
            "&quot;Viper six to Overwatch &mdash; repeat grid thirteen T, VH, six-seven-eight, three-four-two. Enemy moving into the old logging road. Do not clear fires over the valley until we&apos;re on the mark. Over.&quot;",
            "&quot;Copy,&quot; Overwatch says.",
            "Jackson loses his grasp on the edge. Darkness begins to swim around him: the long blood trail from south to north begins to glisten as light breaks through the storm.",
            "&quot;We&apos;re pulling . . . we&apos;re pulling . . . viper six out. Jackson, over.&quot; He fumbles with the transceiver when his hand can barely hold the button, but manages a final, dutiful breath to mutter one last string of words.",
            "But they aren&apos;t the ones that Aberbook&apos;s ghost writer wrote, nor were they the ones delivered in his eulogy. They weren&apos;t the ones misquoted in the Wahlberg movie that was based on the true story, either.",
            "In this nightmare, he looks up at me with our mother&apos;s eyes and father&apos;s nose, and asks the question to me directly."

            "The whole tree shakes. And when she knows the two younger twins are watching &mdash; Raph and Raven, who were brought along for their first adventure beyond the walls &mdash; she launches her slender body skyward, floating through the air like an ascendant Auvryan before she wraps her arms around the branch on the other side.",
            "&quot;Gods, Katiya,&quot; Bertram says, emasculated enough by the short-haired tomboy to force his stocky frame up to the second branch: death-gripping the veins of bark as the pit in his stomach seems to make him lighter.",

            "&quot;Am not!&quot; Bertram says, his voice trembling as he hugs the narrowing branch: high enough to drop-and-roll and pray to the Gods that he doesn&apos;t sprain an ankle if he slips. &quot;It&apos;s only because I&apos;m carrying all your dad&apos;s stuff you borrowed.&quot;",

To show Raph and Raven our treehouse, and put them to work?&quot;",

Since as early as he could remember, his parents regaled him with tales they bought from the old book shop in Gaffesend across the lake: tales of adventure, of courage and glory &mdash; so how could they get mad if he was living the same spirit of the dungeon-crawling adventurers a hundred years ago?",

            "&quot;You&apos;re right,&quot; Katiya says. She sighs. &quot;Maybe more wood-shop with my dad isn&apos;t so&mdash;&quot;",

She struggles to make eye contact, because it&apos;s something about their glare that discomforts her: their eyes all dark brown despite their different colors of hair, and just like the trees, he can almost convince himself he sees amethyst in the brown.",
            "&quot;But we&apos;re not the bad guys,&quot; one says, laughing a little longer than usual. &quot;The Chymaerans are big and purpley and thin, no?&quot;",

            "&quot;Like the elite ones, the Death Scouts. And they&apos;re trained for years and years and years,&quot; one of the others says, but then a girl strikes him in the chest. ",

            "&quot;If we win, then you have to let us play in the pond,&quot; Raph says. &quot;Dad says I can only swim if I have an adult. You can watch us. Can you push us in, like you did to your friends?&quot;",
            "They laugh. ",
            "&quot;Sure. We can go play in the pond, all right,&quot; the leader says. &quot;But what if you lose?&quot;",

            "&quot;I just . . . think that kids like to play to have fun. But,&quot; and he chooses the next words slowly, &quot;sometimes grown-ups don&apos;t play to win. Some of them only have fun when other people lose, and lose really, really hard.&quot;",

         "Chapter 27 Scene 2": [
            "At twenty-eight, Katiya and Bertram are already halfway across the field, stumbling over uneven patches of dirt as they run as fast as their bodies will let them. Raph and Raven are laughing gaily as they cross the threshold of the tree line at eighteen, followed by Katiya at fifteen, and Bertram at fourteen &mdash; choking on the rancid taste of exhaustion in his breath as he struggles to keep up.",
            "Nhytyx&apos;s voice gets louder after they break the edge of the field, and it sounds ever-present as if he whispers in their minds, accented with the faintest resonance of Chymaeran clicks, and at twelve, while their leader&apos;s voice crescendos with excitement, Katiya can barely distinguish their slender forms from the narrow shape of the trees. The distant, thin trunks of the bordering tree line sway with the wind, but a few of them seem to lean in the other direction.",
            "At ten, Katiya manages to clench her fingers around Raven&apos;s collar like a mother cat collecting wayward childen. His face drops when he sees the unfamiliar look of panic, and when Raph turns around, Bertram grabs him by the shoulders, releasing a shriek when he pins him against a tree.",
            "Bertram is inches from his face from six to four, spitting with each syllable. &quot;This is not a game,&quot; he says. &quot;You need to stop playing and fight for real.&quot;",
            "Raph pants. &quot;But&mdash;&quot;",
            "&quot;We&apos;re going to the treehouse,&quot; Katiya says, just as Nhytyx calls TWO. The unfamiliar chill assures her that they started running long before the count. She pulls Raven so hard that he&apos;s almost flagging behind her as she runs for the knotted rope ladder: it&apos;s not in sight yet, but she can feel the shape of the forest from twelve trips before.",
            "The sound of snapping twigs sounds behind her, but too far behind her, so she doesn&apos;t dare to turn around. All she can hear beyond the heartbeat in her ears are the last words she spoke to the twins&apos; parents, saying they&apos;d be out to play late, and not to worry, telling a bald-faced lie about some stupid game she made up on the spot, and they were stupid enough to believe her.",
            "And now they&apos;re too far to be saved by anyone. She thinks she can see obsidian shadows moving faster than her tiny legs in the corner of her eye, but her vision is too dry, and as the sweat burns and dries them even further, she can only run on the newfound feeling of panic that overwhelms her.",
            "But she made a promise, and she&apos;s going to protect them. They&apos;re going to climb up the treehouse and go from there. They&apos;re going to climb up the tree and&mdash;",
            "Where is it?",
            "She stops. Anticipation swells in every space of  her body where muscles aren&apos;t fighting to escape, and she looks up to the top of the canopy, and surely enough, the treehouse is still there &mdash; but the rope ladder is snagged in a branch from some heavy gust of wind.",
            "&quot;Gods damn it!&quot; Bertram says.",
            "Katiya catches two seconds of breath, her body urged to act before she can think, climbing the tree with all the holds she memorized before they could smuggle the rope.",
            "&quot;Go, Katiya, go! Or else we&apos;ll have to go to the shrine,&quot; Bertram says.",
            "Her arms strain, and she hasn&apos;t the time to climb carefully: scratching her body everywhere as she fights nature more than the chase. She can hear whoops of laughter. And as she fights to withdraw the line of the ladder without falling, she gives up and jumps for it: leveraging all her weight on gravity  to bring the shoddy ladder down from the branch.",
            "And it gives.",
            "Her hands tension around both strands of the long loop of rope, wrapped once around a thick branch, and when her feet try to find the thin rungs of the ladder, she feels the wood snap beneath her, helpless as she falls to the ground and the wind is knocked out of her.",
            "But the boys are already climbing the ladder before she can find another breath that will enter her lungs. Bertram grabs her as she hears an inhuman voice click in the distance, claiming that &quot;climbing is cheating,&quot; but she finds she&apos;s already on the ladder below Raven and Bertram, leaving the last boy to climb alone as he wets his pants.",
            "She can see them now. Bertram drags Raven over the edge of the platform, then pulls Katiya as she scrambles through the splintered hole in the logs, and then Katiya reaches for Raph, only to notice that he&apos;s much further down the ladder than she thought.",
            "&quot;Please don&apos;t leave me,&quot; Raph sobs, snot covering his reddened face as he struggles to lift himself up the ladder.",
            "His left foot reaches the step that Katiya broke, and he stumbles, just as something dark and obsidian slices the air where his head was like a scythe harvests grain.",
            "And Katiya feels something weak and feeble that she hates inside her bring her further over the edge to reach as the Chymaeran Death Scouts cycle through the faces of human children they stole to terrify them further, and when she slips over the edge, Katiya and Raven grab her ankles, giving het just enough distance to grab Raph by the wrist.",
            "The Chymaerans give them space at the spectacle: maybe impressed a little, and maybe that slash was just a controlled act of terror.",
            "Nhytyx changes back to the form of the older boy as fast as Katiya can blink. &quot;You&apos;re a lot faster than the other children. But you get up there, and where will you go from there?&quot;",
            "Bertram and Raven pull with all their might. Katiya winces as her waist is stabbed with a thousand tiny splinters as she comes over the edge with Raph, the smell of excrement wafting through the air as the suspended twin cries. But when they pull him to the top, they realize his cries are of pain instead of panic, and when the dark crimson begins to soak the severed halves of the treehouse&apos;s planks, they find the reason Raph was light enough to pull.",
            "He crawls with a single foot as his skin turns pale: colder than the Chymaerans, and somewhere far below, the boys play catch with the part of him they left behind.",
            "&quot;I guess one part of you is going to get to dip its toes in the water first,&quot; Nhytyx clicks. &quot;But the rest is soon to follow!&quot;",
            "Raven holds Raph as he&apos;s on the verge of passing out, clutching the stump at the base of his twin brother&apos;s leg. The treehouse trembles as the scouts shake the trunk, casting amateurly-assembled planks driven with shallow nails, and as they hold to the only parts of the fort that hold their weight, Raph slips from Raven&apos;s grasp, sprawled across the uneven surface as his blood flows like sap between the gaps.",
            "Katiya tries to reach for him as she hugs the largest branch, but something resists inside her. The dry, severed logs are cracking beneath the weight, and when she finally wills her body to grab for the dying boy, he crunches through the platform, falling headlong as Katiya follows after.",
            "She falls for seconds, and she doesn&apos;t feel the rapture of swinging between trees. Below, the boy called Vylen extends his arms and catches her, barely able to slow her fall as something else catches Raph.",
            "Katiya lands to find Raph expressionless, yet impossibly upright as Vylen reluctantly claims that he &quot;found her,&quot; failing to convince the others that their game is over. But Katiya&apos;s head rests against something else, something uneven and organic. Something that sliced the flesh from her left brow to her cheek, and something that separates her skull from Raph&apos;s.",
            "The boy chokes with a guttural cry as he reaches for his head, finding that a branch has pierced directly through his jaw and out his mouth. Ralph stands fully upright, barely able to touch his toes as he tries to speak her name, but it&apos;s just the consonants.",
            "And Katiya screams.",
            "No longer does she remember the two other boys still hiding in the tree. She flees away from the treehouse, and away from home though she doesn&apos;t even realize it, and she runs and she runs, sobbing and weeping and screaming with the rapture of a fresh new emotion she&apos;s never experienced before, running and running until she breaks the trees, running through the clearing though she&apos;s lost every sense of direction and can&apos;t hear if they&apos;re still following her.",
            "She stumbles over something soft on the far side of the clearing, but doesn&apos;t have time to look. The pond is murky, dark, and motionless, as if the waves forgot how to move, but her nose is too stuffed from the crying to tell the contents of the brine.",
            "It&apos;s when the second clothed object arrests her feet that she falls headlong into the still water &mdash; finding all the other friends that Raph said they were pushing in."

         "Chapter 27 Scene 3": [
            "It&apos;s the cold snap that brings her back again, to find herself floating in a pit of flesh and brine. She must have been warmed by the panic of her rapid breathing in the last moment she remembers: feeling her meager volume of Essence sear her skin with the powers of fire she hadn&apos;t even learned yet.",
            "And in the odd moment of stillness, before she finds the space for the newfound habit of panic to arrest her again, she wonders if she&apos;s made it to the Reservoir of Souls when she looks up at the blanket of stars, like the planes of dark obsidian in the barren, dimensionless landscape where all their souls will convene to be born again.",
            "But she doesn&apos;t hear the voice of her grandfather calling her into the mist, or the voices of all the ones she&apos;s told will die long before and after her. She hears the voice of the seekers approaching as they hoist Raph&apos;s body in the air.",
            "She thinks something must have dislocated in her mind at how easily the panic arrives, but can&apos;t move when her body&apos;s so numbed by the languid brine of blood, rot, and water.",
            "Their voices click in their foreign tongue, passing through excited vibrations as their guises dissolve from the faces they stole. And as the cold brings her signature of life to a near halt, feathering the edge of death, she can only listen as they start to slide between languages.",
            "&quot;What happened to the two in the tree?&quot;",
            "&quot;They ran sometime after the boy and girl fell, and that bitch ran,&quot; another says.",
            "&quot;And where did she go?&quot;",
            "&quot;Probably ran home like the others, doesn&apos;t matter. Those kids and all their friends and family will all end up in holes like this one, whenever the reinforcements shoe and we get the others.&quot;",
            "One of them laughs, saying something in clicks. &quot;Speaking of, our work isn&apos;t done. And I think we have one last contribution to make here,&quot; they say.",
            "&quot;Dumb fucking kid,&quot; another laughs. &quot;Makes all this shit almost worth it. Swimming in a pond? Pushing each other in?&quot;",
            "&quot;Well, let&apos;s make his last moment count,&quot; Nhytyx says, and Katiya hears the rustling of fabric. They count in clicks as Raph is still too weak to make a sound &mdash; blotting out the starry sky like a small, dark comet before he slams into the solid, wet mass of bodies, shaking the entire mass as Katiya remains motionless.",
            "&quot;This pit is done. Let&apos;s dig half the next and save the rest for the morning,&quot; Nhytyx orders. &quot;The rest of you set up camp.&quot;",
            "And when their thin silhouettes no longer shadow the constellations, Katiya reaches over her head for the small boy, pulling with all her might, dragging to her chest the outcome of her cowardice.",
            "It was only last week that her father began to teach her how to heal, but she can feel the dying Essence in the spilled blood of the hapless civilians like electrons flowing freely between atoms.",
            "To pull the vital source is to feel flashes of those final moments, but it&apos;s nothing compared to the incessant sound of digging somewhere past the edge of the pit.",
            "At every slam of the shovel, she pulls Raph closer although she can barely feel him holding on: his tongue a dead instrument though she can feel the faintest rhythm of his heartbeat, his severed stump cauterized by Chymaeran frost so they could derive pleasure from delivering on the result of their game.",
            "And as she wraps her arms around Raph, tighter and tighter as she leeches every last spark of Essence from the dead that no longer use it, she feels the longing for something crystallized into an indebted purpose inside her as the slamming of shovels sounds off in an endless staccato, waiting forever, just for a chance to break for home.",
            "And the chance arrives after the shovels stop, and the distant clicks no longer echo across the landscape. Lantern light wanes, and when Katiya tries her muscles, she finds enough of the proffered dead Essence to lift herself from the mud and tar, feeling a debt to the victimized grow with every shambling step she takes across the wide, open field.",
            "She has no words for Bertram or Raven when she finds them at the rope, waiting there all night on the faintest hope of their return. Nor does she feel anything for months in the other end of the verbal lashing when they claim they fell playing heroes as they swung between the trees, hurting Raph so severely that they spent all night afraid to bring him home.",
            "She would never speak of that night again, because the only living witness without a tongue to tell would later die in the fire with his brother, when the Chymaerans chose to deliver on their promise to return.",
            "And every night since, Katiya waited at the window, feeling the chill in the air wrap around her like a wet blanket, listening to the sounds of the war front as she waited."

            "&quot;Maybe, maybe not,&quot; Nav says. &quot;I&apos;d suggest you just enjoy the free food and not think too much about it.&quot;",
            "He opens the door, unplugging his computer as fluorescent light exchanges for the blinding blue screen that now reads HDMI_1. I pass the chatty row without a glance, retreating to my desk to realize for the first time in three hours that I left my phone in the car.",
            "But I don&apos;t touch grass to go and get it. I complete two tasks. I check in the changes. I fill out the paperwork, and when the calendar reads 12:00 COMPANY LUNCHEON (MANDATORY), I head down alone before Kei and Reed can catch me.",
            "The food is good: they always spend well on these things, and it tracks my father&apos;s words. One lunch, he told me that &quot;office pukes&quot; will &quot;always work under the worst conditions, if management buys a box of shitty donuts for them once or twice a month.&quot;",
            "But I can&apos;t complain. It&apos;s not that bad here. Even though they still separate lunches for the elevated Aerospace team &mdash; then for the technicians and the rest of us &mdash; barbecued brisket served by managers takes my mind off the mortgage. And when I sit with my father, avoiding the ire of upper managers I lit up with those irrevocable words, he&apos;s always got some gearhead vet reminiscing about brothels in Okinawa, or using fruits to describe the new girls working at a strip club in downtown Denver.",
            "The laughter abates the anger and ennui for a while, and when my father claps me on the back as he laughs at every joke, I realize it&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve been touched intentionally in months. ",
            "I try not to think of the premonition I&apos;ve had of the meaning behind that cryptic email. The announcement comes after the raffle, and it&apos;s easier to depress that feeling of rapturous static when I&apos;ve confirmed that I&apos;m always rolling loaded dice. ",
            "The husky technician across from me opened his raffle prize to find an extra-small women&apos;s golf polo, and put it on to give us all a laugh. We all  got USB keychains, at least: labeled MONROECAREERS.COM, probably leftovers from last month&apos;s college job fair that&apos;d fill too much space in the supply room.",

And, more specifically, one of the young men in the battery division.&quot;",

            "And I feel my father withdraw his hand from me slowly. He reluctantly puts his hands together before muttering something he might tell me after a bad little league game, and when I look to the stage, I try to avoid Kei&apos;s eye contact when she glances back at me.",
            "&quot;This young man has only been here for a little under a year, but he gives us all something to aspire to.&quot; ",
            "I can feel the rage I thought I buried all those months ago leech through the surface like coffins in a flood. But I don&apos;t have the currency for another outburst, or even to leave, so I put my hands together just like my father who tries to hide his true feelings, clapping tensely without spring in either of my wrists.",
            "But remembering the fear of layoffs and the mortgage is the only thing that can humble me: the feeling of the long, looming shadow since that first meeting I almost overslept in spring &mdash; when they said they were coming, and to prepare ourselves.",

            "Reed only shuts up for a while when he&apos;s nervous: the only other sounds in the office are the 3D printer&apos;s whine, Wilbur&apos;s wake-apnea, and Michael&apos;s drastic fit of coughs every quarter hour, and when any of them are missing, I know that something&apos;s wrong.",
            "But he&apos;s not the kind to go it alone. And when I&apos;m sitting in my chair, watching myself do grunt work as my mind goes blank, he approaches me with the heavy box in his hands, choosing me as the elder subordinate to help him.",

            "&quot;It was a box when I started lifting it,&quot; he says. He shifts his weight to support the clattering mess of parts and washers and nuts and bolts inside, as Wilbur peeks his head over the partition. &quot;I heard you were born with a wrench in your hand,&quot; Reed continues, &quot;and I could use a second set of eyes on this prototype.&quot;",

            "And maybe they should, I think, and there&apos;s a part of me that so badly wants him to fail the way I hoped he would, the way I told him off after our walk all those months ago.",
            "But Reed is desperate, still hugging the pieces together as he begins to tremble from the weight. &quot;So can we grab a conference room?&quot;",

            "&quot;Kidding,&quot; I say.",
            "I reach with another set of hands, unloading the uppermost pieces from the box. The parts are so smooth: it looks and feels more like an industrial art piece than my soulless origami design.",

            "And yet you got the damn promotion, a part of me says, but it&apos;s something about his vulnerability that keeps me quiet, even if today&apos;s the second-worst day I&apos;ve had working here.",
            "We settle in the conference room after placing down rubberized mats from the machine shop, and ransacking my father&apos;s toolbox for all his lower-drawer, half-broken tools when he&apos;s having a smoke outside.",
            "He sits as I take the assembly in my hands, trying the fit &mdash; remembering the vicious wisdom of all the unsettled technicians that approached me in the two-and-a-half years before Reed got here, distilling it into something constructive although the anger is still there.",
            "They&apos;d lambaste the poor bastard over fits. One of the holes is designed for thread, though it&apos;s supposed to let it through. The square edge jams into a round because he forgot a chamfer, and sitting in the same seat I almost lost my job in, I tell him what to fix as he takes notes on a printout.",
            "&quot;So we need to rework this ourselves,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;But how?&quot; He asks.",
            "And so we go to the floor.",
            "I enter Dad&apos;s code for the supply box. I kit him out with gloves and sandpaper and taps and drill bits, and we head to the belt sander. And I let him work the steel surface like my father did when I first got here &mdash; humored by his panic at the silver sparks that launch from friction.",
            "And then to the mill. And then with the two-fluted end mill that we chuck in three pneumatic chirps, where I explain that this two-ton, belt-driven beast can only change gears when it&apos;s in motion, unlike the lathe that changes gears when it&apos;s halted.",
            "We set the pieces so they&apos;re square with the machine and clamp them down, and when the spindle reaches its speed of eight hundred rotations per minute, I find myself back in the zen of the machine shop all those years ago: shaving fifty thousandths at a time on pass after pass of quiet precision; casting slivers of scalding steel from the surface that dance in long, mesmerizing ribbons; hearing the coolant sizzle against the steel when I spray before Reed makes another hand-fed pass.",
            "And two hours later, the pieces fit &mdash; and Reed&apos;s printout is saturated with greasy fingerprints and red scribbles, our gloves pleasurably dirty with the grime of hands-on work, and for a second, I think I remember what I thought I was going to do here in the beginning.",

Even Kei is no longer here &mdash; and as I try to understand how such a miserable day could end so reasonably, I feel that feeling of hope escape for just a second before I can recapture it."

            "And in the silence of the dark garage, I&apos;m lit only by shop lights as I roll around on a scrapped shop stool I stole from the dumpster at work. As the soldering iron sizzles against the damp sponge, my mind replays the half-baked encouragement from my father, remembering how he told me that &quot;I have the essence&quot; of what I need.",

I tin the tip of the soldering iron, recirculating the sharp end with a growing bead of molten tin until it&apos;s almost too heavy to hold by surface tension.",
            "My hand slowly approaches the negative button end with a trembling bead, hoping it will work as flux to accept the molten metal, and the closer it gets,  the connection glows brighter with faint crimson light, no brighter than an LED.",
            "The sight distracts me from a healthy dose of hesitation. It was so easy to forget that there&apos;s an entire other world beyond the door with different rules, and when the glowing bead finally adheres to the powdered lead, drowning the contours of the cheap metal tab with scalding metal at liquefying heat, I&apos;m unprepared for the realization of what comes next.",

And when my finger flicks the slide switch, I feel a massive jolt of energy kick the flashlight backwards as it slips through my hand, casting the entire garage in a bright, crimson glow.",
            "The nurled handle of the flashlight embeds itself in the pegboard, displacing all the tools in a raucous clatter as a wall-mounted bucket of tiny screws explodes like shotgun pellets, but the crash is silent compared to the otherworldly, phantasmic screech that rings in my ears.",
            "My eyes and ears need seconds to recover &mdash; my heart even longer &mdash; as my eyes fall to the triplet spread of holes in the far wall, siphoning streetlight in three beams that take shape from floating dust.",

I went out there with only the emergency lights on, missing security and custodial staff that might have asked me to turn around, with the battery in one hand and the pouch of Essence in my pocket. I only used his credentials because &quot;open to anyone&quot; stops applying after hours. I&apos;ve heard the techs let each other in all the time: even engineers, and the sign reads PROTOTYPE SHOP OPEN 24/7: TEST LABS RESTRICTED, leading me to ignore the intimidating packet of operating procedures pinned to the bulletin board outside the door.",

It was too dark to read in the dim light from all the other screens, and I convinced myself that it was just there to secure the wires, not that it was locked and tagged out. ",

I turned up the current through the wire until I could see my breath fog the power supply&apos;s seven-segment readout. A stack light flashed red around the time I almost thought I&apos;d need gloves to withdraw the pouch of Essence. Then the E-stop relay tripped. The cell status flipped to HOLD, and the HVAC system sputtered to life after it logged an anomalous temperature, recirculating heat into the cold air.",

And if any scientist witnessed the sheer impossibility of a battery discharging power while charging &mdash; like a candle creating wax as it burns upwards &mdash; it would efface every understanding of science. And if it leaked further, I&apos;m certain there wouldn&apos;t be a power in the world that would hesitate to use all their strength to secure the source.",

The moment made me feel powerful, like I could accomplish something the powers above would have to accept. But I should have known why Prometheus was sentenced to rot for all eternity.",

            "The static returns to my hands when I sit idle on my sofa. Listening to the sounds on the electric music box named JACKSON&apos;S IPOD only worked for so long until it ran out of power, unchargeable by Essence from my hands&mdash;and though the hear-buds&apos; end fits into the phone Cody got me, I don&apos;t have many sounds I&apos;ve saved to play.",
            "But he made me a playing list on an application for my workouts &mdash; and saved it to the box, so I could use it when the &quot;cloud&quot; couldn&apos;t give the box the music.",
            "I&apos;m efficient enough at scrolling that he told me I was &quot;better than his mom,&quot; and when I scroll through the list, I find my favorite song from a band that must have played a lot in public if they named their group after a common space.",
            "The screen reads LINKIN PARK&mdash;BREAKING THE HABIT, as it scrolls the letters across the screen. I wonder again what Cody meant when he called it &quot;new metal.&quot; I think of the sound of my stepfather&apos;s hammer in the blacksmith shop: whether hot or cold, shouldn&apos;t it make the same sound either way?",
            "But the motifs speak to me. The speed sounds like my panic. The rhythm feels like my heartbeat. It describes my anxiety better than any combination of words, and when I let it speak for that bottomless sense of panic, it makes me feel a little lighter, maybe even understood.",
            "So I take it with me, clutching my cure with the buds in my ears. I tightly lock the door and try to lose my breath again, though my body still aches: so sore and dehydrated, but there&apos;s a resentment that&apos;s stronger than the burning in my breath. So I start running, circling the lake as night approaches, fighting the feeling of dizziness that threatens to take me over.",
            "Internal weakness is an enemy I can actually fight, so I use that churning feeling of self-hatred as something combustible. The fear for my family overrides the feeling of strain in my muscles, and though I&apos;m short of breath, I&apos;m perfectly distracted by the chill that signals winter, breathing across the surface of the lake in a phantasmic fog.",
            "And the words of Aryn cross my mind. I remember Jullian&apos;s look of disdain, and I think of Cody and how much I miss him, though I&apos;d never tell him that, and by the time I&apos;m coming back after a quarter-pass around the lake, the feeling of lightness overtakes me.",
            "I struggle to catch myself before I collapse into a planter of withering mountain flowers, crunching the dormant stems beneath my weight. The darkness is immediate when it overtakes me, and when I lose control of my muscles, time flashes past in a dreamless sleep until I wake to a vibration beneath my leg.",

            "I ate lunch in the empty set of cubicles that look out to the shop floor, pushing away the furloughed purchasers&apos; junk they refused to take home. I watched my father toil away on the floor, sorting through the bins of KANBAN bolts and screws to make progress on his projects, none wiser since the technicians don&apos;t have an email.",
            "But they usually print out the announcements and tape them to the break room door, and every hour I got up to scan the floor for Human Resources, or Compliance, or a new posting on the door my father will surely bring up, I don&apos;t find anything.",
            "Maybe they expect the technicians. Maybe that&apos;s why they haven&apos;t bothered coming up here. Or, shit, maybe they&apos;re playing it &quot;fast and quiet,&quot;waiting for a response &mdash; or maybe it&apos;s like those cop shows where they give the guy eight hours to wait and stew before they interview him? If that&apos;s the case, then&mdash;",

            "&quot;I dunno. I just looked at the calendar the other day, and it all came back to me.&quot;",
            "&quot;Listen, Cody. You&apos;re a good engineer. You&apos;re doing just fine, okay? I guess you youngsters need to hear that more often. Ever since my generation realized participation trophies weren&apos;t replacements for an &apos;attaboy,&apos; you fellas haven&apos;t gotten anything.&quot;He leans closer, and I can see a sincerity in his eyes that only makes me feel worse. &quot;I mean, you haven&apos;t done anything wrong, right? You work hard. And that origami design you came up with proves&mdash;&quot;",

            "&quot;No, not that: just some techs doing what they shouldn&apos;t. I&apos;m talking about the one I just sent you, about the battery project&mdash;&quot; He glances down at the redlines I&apos;ve blasted through. &quot;Hai ram, am I not keeping you busy enough?&quot;",
            "&quot;Had a pre-workout drink before I went to the gym with Reed this morning, and my face still itches,&quot; I say. &quot;Big mistake.&quot;",
            "&quot;Well, at least my team is getting along,&quot; Nav says. &quot;Good work. Tell you what: how about I let you head out thirty minutes early?&quot;",
            "&quot;Really?&quot; I ask.",
            "&quot;Sure,&quot; Nav says, clapping me on the shoulder. &quot;And you did the paperwork for these changes too, right?&quot;",
            "&quot;In the system,&quot; I say, collecting my things as I toss my bag over my shoulder. I hear a door open on the far end of the office from the floor, and as I grab my mouse and lunchbox, I notice it hangs open to let several people through.",
            "I turn the corner of the cubes after thanking Nav. Several suits are walking towards me, but I walk in the opposite direction, banking on the knowledge that they&apos;ve never seen my face before, refusing to turn around as I wave to Reed and Kei and Michael, and I proceed out to the concrete steps where I take my first real breath of the day.",
            "I rush down to my car and turn the key as soon as my leg hits the brake. And I laugh: not because I&apos;ve won, but because I realize I&apos;m feeling something other than depressed for the first time in ages, and the capacity to feel almost scares me.",
            "But there&apos;s only so long before the spike of adrenaline retreats into the same sea of apathy as I drive home. Ever since the layoff warning at the start of the year, I&apos;ve constantly wondered how many more times I&apos;d be driving the switchbacks along the hillside, and for the first time, I wonder if I can count them on my hands.",
            "I get home around the time I&apos;d typically leave work, and by the time I pull into the garage, I realize the fear has completely left me. When I spend so long looking up from the bottom of the darkest pit, I don&apos;t think fear ever really stays: in the end, I guess I just figure it works out somehow &mdash; or if it doesn&apos;t &mdash; I just don&apos;t think I really care.",
            "The last time I felt that continuity was when Katiya was always over, like shoveling coal into the cold engine of my soul, and before that it was just the busyness of school and the incessant badgering to go out my my business major roommates.",
            "Whatever I have isn&apos;t renewable like everyone else. Just like Kei: the reason why we can&apos;t fit, if neither one of us can make the energy.",
            "I sit on the couch in the dark, and I try to cry, just to see if I can do it, because I think it&apos;s what anyone else would do, and my mom says it&apos;s healthy, but I can only muster a tear before it ends in a yawn, and my body thinks I&apos;m just trying to wet my eyes for my contacts.",
            "And so I just sit there without turning the TV on, back to the same habit of just doing nothing until I get too bored and go to sleep.",
            "That is, until I hear the crash next door, and the desperate crash of footfalls as someone or something proceeds to tear through every room of the house next door.",
            "I open my phone and scroll through Messages to select her name. The send button is blur, meaning she has it on, and it bewilders me. ",

            "Also heard something loud next door u alright?",

            "I withdraw my hand, hearing the exasperated groan on the other side, as if someone&apos;s in a rush.",
            "&quot;Katiya?&quot; I try. And then the door flings open, and I&apos;m greeted by someone else: someone who&apos;s trying to get through to my side.",
            "But I block her. ",
            "It&apos;s a human girl with cat ears, and they&apos;re real, but before I can settle the debate over whether she has human ears, too, she pleads for me to hide her.",

            "&quot;Well, we can&apos;t hide in there,&quot; I say, closing the door behind me as the metal cools enough to stick. &quot;What&apos;s going on?&quot;",
            "&quot;I made my break. I used to live here: it&apos;s the only place I could think of, but they know where I am and they&apos;re after me because I can&apos;t ever leave and I&mdash;&quot;",
            "&quot;Calm down,&quot; I say. I find myself patting her head reflexively before I rip my hand away, rushing to Katiya&apos;s front door as I hold the lacrosse stick end-up. She must be close enough to get my WiFi after I installed the extender right outside my door, because her messages are still blue.",
            "The front door buffets open, and at first I think it&apos;s Katiya about to close the loop on our relationship. But it&apos;s someone else: two strangers with the bodies of cats, and they&apos;re holding daggers as the catgirl shrinks behind me.",

I rush down the line of row houses on a street lit by lamplight, filled with the anticipation of catching a first glance at the damage to my home. But there isn&apos;t enough of a spectacle to draw neighbors.",
            "With the element of surprise on my side, I turn into my next-door neighbor&apos;s front terrace and jump the short wrought-iron fence so I&apos;m out of sight of my open door. There&apos;s no shattered glass, and there isn&apos;t any damage to the door frame from kicking in the entry door. Something dark and metallic protrudes from the lock, and I realize it&apos;s a key: not my key, because when I check my pockets, it&apos;s still there, and as I approach closer, I hear two panicked voices pleading with the intruders.",

            "I let all the fury the run failed to quell rush my circuits with Essence, and by the time my fist reaches the first Ahkvasan&apos;s face, an eruption of fire blasts them against the back window, shattering the glass as their body crunches into the frame of the lower window. As I watch Cody look on through swollen eyes, my rage builds so fast that I feel the heat coalesce around my entire body, and when the second one slows me down enough to slash my arm with the dagger, I feel nothing, as my body&apos;s already committed to driving my other fist square in the assailant&apos;s chest.",
            "It smells like burning fur, and maybe that ignites something forgotten in Aryn&apos;s forsaken sister. As the other tries to wedge their body out of the shattered glass frame, embedded with shards that redden their coat, Rayna blasts a fireball that knocks them out the window, protecting the space behind Cody as I step in front of him.",

            "I struggle to shake the thought of all my friends in the capital that became housewives. &quot;I&apos;m sorry my hands are so calloused,&quot; I tell him. &quot;I grew up swinging from trees and chopping wood. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a soft part of me left.&quot;",

Maybe it&apos;s my empathy for that paralyzing, sticky feeling of fear that I know better than anyone. Or maybe it was in the feelings we both had of abandonment, as we continue to sully everything in our lives with only the best intentions.",
            "Or maybe it was the excuse to let Rayna sleep in my bed in Gaffesend that allowed us to bend the rule.",
            "Either way, fate finds me in Cody&apos;s world, upstairs for the first time. I&apos;m on the side of the bed that faces the door, separated by two thin sheets, resting on top of the covers since I run dangerously hot. I watch Cody curled up with his head buried in a pillow: he doesn&apos;t twitch in his sleep like so many of us, but with me sleeping next to him, he breathes so easily, knowing nothing of the violence of war or its outcomes.",
            "And sleep comes easily when I listen to the pattern of his breath: his exhale warm on my bare skin as an unfamiliar breeze flows through the window, and by the time I notice how stale the air is, I&apos;ve already retreated within my mind to a place I can never leave.",
            "Sometimes it&apos;s the scalding log that presses on my chest: other times, it&apos;s the body of Raph, and I&apos;m trapped inside that pit again, struggling to survive as I wait for lifetimes in absolute silence. In one dream I&apos;m on the verge of freezing as my body tries to heat itself with every scrap of dead Essence I can pilfer from the bodies, and in the other, I feel the heat rise until I think the flesh will melt from my bones.",
            "But after so many nights alone, even my subconscious mind has stopped providing me with a savior, knowing the bed is always empty when I wake.",
            "So the pit grows deeper, stretching downward until I can no longer see the stars, and even more victims flood the pit as the Chymaerans toss them in. Or the wooden cabin walls grow in seconds, as if grown through Verdalan magic, lifting the doors and window frames higher and higher until they&apos;re unreachable, leaving me inside the smoke-filled windowless chamber next to the charred body of my father.",
            "It&apos;s both dreams at the same time now, but there&apos;s always something pinning me to the floor as the heat rises. I look to the left as my father takes his last, scalding breaths before he turns to ash, and my lungs are burning, thrashing beneath the beam as I find I don&apos;t have a mouth to scream, and when the roof finally csves in &mdash; or the stars fall from the sky to rebury the pit of remains, I launch awake with another scream, too unconscious to question whether Jullian will be laying there.",
            "But for the first time, my hands find something else, and instead of grasping air as the dream fades from my mind, I feel Cody&apos;s touch as he tucks my head to his chest though the sheets still separate us, telling me that everything is going to be alright.",
            "And I cry, though I&apos;m surprised I still have access to this feeling. Even without Essence, I can feel the warmth of his body, passing strings of reassuring words through trembling syllables that I&apos;ve only dreamed to hear after so many months alone.",
            "And I want so badly to tilt my head up, to meet his lips to reciprocate this blessed feeling, to provide him the comfort that he also longs for, but I hesitate on that feeling of how much pain that progress would inevitably cause us.",
            "Never before have I felt this safe.",
            "So I just rest there, recirculating the warmth of my breath in the tight space between his chest as he instructs me to slow my breathing, even though his own still carries a faint whimper. The night is still dark, and moments later, I delve back into a dream that I&apos;ve never had before.",
            "I find myself outside the windowless cabin, sitting on the porch, in one of the smoothly-sanded rocking chairs my father made. My fingers feel the persistence of his handiwork against the natural grain, and beside me sit my father, and my stepfather, and my mother and my siblings, and Cody, and all my friends old and new, and even family that has yet to be born, and all we&apos;re doing is just sitting there, watching the daylight climb above the sawtooth treeline of Purgatory Mountains as another long night gives way to dawn.",
            "My father takes my hand though I can&apos;t see or remember his face, but in the moment, I feel something unspoken between us &mdash; something I never tried listening for when I was so busy watching from the window.",
            "And when I wake, I find Cody still sleeping beside me with his hand in mine, and our bodies are still separated by two sheets. Maybe the only way I can repay him is to give him something he won&apos;t remember.",
            " I gently plant a kiss on his forehead, muttering the same words my father gave to me in the dream."

            "&quot;Then it&apos;s no wonder you&apos;re so rusty,&quot; I say, launching another jab at her as she leaps backward. It&apos;s hard not to use Essence or acrobatics: Cody sternly told us not to go all out, saying we&apos;d either get kicked out or end up working here.",

She said she&apos;d lose so I could impress him, even though I never asked in the first place. But Rayna doesn&apos;t make it easy. I can tell she&apos;s stretching time in the narrow moments when she strikes, so fast that the rattan sword bends before it even hits.",

We rose up the bracket so fast that the Ring Captain asked us to stretch it out to fill the thirty minute time slot, taking out adults in silver-painted football pads in a single strike, jabbing them in the chest so hard that the end of the sword blossomed like a parasol before snapping back to its original shape.",

I feel I&apos;ve gotten more praise than I ever will in all my life, even if it&apos;s all pretend, and as he shuffles nervously across the long stretch of dirt, I head directly for him, riding high on the mote of undeniable attraction I find in his eyes.",

            "I pull him down a couple inches as his face flushes further, and the audience cheers when the two of us make contact. It&apos;s just a brief peck, but I find my gauntlets grasping the back of his head as my other hand tenses in his shirt, feeling an arm wrap around my waist as we take the beat we&apos;ve forestalled forever.",

            "His face falls after the others leave and it&apos;s just Rayna and I. He says he&apos;s exhausted, though he has enough energy to find a drinking glass to vase the rose, and after the three of us watch movies for a couple hours, leaving Rayna with a blanket to sleep on the couch, we retire up to Cody&apos;s room to sleep separately together again, but he&apos;s snared in something.

But sometimes I think I hear short mutterings &mdash; whether it&apos;s a curse or cry or a a whimper between breaths &mdash; and I&apos;m sure I can feel him tremble in bed the same way he did the night of the break-in.",
            "After almost an hour, I finally find the courage to turn around and offer my warmth to him. My arm extends around his waist: and I try to pull him in: a position of protection my ex would never let me do, and whether Cody&apos;s sleeping or faking it, I finally feel his breaths rise and fall slower with less trembling in his throat.",
            "When I find sleep, I&apos;m outside the cabin again, sitting there as I watch the sunrise, surrounded by all the ones I know and cherish. I&apos;m telling my father of my day in Cody&apos;s mockery of my world: the tournament of challengers with fearsome names and lackluster technique. The stands of craftspeople my father would love to meet, with all their trinkets, odds, and ends, and I think another peaceful dream will find me for the second time &mdash; until the sun rises red with blood and I can smell the smoke in the air, itching my throat and burning my eyes until a loud screech shakes the entire town.",

            "The clock reads 6:40: Cody&apos;s gone because he said he had to go to work, and he must have just left. I was planning to do an evening quest, intending to sleep in for the first time in ages.",
            "But the screech is deafening as I throw open all the windows, bolting downstairs in my nightgown in case Cody left something on after making breakfast. My hands rise with Essence on-command to siphon the energy from any open flame, and though the smoke is worse downstairs, I don&apos;t sense anything emitting enough heat to warrant such a sightless plume.",

            "The shattered window I covered with fabric did so little to prevent the overwhelming flood of ashen smoke from the outside air. My floor is covered with specks of black: some still glowing with heat from whatever unfolds beyond my walls, and with my connecting door left carelessly ajar, the specks have scattered onto Cody&apos;s polished floors.",

            "&quot;Quest sheets,&quot; I say. My eyes water, but I can so easily recognize the handwriting. It&apos;s the same sheet he tried to give me in the hospital, when I was too afraid to leave the town. And when I rush out the door, covering my mouth as I rue the fact that it looks like I slept in, I try to catch up with him, the world so obscured by the ash and smoke I can only make out the silhouettes of the townspeople as they rush past me."

But it was like waking from a restless night with a severe cold, because once my conscious mind became aware of the great discomfort, there wasn&apos;t a chance I would be able to get myself back to sleep.",

Maybe if I showered and made it in when the early risers do &mdash; like Reed and Kei &mdash; I could leave earlier and still finish eight hours of work, but then any odd action might be an admission of guilt, and surely they would know what I was trying to do. So I couldn&apos;t go in late, either: I would have to go in at exactly the same time, acting none the wiser, as if a wide-sweeping investigation wouldn&apos;t be stalking me as soon as my badge number registered on the door&apos;s security console.",

Last night I was tempted to re-read the email for the tenth time, but I didn&apos;t want the bright screen to wake the girl sleeping next to me, and I knew it wasn&apos;t good for me either, so I just let the thoughts run their course like a fever until my mind was too exhausted to trouble me any further. By the time Katiya noticed enough to wrap her arm around me, suffusing me with the warmth of her otherworldly touch, I found just enough comfort to pass out.",

I&apos;m more frightened of how unafraid I am, pulled back to the depths of my apathetic exhaustion that covers me like a wet blanket although the sheets that wrap around me are dry. Maybe last night I could find a couple tears before my body misconstrued my attempt at exorcising that long-forgotten emotion for a yawn, but as the clock finally reaches the time I&apos;m set to rise, I only have enough energy to shower and dress myself. I wear Navidson-Monroe blue with the logo proudly emblazoned on the breast pocket, and I tuck it into jeans with a belt. My stomach is too empty to fill, so I bring nothing to work with me, fully expecting to be out by midday at a bar somewhere.",

Dodging between hallways feels like playing paintball in close quarters until I make it to my desk at the exact average time I get in every day, but the discomfort catches up with me. Maybe it&apos;s the breakfast I skipped, or the sleeplessness, or the call of the void that left me without an appetite, dragging me to the bathroom to slam the stall door shut to get on my knees and lose the nothing I ate before this, dry-retching as someone else quickly washes their hands and vacates the bathroom.",

The private sector dodges a lot of the slow, bureaucratic cycle of government, and I was sure they&apos;d already drawn the documents for my termination, but they left themselves another option just in case.

As of Monday, November 30, I made the lateral transition to assume the role of an entry-level mechanical technician, survived by a rusty red box of tools that I still don&apos;t know the half of, left to look up through the office window at a realm that is no longer privileged to me.",

He was at least the one that tried to stand up for me: as they chose my fate in a few minutes, he protested that I was a new entry-level engineer being dropped like a hot rock into a competitive market. So after they decided to let me stay under austere conditions, Nav explained that it was &quot;my chance to walk away quietly, with a shred of dignity and a believable lie.&quot;",

It&apos;s an energy that races my circuits with the same signature of power but a different medium &mdash; like how human Essence can give rise to powers of both life and fire &mdash; and if Cody&apos;s faith in me lifted a sense of life, it&apos;s a fear for Bertram that blazes a fire.",
            "The feeling carries me through the streets in a rush: one hand holding Bertram&apos;s quest sheet as a tightly-rolled scroll while the other holds a damp dishrag from Cody&apos;s world to my mouth. Some civilians watch from the windows of their homes: others head south, shouldering enough provisions to wait it all out.",
            "It was supposed to be winter when the Chymaera planned their attack, and if the Essence event to the north is their handiwork, it&apos;s because Blackwater runs in a cold, eternal winter.

All I know now is that Gaffesend is the last northern base holding the Purgatory Line &mdash; leaving Hillfar as no more than a burnt offering.",

            "I could rue my decision to sleep in Cody&apos;s world. I was told to take the morning off until the carpenters fixed my window, so I could scout into the evening, but now my absence is suspicious. The anger fuels me as I weave between civilians that march to the base for a sense of sanctuary, and when I break the threshold of the large, metal gates, I&apos;m surprised when I find all of the junior guards sitting around.",

There&apos;s two other junior cadets that inspect an empty stall &mdash; Flint&apos;s stall &mdash; noticing all the excesses he left behind. Aryn lifts a broken necklace, the string tethered through a pendant he fashioned from the debris of that fateful night.

Aldrin and his royal knights dive to the side as Soot noses between them, catching a glance of my fluttering braid as I coax Soot to full speed, unable to hear whether the shouts behind me are admonitions of my commanding officer or the voices of friends I might be hearing for the last time."

I fight the blinding smoke for enough vision to lead Soot as my eyes water, breathing shallowly in the space behind Soot&apos;s neck that he drafts with air. While Soot toils with speed, my mind races over coming up with a plan: something, anything to turn Bertram around and get him back home safe. ",

For the longest time, I hear nothing but the wind whistling in my ears as we race through a long straightaway. It&apos;s only when we pass the limit of my runs, where the trail bends right to curve around a small cove, that the shouting finally has its chance to carry across the water.",
            "It&apos;s two voices, high and low, and when I listen closer, I can hear the rhythm of hoofbeats. I can&apos;t let them turn me around when Bertram is all alone: if I&apos;m paying for my disobedience, I better spend every last Kine of it.",
            "The trail tapers off at a rugged delta of shallow streams, feeding south to Northaven from the high mountains, and though I coax Soot to go faster, he&apos;s confused at where to go. As Soot and I ford the first stream, kicking up splashes of river water as I goad him to run, I hear my pursuers gaining on me, and I refuse to look back until they dare to drag me home.",
            "I keep riding, riding carelessly, carelessly enough to distance myself, with only the thought of Bertram&apos;s fate twisting in my mind. The image is loud enough to drown out their cries, and by the time I&apos;ve crossed the shallows, they&apos;ve disappeared into the haze.",
            "I ride through the forest, beginning to recognize the landmarks from my furthest treks from Hillfar as a child. Soot gallops on without awareness of any danger, and it means my hesitation can&apos;t stop me anymore.",
            "That is, until I spot a felled tree on the side of the road tethered with a brown horse. The village is getting closer. These are the outskirts of where I used to walk, just beyond my father&apos;s sight where his shrill whistle could bring me home. Maybe the nostalgia would bring an air of peace if it weren&apos;t for the glow of amethyst in the bark, and the sound of commotion somewhere several hundred yards away.",

I haven&apos;t the time to react before they respond to their own mistake in stealth, and then they tackle me to the ground, covering my mouth as I expect a cold, obsidian limb to skewer my chest.",
            "I&apos;m about to scream before I realize the hand is warm. There&apos;s no dagger to my throat: the only sensation I feel is the deceleration of time as my adversary anticipates what I&apos;ll do next, and when I turn around, Aryn&apos;s eyes narrow with fear, as Jullian stands behind her.",

I pray the civilians had time to escape when all the human corpses wear the leather armor of the Hillfar Militia, interspersed with the dark-shelled bodies of crumpled Chymaerans at an even balance. The longing for his voice pulls me closer to conflict though all I want is just to call his name.",

They shout for someone else that isn&apos;t with them, and when they turn to find the flaxen-haired girl with a scar that missed her eye and severed her brow, they recognize me in an instant.",

The children must have made it out in time: the only forgotten shapes are just toys and dolls abandoned in the middle of play, and when I rush for the shattered back window, hearing the clicks of a couple Chymaerans advancing in a pincer, I finally catch a glimpse of Bertram holding his niece in a small shed.",
            "I have the element of surprise: I&apos;ve been excluded from the Chymaerans&apos; calculus, and with the loaded weapon in my hands, I&apos;m prepared to either save him or die in a complete circle of life. My hands don&apos;t tremble when I steady the rifle on the windowsill, and when Bertram sees me in the window, I find a sense of hope reinvigorates him from helplessness.",

You take the one that&apos;s furthest to the left, and I&apos;ll take the other. Jullian shoots whatever&apos;s still standing.&quot;",

The Essence in my hands ignites the rifle that was only designed for wielders of fire. I pulse Essence to blast the one on the right two times and drop them: Aryn puts a round right between the left one&apos;s triangle of glowing eyes, and Jullian pops a round into each of them.",

And at the bottom of the union pecking order, with about a week of seniority, all I build is just the sub-assemblies &mdash; or subs &mdash; with about three different screws I have to fasten in the holes.",

One of the holes on the drawings is deep enough, but Reed specified the wrong depth for the thread: probably just went with the default setting in the software instead of checking the parameters. It&apos;s something I could fix in minutes if I still had access, but since my new masters crack the whip &mdash; asking every hour when I&apos;ll &quot;get it done&quot; &mdash; I have no choice but to go exactly where I don&apos;t belong.",

I skulk down the aisle of cubes as a stranger in a familiar land, fighting the urge to hide in an empty row at any provocation, but this is the fate I accepted. Nav said it was my chance to &quot;back away quietly,&quot; but I never took it: now I&apos;m a remorseful ghost, longing for resolution for a time that long passed. ",

He taught himself guitar in a week, and piano in another two. He brute-forced high school and earned his place as valedictorian: got first place in the race, but traded paint with just about damn near every guardrail to get there, and didn&apos;t have it in him to change in college. And he gave up.&quot;",

It&apos;s too cold for anybody else, and as my breath leaves my body in clouds, I leave my car behind on the side of the road and try to return to the lookout rock where everything once made sense.",
            "It&apos;s freezing: my car read 30 degrees Fahrenheit, but I&apos;ve always been warm-blooded, and as I descend through the shrubbery after climbing the fence and passing the graffitied sign that reads DANIELS PARK, my body begins to shiver, but I think it&apos;s the only way I&apos;ll rest without pain.",
            "The rock is the same way I left it. Miguel and Jackson and I used to hang our legs over the side of the highest point in the park for the sense of adrenaline, staying out late on summer nights until the stars came out, or a cop&apos;s flashlight filtered through the bushes. But I lay with my back against the freezing rock, looking out across the blanket of stars that are indistinguishable from the lights of distant streetlamps on the front range, as a river of white-and-red lights at the foot of the mountains weave in opposite directions.",
            "I begin to shiver. I don&apos;t have Essence like Katiya, and in this game of chicken I wonder how long I&apos;ll stay here. I imagine the headlines if I took a single half-roll, or if the cold numbed me enough to peacefully fall asleep. Reed hasn&apos;t known me long enough to care, but Kei would be hurt for a while. Katiya would move on in her own world. My parents would be devastated to lose their last son, and I realize that I think that&apos;s the I oh thing keeping me on the edge here, shivering, yet still refusing to cede to all the things behind me, away from the ledge.",
            "I wonder how much it would take to set me off &mdash; Wallace said it was like jumping from a burning building, and no one understands what could ever bring you to do it &mdash; because they don&apos;t understand how preferable jumping is to the fire and smoke.",
            "My muscles tense. I let my mind race with those manufactured premonitions, then how I&apos;m being pathetic and dramatic, then back to the abandonment I feel as I let my muscles tense as if to roll.",
            "I feel a vibration in my pocket, then nearly drop my phone three stories in my frozen hands that struggle to hinge. My fingers barely register on the touchscreen, but I bring it to my face, deciding to read one last birthday message.",
            "Alan Dunsmore // 22:53",
            "HAPPY BITRHDAY I LOVE YOU SON ",
            "I&apos;ve already rolled back to keep from dropping my phone off the ledge, and with my cold hands struggling to read the rest of my parents&apos; four messages, I realize I&apos;m accidentally calling them.",
            "They pick up in an instant: it&apos;s my mom.",
            "&quot;Happy birthday, birthday boy,&quot; she says. &quot;Do you ever check your phone?&quot;",

            "&quot;J-just downtown. Went t-to a bar with some friends,&quot; I say, wiping the wetness from my face. &quot;S-so late I f-forgot a jacket.&quot;",

            "I pause, realizing I&apos;d pass the same way my brother did, with fewer bullet holes. &quot;Huh.&quot;",
            "&quot;I wish we could have seen you. I know things are rough right now, but it means a lot you took the time to call. We love you taller than the mountains and brighter than the sun,&quot; Mom says, as I watch the light fade from the sawtooth edge of the mountain peaks.",
            "&quot;And I love you too,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;Go home and get warm! You can&apos;t catch a cold when you&apos;re on unpaid time off,&quot; she says. &quot;The union can&apos;t save you from being sick.&quot;",
            "I sniffle. &quot;Will do.&quot; ",
            "And then I hang up.",
            "It&apos;s not enough to get me up yet, but I sit with my back against a protrusion in the rock. My Lock Screen is still of that day at the Renaissance Faire: the picture Kei snuck of Katiya kissing my cheek.",
            "I look up in the sky on a cloudless night, finding cold, dead stars whose light took more than a thousand lifetimes to reach my eyes, and revel just enough to bask a little in the smallness of my perspective, finding kinship with my impermanence.",
            "A little later, I grab the first stone I find on the ground and deposit it in my pocket, heading back to the car as the cold chills every joint in my body, turning the ignition as I warm my hands over the heaters: not feeling better, but just deciding to ride it out.",
            "I&apos;ll live the next five minutes. And in another five, I&apos;ll decide to go another ten. And after a while, maybe I&apos;ll find it in me to let myself feel just enough hope &mdash; enough to start thinking about the last shot I have before the culling of winter layoffs."

            "But the machinations of this ceremony don&apos;t do me any service. This is my last chance to see the town I was born into, and the safest it will ever be, so I decide to slip from the thin line of observers on the path to his house. I already saw him, but I never made peace with the land we came from.",
            "The stone wall is the same as it was twenty years ago. The trees got taller, and so have I, when I realize all I have to do is jump from a rock to get to that first branch that Bertram and the twins once crawled across. I shoulder myself over the stone wall before anyone can notice, heading east on memory of the terrain when all the foliage has died and regrown several times over.",
            "I feel the same eyes on me this time, as if those Chymaerans stood still for decades like the trees &mdash; just waiting to reclaim what they failed to catch, but if it&apos;s the last day I have to live, I want this game to end.",
            "The field is smaller than I remember, but even with the approach of frost, the landscape is verdant and beautiful, without a line of dirt unearthed by Chymaeran hands. Where once the victims of war were left in shallow graves, their dead Essence recycled into saplings and shrubs and long grasses. So much wildlife now inhabits the expanse beyond Hillfar, because nature doesn&apos;t care for the petty squabbles of the overly-conscious. I sit with my back to a massive tree where the pit once was, feeling the pleasure of shade as a light dusting of snow graces the air. A tremendous resonance of energy feathers my circuits as I think I&apos;ll fall asleep, with no intention to wake again.",
            "The funeral is surely over by now. There&apos;s no other event left to wait for, to separate me from the tribunal, and as I begin to drift off to sleep, I&apos;m interrupted by the kick of a stranger against my boot.",
            "&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; A man asks. He looks slightly younger than me, with piercing, dark eyes and jet-black hair that make me think he&apos;s weathered several lifetimes. &quot;Are you one of us survivors that has nowhere to go?&quot;",
            "And then a beautiful woman with silken, dark hair steps from behind him, a couple inches taller. The crimson rings in her eyes match the vibrant ends of her hair.",
            "Their Essence is so strong that it sends shivers down my circuits: the first time I&apos;ve ever felt it at a distance.",
            "&quot;I was just trying to get away,&quot; I say. &quot;If I wasn&apos;t so indebted to my past, I might head south with the both of you.&quot;",
            "&quot;So you&apos;re not?&quot; The woman asks. &quot;Are you from here? We didn&apos;t know there was a town.&quot;",
            "&quot;This is Gaffesend,&quot; I say. &quot;And you&apos;re headed for Northaven?&quot;",
            "&quot;Whatever is left of it,&quot; the man says, scratching his thick beard.",
            "&quot;What&apos;s left is a whole city. The royalty were driven out a hundred years ago, but now it&apos;s less, uh . . . xenophobic.&quot;",
            "&quot;Just like the books, Titus,&quot; the woman says. ",
            "Titus opens his rucksack, withdrawing an old book printed with red ink, scanning an ancient map on a looseleaf page with circles scrawled all across it. &quot;We&apos;re certainly far past Everett&apos;s bounds.&quot;",

            "&quot;The daughter of Khiras.&quot;",

            "&quot;Too far to measure,&quot; I say. &quot;My name is Katiya, and I am . . . or was, a Royal Guard.&quot;",
            "&quot;And my name is Sylvia,&quot; she says. &quot;Just Sylvia. And we&apos;re refugees from the North. We used to be Royal Guards just like you!&quot;",

            "I laugh, but they look serious. Then they laugh, and I laugh with them. ",

            "&quot;You wouldn&apos;t know him,&quot; I say.  ",

            "&quot;If you don&apos;t mind, that would be great,&quot; Titus says, finding a blank corner on the decorated map. &quot;We&apos;ll catch up. Just give us a place.&quot;"

            "In the long, dragging years after college, I thought that all I could ever want was to waste my life as efficiently as possible. ",
            "But I feel something different now as I sit in the foyer of a home I can barely afford, watching the first snow of the year lightly fall beyond the glass of my front window, sitting in a folding chair as I consider everything that brought me to this exact moment.",
            "While my mind deliberates over whether I was actually going to kill myself &mdash; or just being pathetically dramatic &mdash; I still shiver from either the chill of the outside air or fear of the inevitable. Maybe my body refuses to forget what I almost did to it, even if my mind has moved on. I sit there for what feels like hours, entranced by the stillness of the outside world as the crystalline flakes glow like fireflies beneath the street lights. My phone is still in my hand: the group text written but still unsent, and I try to draw the energy to care just a little bit more.",
            "Some time after my meager patch of brown grass is covered in a layer of white, I hear a disturbance next door. Katiya&apos;s entry door screeches open at an improbable hour in the middle of the week, hanging open a little longer than it might take for a single person to get inside.",
            "My eyes turn to the seven-segment neon numbers on the stove, reading a little after two o&apos;clock in the morning: it&apos;s far too late for Katiya when she hates drinking. ",
            "With how early she gets up for patrol, she should be asleep by now.",
            "So I grab my lacrosse stick again, scratched and battered to hell, and I stumble through the darkness towards the door as a strange wind flows out instead of in, and though I&apos;m weaker than a peasant in Katiya&apos;s world, I decide I&apos;ll try for a bluff if I have to.",
            "I  slip through Katiya&apos;s door, rushing in with the sharp end of the stick leveled, ready to confront whatever faces me. But she doesn&apos;t have the energy to tackle me this time. ",
            "And it&apos;s not because I&apos;m no longer a stranger. ",
            "Katiya stands at the entrance of her home. Nothing shines on her because she&apos;s dressed like a civilian, her hair disheveled and unbraided, and her skin sullied with dirt and grime. It looks as if she hesitates to enter her own home. I think up a joke to lighten her spirits, but quickly find it isn&apos;t the time.",
            "&quot;You never knocked,&quot; I say. &quot;For a whole week or so. I don&apos;t think I ever even heard you: quiet as a seminary mouse.&quot;",

            "I rest my lacrosse stick against the wall with her greatsword, and swiftly approach her. She trembles, still hesitating to enter like a vampire without verbal permission, so I wrap my arms around her, goading her to join me on the IKEA couch we spent a weekend afternoon jamming into her world.",
            "She doesn&apos;t say anything, so I listen to her silence. I can feel the rise and fall of her chest as she tightens herself against me, wondering what catastrophe could ever bring the strong, resilient knight to her edge like this. ",
            "I look down at her head that&apos;s coated in leaves and branches, and as I rub her back, I feel that sensation of warmth slowly return to me, though it&apos;s not the power of her Essence, and as the minutes pass, waiting for her to turn her eyes to mine and explain the past week, I find my fingers working through her hair.",
            "She snorts, halfway between a laugh and a sob. &quot;What are you doing, Cody?&quot;",
            "&quot;I thought you were training to be a knight, not a dryad,&quot; I say, gingerly tugging at a small branch snared between several strands of her golden hair.",
            "She looks up at me with her amber eyes, reddened with tears, and I feel the cool air convect the places her sorrow saturated my shirt. I shiver, and realize I&apos;ve been shivering this whole time, still paying for the consequences of my seditious sit-in against the will to live.",
            "&quot;Your hands are so cold,&quot; Katiya says. She leans back against the couch with a sniffle, taking my hand between hers, and is startled at how deathly pale my extremities are. &quot;Khiras above, Cody, what happened?&quot;",
            "&quot;I lost,&quot; I say. &quot;And I almost lost it all.&quot;",
            "&quot;Lost what?&quot; she asks, and I feel her radiant warmth spread across my pallid flesh with pins-and-needles.",
            "&quot;Lost my job. The respect of my father. And the will to live,&quot; I say, beginning to sob like Katiya as I struggle to mutter the last syllable. &quot;I think I tried to kill myself.&quot;",
            "She pauses, then pulls me closer. I expect her to ask where, and how, and why, but she just stays there, sitting in the same space of emotion that I do, refusing to leave when it&apos;s just the two of us leaning together, trading just enough heat to ward off the chill.",

He was buried in the same place I killed him, and I just walked, and walked, until I begged the ground to swallow me the same way it made him disappear.&quot;",

            "&quot;Spark?&quot; she says, and she rolls her eyes.",
            "&quot;That spark you have. You draw people to you because you feel through things so fully. I can tell you care so deeply. And it makes me feel so warm when I&apos;m with you . . . even if we don&apos;t touch.&quot;",

            "&quot;But what do I do with that feeling, when all it ever does is drag me away from the fight? I tried to save . . . Bertram . . . and thought I was being brave, but I just ended up getting him killed,&quot; she says. &quot;But what am I doing wrong?&quot;"

            "The heat makes it hard for him to keep holding on, yet he doubles down, though I can feel it makes him wince. I try to breathe though the collapse is finally happening. It feels like everything folds inward as I finally break, though his embrace so desperately holds it all together.",

            "I feel my strength slowly return. He kept me in place just long enough to reorder some of the pieces, and as he sweats from the heat, my body cools a little further.",
            "&quot;I just don&apos;t know how you do it. How you remain so cool,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;I&apos;m not that cool. I&apos;m a nerd,&quot; he says.",

            "&quot;I don&apos;t know . . . it was a new thought I&apos;d never had before. Maybe it&apos;s stupid . . . but, you know, I think I could only hear it at the absolute bottom,&quot; he says, and pauses so he can organize the words. &quot;I couldn&apos;t feel anything. I had to reason with myself over why to go on, and it was a logical battle, and all I came to is, is that the only way to live is to show up.&quot; He thinks further, assembling words like screws. &quot;The only way to succeed in being alive is just deciding to participate. For the next five seconds. Or the next five minutes. Or days, or getting out of bed, or deciding to go to the gym. Or taking a shot in the dark with some old dusty project, thinking it will get you closer to a dream.&quot;",
            "The words give me pause. &quot;But what about titles? You as an engineer, and me as a knight, and that&apos;s something we lost &mdash; something we have to fight for. To get back, to keep our honor, right? Doesn&apos;t it make you so afraid of everything you have to lose? You could die tomorrow, or get deathly ill, or the Chymaera could cross the lake tomorrow after a cold winter&apos;s night!&quot;",

But I felt so centered there: as if the world was spinning around me for once, instead of trying to hold on to a world that tried to shake me off.&quot;",
            "It makes me think of the dreams beyond the cabin when I slept in Cody&apos;s bed: all of us, alive and dead, facing the sunrise with stillness though the mountain was still obscured by trees, hiding all the things we were afraid of, all the things that kept me sitting at the window since my innocence was taken.",
            "&quot;But we have to consider the past and future,&quot; I say. &quot;We can&apos;t live in the present. That anxiety has to exist, because it saves us. Maybe we can take trips to scout that past and future when we have to.&quot;",
            "&quot;We just have to make our home here,&quot; Cody says, and now he sits on the couch with his arm around me. My head rests on his shoulder as we face my window where a light dusting of snow begins to fall, looking out into the darkness of the distant shore, no longer searching for amethyst in the veins of the trees.",
            "&quot;And I feel home when I&apos;m with you,&quot; I hear myself say, and I want so badly to turn to him again, to not duck my head beneath his in avoidance, to show my feelings without pretense of a pretend victory. But I think it&apos;s something we should work towards, after we sort these things out.",

            "&quot;No shit,&quot; I tell him. &quot;I mean when the emptiness is gone.&quot;",
            "&quot;The emptiness never leaves,&quot; he says. &quot;It just becomes less, I think, like a smaller part of the whole. Like when I had the project in school, when I was so busy and I never had the chance to be alone.&quot;",

            "&quot;Sure,&quot; Cody says, and he yawns, withdrawing the phone from his pocket. His thumb swipes between pages of the square programs, settling on the messaging app, and after brief hesitation, he presses SEND on an unsent text. &quot;I think that world would be worth it.&quot;",

And Katiya meets with Rayna&apos;s contact tomorrow, where she&apos;ll get more information. And the through line is this.&quot; I tap my toe against the only other perfect shape in the room beyond the Starbucks cups: a Pelican case, holding the prototype for my drone I shelved almost half a decade ago.",

            "I stuff my body into the eyeline, then crack the door so she can&apos;t see anything else. She looks up at me from the porch: probably thinks my hair is disheveled from days of loneliness, but I&apos;ve just been busy plotting my throes of redemption.",
            "I hear Rayna stand from behind the couch, and it frightens me: I can feel how much she&apos;s longed to reconcile. Maybe she just wants a glance of her, to see how much Aryn&apos;s changed in her absence &mdash; but she&apos;s clumsy in her reproach.",
            "I hear the dining table screech against the floor when Rayna bumps it in the dark. She gasps, and when I hear something slender and metallic slide across the surface, she grasps the utensil in her hand before it can crash to the floor.",
            "Aryn&apos;s expression quickly congeals, pushing with an intention that catches me off guard. &quot;Who&apos;s in there? Katiya, it&apos;s against regulation to house strangers!&quot;",
            "So I tell half a lie.",
            "&quot;Refugees,&quot; I say. &quot;I wanted to help. To do something when I couldn&apos;t serve.&quot;",
            "Rayna dashes for Cody&apos;s door. Titus and Sylvia step away from the opposite wall, and I hope Aryn only notices the two of them.",
            "But she doesn&apos;t. Her Ahkvasan vision is too acute.",
            "&quot;Who was that?&quot; Aryn asks. &quot;That was an Ahkvasan &mdash; or at least a demihuman like me. Blackwater doesn&apos;t have demihumans, so she&apos;s not a refugee!&quot;",
            "&quot;She&apos;s with us,&quot; Titus says: the only person in town with an expression enough to out-ice her. &quot;She&apos;s promised us work in Melenia. And Katiya offered to quarter us for the day.&quot;",
            "&quot;Melenia&apos;s more than two weeks of travel away,&quot; Aryn says. &quot;What could possibly bring her here?&quot;",
            "&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; Titus says, putting his arm around Sylvia. &quot;But we&apos;re desperate. And work is work.&quot;",
            "Aryn glares between Titus and Sylvia: from how her flesh shivers, she reacts to their immense energy that same way that I first did &mdash; and though she could surely prod further, she relents. She clenches her fists with the slightest tell of fear, slipping back through the doorway.",
            "&quot;I&apos;m not sure what I believe,&quot; Aryn says. &quot;I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on, or what you&apos;re got yourself into with these people, Katiya, but please,&quot; she looks one last time to the door her sister disappeared through&mdash; &quot;just please, tell me when you need my help.&quot;"

            "The village holds its breath longer as the nights get colder. Villagers pass every morning along the lake to watch for waves: even though only the shoreline is frozen, the ice inches faster and faster towards the center of the lake each day. Soon they&apos;ll be hurling boulders to judge whether our finest barrier is no more than a flat plane of solid ice &mdash; the Capital&apos;s already sent its first detachment to defend the village from the east, quartered in the eastern barracks.",
            "I&apos;m cloaked by the hood of my old guard uniform, wrapped by an unfamiliar green scarf that Rayna received from her informant, a scarf that identifies the connection Rayna settled on. Rayna wears the only set of clothes she owns, and Titus and Sylvia don decorated armor from their forgotten life, though they cover it with a dark shawl.",
            "The village is busy this time of day, but it&apos;s busier with all the reinforcements. We walk between soldiers from the Purgatory Line enjoying their window of respite, sampling all the goods they can stomach in the Main Street market &mdash; and it would almost feel like tourist season if their faces weren&apos;t scraped with the thrashings of war, and their bellies weren&apos;t as bottomless as the appetites of the conflict beyond the lake.",
            "We slip through the crowds, ducking arms extended with precious Kine in trade, weaving around clusters of native townies complaining about the crowd, and when we finally make it to the edge of the market, short-cutting through long alleyways, the buildings get shorter, until only a wide, barren field of frost and frozen dirt spans between the town and the old castle: where our informant awaits.",
            "My eyes begin to scan the landscape for any sign of the emissary. My fingers brush the foreign fabric of the green scarf, dry and thin like the desert, with sand still stuck between the stitches. Titus and Sylvia begin to flank around the sides as overwatch, leaving just Rayna and I to cross the middle of the field, feeling watched from behind the entire time.",
            "&quot;Where&apos;s the spot?&quot; I ask Rayna.",
            "&quot;They were intentionally vague,&quot; she says. ",
            "The crumbling perimeter walls are scattered with vagrants. We approach the entrance through which I once chased her, stopping at the steps as we wait for any sign of interaction from the strangers all around us. One leans against the wall, rambling madly with delusions. Another cooks squirrel meat on a makeshift grill, and a patchy Ahkvasan eats it raw.",
            "&quot;How will we know?&quot; I ask Rayna. &quot;What if this is a trick?&quot;",
            "&quot;It&apos;s not. This informant and I fought for our lives together: this isn&apos;t a ruse.&quot;",
            "I stare at the floor as I sit on the steps: my hood obscures vision of anything beyond the weathered stone stairs. I can feel the world&apos;s quiescence grow the more I wait, my heart beating slower as it feels like the weather is getting hotter. I thought it might be a rogue ray of light, but the sun hasn&apos;t parted the thick clouds all day.",
            "&quot;Hey Rayna &mdash; you think they&apos;re just late? Were they even expecting us?&quot; ",
            "I gasp, suddenly feeling breathless from a meager two sentences. Then I try again: this shortness of breath isn&apos;t from a feeling. ",
            "It&apos;s something else.",
            "&quot;Rayna?&quot;",
            "Sitting doesn&apos;t help, so I stand, grabbing Rayna&apos;s shoulder, but I don&apos;t feel warmth. I grab harder, but the fabric refuses to bend. She doesn&apos;t even react: still as stone, her face frozen in an expression similar to that of my cherished friend in his last moments, and the sudden panic races my heart.",
            "She&apos;s stuck like all the ancient statues of knights that the homeless tether their tarps to, forever bound to a pedestal. Her mouth is left agape, but I realize it&apos;s not from emoting a sense of terror.  ",
            "She&apos;s trying to respond to me, but she can&apos;t get the words out.",
            "Or maybe they just haven&apos;t come out yet.",
            "I descend the stairs. The air is hot wherever it rushes against my skin, and when I reach the bottom, I step to crunch the frosted grass beneath my feet.",
            "But it won&apos;t move. ",
            "My ankle twists on the fibrous fronds that refuse to give, and I nearly fall before recollecting myself, feeling such a strong sense of heat the more my muscles labor to keep me upright. The air is thin as the lack of pressure pops my ears, and with the taste of ozone in my breath, I finally look up.",
            "The world is still.",
            "I stumble over the uneven plane of grasses, stiff as steel rods, finding Titus and Sylvia in the distance. But they&apos;re not watching the steps. Something grabs their attention in the direction of the village, and without any other visual cues, I try to follow their line of sight.",
            "I head back towards Gaffesend, trying to find a sense of motion in anything as the birds are stuck in the sky; the flames of torches unwavering; the first snow of the day kept still like stars during the day. ",
            "But the strangest sight is a lone Royal Guard, still as cardstock as she stands a hundred yards away, right where Titus and Sylvia might have seen her. The fabric of her hood is contoured to the peaks of her ears. Her eyes stare directly at the old castle; her expression tense yet apprehensive; the poise of her pace swift from the way her black tail bends behind her.",
            "But there&apos;s nothing I can do to stop her, to stop Aryn&apos;s curiosity from getting the better of her. And I don&apos;t realize I&apos;ve been distracted until I begin circling again, stumbling across the uneven landscape, searching for any sign of motion as my flesh begins to sweat &mdash; the beads hanging perfectly in the air as they slip from my skin.",
            "It&apos;s only after a minute of silent stillness &mdash; around when my ears start ringing &mdash; that I see the lone, cloaked wanderer adorned with a similar shawl to my scarf approaching from the northern tree line, headed directly for me as I decide whether to run or to stand perfectly still.",
            "But the stranger decides for me. ",
            "They raise their hand, releasing me ever-so-slowly from the binds of time. I watch the positions of every one of my footsteps combust with heat as my backlog of motion cashes out &mdash; scorching the grasses &mdash; and scalding where I grabbed Rayna&apos;s shoulder with a sudden burst of flame. I&apos;m stuck between frames of entropy with nowhere to run, at the mercy of the timeless stranger."

            "Without entitlement to fast or slow, I&apos;m in a halfway home between two states of motion. It feels like these dilations of time don&apos;t even encompass my whole body anymore: my body feels slow as molasses while my mind races just as fast as it was before, giving me a headache as I turn to realize how close they&apos;ve come. ",
            "My senses fail me when the stranger excludes my nerves from this pocket of entropy. My mind pleads for information, and with only my sight in full function, it fils my thoughts with every detail I can grasp.",
            "There are two peaks that crest beneath the worn, hooded robe, but their face isn&apos;t smooth like Rayna or Aryn. It&apos;s an Ahkvasan like Naya, but their fur is a different color &mdash; and a different color that isn&apos;t natural. ",
            "But purposely unnatural: their coat is sullied with dirt, yet it doesn&apos;t look like some feral Ahkvasan that&apos;s weathered the wastelands. The roots of their fur &mdash; her fur &mdash; are radiant and impossibly golden, shimmering with more light than the world can offer, yet the strands taper off into flat, unnatural clods of brown, of dirt, and by the time this Ahkvasan&apos;s emerald eyes meet mine, I notice the missing span of her cloak that she tore to make this scarf.",
            "I&apos;m almost relieved when her hands reach me &mdash; to finally feel something touch me back after several minutes in tactile isolation.",
            "&quot;Don&apos;t panic,&quot; she says, and her voice booms with an air of veneration. My body catches up to my mind, flooded with sensory information that&apos;s ourdated, and when she tugs at my cloak, we begin racing towards the north. I can feel her tremble with exhaustion, and I can sense this grand display has costed her a substantial amount of Essence.",
            "She slows time when we approach the tree line to ensure the grass has long enough to bend, so that our footfalls won&apos;t combust in mysterious flashes of heat. When we make it to cover, the world recovers, and once again I hear all the sounds of life I took for granted beyond the pounding of my heartbeat in my temples. We catch our breath for several seconds as she rifles through her pockets, careful not to tatter the fabric with her claws. I&apos;m too stunned to speak, so I continue to let her pull me deeper into the woods, approaching the small northern lobe of Gaffesend Lake, though we surely won&apos;t be able to cross.",
            "&quot;I&apos;m sorry to petrify you with time,&quot; she says, and while I&apos;m figuring out whether she means physically or emotionally, the golden Ahkvasan pulls a spherical, green stone from inside her pockets. &quot;We need to get somewhere quiet. I understand you brought protection, but beyond Rayna, I can&apos;t trust anyone right now.&quot;",
            "&quot;This seems pretty remote,&quot; I say.",
            "&quot;We have an appointment with another. A couple hundred miles north,&quot; she says. &quot;You&apos;ve been through the bends of time, but there&apos;s one more quick voyage we have to undertake.&quot;",
            "&quot;Hundred?&quot; I repeat. &quot;But how? Are we going to fly?&quot;",
            "&quot;We&apos;re already there &mdash; that is, if she&apos;s there,&quot; the Ahkvasan says. She hands me a second smooth sphere, and I grab it, but it doesn&apos;t rotate in my hands. It&apos;s light and so easy to lift &mdash; like a paperweight, but won&apos;t twist no matter how hard I try to turn it. I feel an otherworldly energy spin my circuits, and as I hear the omnipresent words of an ancient tongue.",
            "I don&apos;t even feel my body lurch to motion, but it&apos;s  like orbiting around the Earth on one of Cody&apos;s computer maps that show his entire world, as if the still sphere refuses to move because it&apos;s connected to something else I can&apos;t see between space. My mind can&apos;t reconcile the sight of anything around me, so I focus on the sphere. The jagged marble-like surface scrolls through textures as if it ripples, but it never changes size, feeling like we&apos;re being folded and pulled in a direction I&apos;ve never felt before, and when I look up, I find the world is still again.",
            "There&apos;s a third hand touching the sphere that I grasp between my hands. It&apos;s green and calloused with veins like leaves: the fingers fibrous, cold, and resilient. The Ahkvasan touches their other hand &mdash; which holds another sphere &mdash; and when we step back, I discover this cold-blooded figure is a member of a forgotten race: a forgotten race that lives with veins, but no blood.",
            "Her two eyes are darker than night, like those of an insect, but larger than a human&apos;s. Crimson vines descend from her head beneath long, colorful leaves, giving her bangs, and her face is contoured with features like those of a grasshopper: a distinct, sharp, scraggly mouth with mandibles on the side.",
            "I feel like I&apos;m going to make sick after being bent through space and time: it&apos;s obvious these two hold a terrifying amount of power, far beyond the pale of even the strongest commoner. Most go their whole lives without meeting one of the Masks of the Gods, but I don&apos;t doubt for a second that I&apos;ve met two of them over the course of a single day.",
            "I clutch my stomach as I look around: the air is much colder, and we stand at the front of some natural amphitheater, vacant of any signs of life.",
            "&quot;Where&apos;s this waypoint?&quot; The Ahkvasan asks.",
            "&quot;Due west of Blackwater proper,&quot; the Verdalan replies. &quot;I prognosticated this position as the egress point of the leyline: traversing that long passage to scour dying rooms in the caverns of space.&quot;",
            "&quot;So the signature was here, but it wasn&apos;t...here,&quot; the Ahkvasan says. &quot;It was on another plane.&quot;",
            "&quot;A dying bubble of existence that was abandoned. So many chained together that we barely made it out  before the walls of rotting realities could consume us,&quot; she says, and then I notice the two humans standing behind her, wearing the same armor that Titus and Sylvia wear. One&apos;s bald and dark-skinned like Ryder, and the other one is a short, blonde, Demi-human girl with cat ears, but no tail.",
            "But they both look so much worse for wear. It&apos;s weird enough hearing a plant talk with a better vocabulary than I have &mdash; and it&apos;s probably not even her first language.",
            "&quot;So you&apos;re the contact,&quot; the Verdalan says, before looking to the Ahkvasan for a nod of approval. She touches one of the trees, and part of her consciousness leaves her for a second. &quot;We&apos;re safe here. Beyond the winter hare, there isn&apos;t a soul that trudges these wastes for miles.&quot;",
            "I look between the two humans&apos; faces: the only familiar sight though they&apos;re two strangers. None of us are even on a first-name basis yet.",
            "&quot;I&apos;m sorry for the cloak-and-dagger,&quot; the Ahkvasan says. &quot;I&apos;m from a place where the color of my fur is a namesake that could topple an empire.&quot;",
            "&quot;And will,&quot; the Verdalan says.",
            "&quot;My name is Jade,&quot; says the Ahkvasan. &quot;A Mask of the Gods, and the rightful heir of Melenia.&quot;",

            "&quot;She&apos;ll come to us,&quot; Aliaki says. &quot;When she rises from the depths, she&apos;ll come to the last place we met: the leyline that led us home.&quot;",
            "&quot;Then we should head south now, Romin,&quot; the girl tells her partner, tugging gently at his sleeve. &quot;The rest of our fireteam waits down there: not a chance they&apos;ve made it further.&quot;",

            "But she holds conviction in the words. &quot;Rayna&apos;s one of the best reasons we survived capture,&quot; Aliaki says, &quot;and without her, we wouldn&apos;t be here. So I trust her convictions.&quot;",
            "&quot;And you&apos;re the one that knows this town better than anyone.&quot; Jade says. &quot;You know who to call. You know every shelter and egress. You know how to find the support you need &mdash; and in the days preceding, we&apos;ll arrive to provide all the support we have.&quot;",
            "&quot;And hopefully with another ally of our own,&quot; Aliaki says.",
            "&quot;You can count on me.&quot; I insist.",
            "Aliaki rifles through a woven satchel to withdraw a map and a blank piece of parchment. She overlays the thin, blank page atop the map, and holding it in the dim light of the sky, she grows hardened indentations like bark in the paper where the contours of the landmarks shine through.",
            "Jade approaches the table, circling several critical points. &quot;The new Ahkvasan Army has already mobilized its forces. A sizable unit sneaks through the north in the abandoned lands, over here,&quot; she says, drawing a line in emerald ink. The pen dances over the hills manifested by Aliaki&apos;s Essence, and after scribbling several notes on meeting points, she rolls up the map and hands it to me.",
            "And then the meeting is over. For beings with the gifts of time and space, it almost feels like they&apos;re in a rush. Maybe it&apos;s the only chance I have to ask.",
            "&quot;So what brings together an Ahkvasan and a Verdalan?&quot; I ask.",
            "&quot;We&apos;re just two agents on an eternal campaign against the two forces of Fosroth. The Eternalists seek to manifest Essence to live forever, withholding souls from reincarnation in the Reservoir of Souls. And the Ephemeralists seek the right to die and live again.&quot;",
            "&quot;And which are you?&quot;",
            "&quot;We seek to die when the time is right,&quot; Aliaki says. &quot;That means even if that right isn&apos;t when we think it should be.&quot;",
            "&quot;Romin and Valentina will seek you out when they make the trip,&quot; Jade says, as Aliaki extends her hands with the two perfect spheres.",
            "&quot;Why don&apos;t they travel like this?&quot; I ask.",
            "&quot;You ever hear of that boat puzzle, where you can only take so many people across the river each time?&quot; Jade says. &quot;You need an initiator on each side to set the point of departure if it&apos;s a new location.&quot;",
            "&quot;This sphere is a single solid in a higher dimension, each one piercing our world at two points. Fire blind and you&apos;ll end up missing &mdash; maybe fused somewhere in the heart of the planet.&quot;",
            "I rest my hands in Aliaki&apos;s, grasping the small shape as tight as I can. Just as fish live peacefully knowing nothing of the world beyond the water, I close my eyes softly this time, wishing for nothing more than an ignorance of higher dimensions. And by the time I open my eyes, I&apos;ve already returned to the shores of Gaffesend alongside Jade, finding two familiar faces rushing to confront us."

            "&quot;It&apos;s cool, bro. We&apos;ve come a long way. I talk to my family about you guys all the time,&quot; I say, as we turn the corner of another span of double garages, finding cars parked three-in-a-line with different trophies from car shows on the walls. It&apos;s the only dirty room of the house, looking like it housed a tractor during their build process. The windows are covered, and when we enter, Pink Floyd&apos;s Comfortably Numb autoplays over the speakers.",
            "I forget we&apos;re being followed when the double garage looks like a museum of beautiful, antiquated machines: an old LeBlond engine lathe from the 1940s, and another mill with a CNC retrofit, overtaking the manual controls with automatic displays that blink red and green. The wall holds a massive tap-and-die chart that even my grandma could read without her glasses: reminding me of the old machine shop back at university.",
            "&quot;She&apos;s been itching for action,&quot; Geoffrey says, and it startles me. &quot;Sorry. I wanted to see you boys at work: white-collar management is so zoomed out from the battlefield, that it&apos;s nice to see some action from time to time.&quot;",
            "&quot;Sure,&quot; I say.",

            "&quot;It&apos;s belt-fed,&quot; I reply. &quot;You can only change speeds when it&apos;s in motion.&quot; I almost destroyed the shop&apos;s band saw yesterday &mdash; the only reason I remember.",

            "&quot;Taught me how to be on a team,&quot; I say, and Reed&apos;s eyes lighten. I drive down the table of the mill&apos;s bed like I&apos;m lowering an old car window, then lubricate the thirsty ways with a little oil. &quot;I was a lost sheep for a while. He taught me how to make friends, I think. To care a little more. I mean, goddamn, your son&apos;s like the fuckin&apos; sun&mdash;&quot;",
            "I cover my mouth when I realize I&apos;m not in the shop anymore: this isn&apos;t some temporal enclave of the 1960s, despite all the hardware. Instead, I&apos;m surprised to find that Geoffrey laughs, clapping Reed on the back.",
            "&quot;He sure is the friendmaker,&quot; his father says. ",
            "But his expression changes when he realizes the garage is about to be filled with harsh noise. ",

I came down here to tell you that the first I heard of any of that was from Reed, so as far as I know, your slate&apos;s clean.&quot;",

            "I look down at the shattered piece I&apos;ve come here to recreate. It&apos;s a stress fracture: sheared at forty-five degrees because the weight was too much, and I hope the next one is made of something better.",
            "There&apos;s so much I&apos;ve learned since the last time.",
            "&quot;I can do that,&quot; I say, tracing my finger against the malformed face of blistered metal. I grab the collet with my coolant-stained hands, chucking up an end mill with two shrill chirps from the pneumatic vise.",

            "I lack the time to explain before my allies turn on each other, and though Jade feels exhausted from bending time to a near stop, she still manages to slow the world enough for the two of us that they can&apos;t hear my words.",
            "Sylvia drew her bow with Essenced arrows as soon as we appeared in a flash of light &mdash; and when she saw my panicked expression from weathering another long, short trip, she identified Jade as the enemy, refusing to take any chances.",
            "Jade tenses the polished sphere in her claws: she might not be driving its magic, but it looks like she&apos;s the one that&apos;s now doing the pulling. A low thrum rattles the bowstring when Sylvia&apos;s nocked arrow leaves her fingers, flying fast enough to challenge Jade&apos;s grasp of time. The flint arrowhead combusts with white-hot Human Essence, and Titus unsheathes his sword, resonating with another loud hum.",
            "&quot;Aliaki,&quot; Jade mutters, and I hear someone coming to even the odds. The sphere scrolls rapidly as the anchor point shifts, and as Sylvia&apos;s first arrow crosses half the distance between our two parties, Jade reaches to grab it by its end.",
            "The blistering heat doesn&apos;t have the time to sear her flesh and fur, but she winces when she turns it back around, hurling it directly for Titus&apos; head. This extra lapse of time already burdens her enough &mdash; like holding back the flow of a powerful river &mdash; and as the world begins to settle, shuddering with the urge for progress like tired muscles on their last effort, Aliaki arrives in another flash.",
            "I reach desperately for the rogue arrow, but time no longer waits. Titus refuses to flinch though a white death stares him in the forehead, and in an instant, the flint head erupts into tiny flecks of molten rock.",
            "The shaft combusts into soot, decorating Titus&apos; face with a flash of dark powder. He thinks he has the space to charge an attack as Jade fails to negotiate any more with time, raising his sword to charge, but Aliaki clenches her fist faster.",
            "The pale light in front of us shifts blue. Twenty yards crunches into twenty inches, and before Titus can realize he&apos;s been shorted on his approach, Aliaki withdraws a plug from the large waterskin on her back, drenching her fibrous flesh. It goes dry in an instant, and she grows from a meager five feet to more than seven.",
            "Titus tries to shift his weight with fewer steps to gain momentum. I throw myself between the two of them to try to get them to stop, but I&apos;ve been shorted for just as much space.",
            "Aliaki materializes a spear she&apos;s kept in some space between spaces, and lunges at the fearless human, about to make contact with his heart before I nudge the weapon just in time. It pierces through his armpit, but Sylvia can&apos;t see his face to know he&apos;s fine: that the spear is nothing more than a graze, and when she shouts his name, she invokes a strength from somewhere within that feels more powerful than any of us.",
            "Her hair glows white with the light of a thousand suns: one trapped in each strand of hair, and we feel our bodies overcome with something ethereal that casts us to our knees. It&apos;s only when my hands touch both of their chests &mdash; a conduit of peace between Aliaki and Titus &mdash; that their adrenaline quiesces, and Titus drops the spear from between his arm, along with his blade that Aliaki condensed to a tenth of its length.",
            "&quot;Give reality a rest,&quot; I say, &quot;you&apos;re going to break it!&quot;",
            "&quot;These are surely not your friends,&quot; Aliaki says. &quot;Refugees, they said? They&apos;re lying!&quot;",
            "&quot;And who the Res are you?&quot; Titus asks: the two push against my hands, and I feel like an insect stopping two mountains of Essence from colliding, but they don&apos;t push hard. Jade catches her breath as she sits on the ground: sweat cleansing her golden coat of all the dirt, and it shimmers in the pale light.",
            "&quot;I recognize him now. It was him,&quot; Aliaki says. &quot;In the frames of every forgotten world: I saw his lifeless husks in all the realities he left behind.&quot;",
            "&quot;So he&apos;s the anomaly,&quot; Jade says.",
            "&quot;No. He&apos;s something different. And he sacrificed his gift to shed no more.&quot;",
            "&quot;I&apos;ve come to peace now,&quot; Titus says, as Sylvia takes his arm. &quot;I&apos;m an outcast for what I&apos;ve done, but if you witnessed even a moment . . . of all those ends, can you understand what it was all for?&quot;",
            "She pauses, drawing a breath of our exhale. &quot;It must have been madness. But you completed your mission.&quot;",
            "&quot;A circular path only ends when you decide to stop,&quot; Titus says. &quot;I left the circle.&quot;",
            "&quot;And it brought you here.&quot; Aliaki turns to me. &quot;Fate brings us to the same mooring point: to her, no more than a common soldier, and yet the linchpin of three Masks of the gods.&quot;",
            "&quot;So you know about Sylvia,&quot; Titus says.",
            "Jade&apos;s eyes narrow, exposing thin green slits. &quot;But she&apos;s one of the Chosen, Ali &mdash; right? Isn&apos;t it four?&quot;",
            "&quot;Her class hasn&apos;t been in this world since the Second Awakening. She&apos;s the incarnation of something far, far older: maybe she doesn&apos;t even know it.&quot;",
            "&quot;I have an idea,&quot; Sylvia says.",
            "&quot;Then it seems that fate points us all in the same direction,&quot; Jade says. She lifts herself from the ground after taking Gaffesend&apos;s dirt in her clutches, muting the shimmer in her strands. &quot;I came to tell Katiya of an ambush from the west, but what I didn&apos;t tell her . . . is that it was futile.&quot; ",
            "I squint. &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;",
            "&quot;That I was relaying a message, so your people had a chance to save themselves. Aliaki found a source of tremendous Chymaeran energy in the northern wastes of Blackwater, and she thought that if she could save them &mdash; and bring them into the light &mdash; that this Mask might be able to delay the incursion.&quot;",
            "&quot;What mask?&quot; Titus asks. &quot;There were only two. And now I&apos;m the only one.&quot;",
            "Aliaki says, &quot;They should be headed here now, shepherded by two other Blackwater refugees. That is, if she&apos;s survived the transmutation: her soul will be split.&quot;",
            "&quot;Well, is it now the whole truth?&quot; I ask. &quot;Is there anything else important that you&apos;re hiding?&quot;",
            "&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; Jade says. &quot;Aliaki and I are in the service of a greater mission than Gaffesend: to reclaim a stolen empire, and this was meant to be a warning. We were headed to Northaven&mdash;&quot;",
            "&quot;These are a people,&quot; Titus says. &quot;You&apos;re privileged to a truth, and that truth binds you to a responsibility.&quot; He grabs his wrist with all the threaded scars. &quot;That makes you their hope, even if you don&apos;t ask for it.&quot;",
            "&quot;And that hope has changed with new information.&quot; Jade looks between the four of us. &quot;They can&apos;t predict what even I was unaware of, so it means we have a real shot,&quot; then she looks at me. &quot;And you&apos;re the one that fate decides will bring this all together.&quot;"

Now we&apos;re in her old home &mdash; was Katiya hiding you here the whole time? Is that why she was so secretive? I thought she was mourning!

            "The microwave chirps, startling Aryn again. I return with the rest of my leftovers, and though they hunger to speak longer, they hunger more for what I&apos;ve served them. Aryn finds a stillness in the silence &mdash; I know that even hearing my brother chewing would be enough to make me cry.",
            "&quot;So what is your business here?&quot; Aryn asks me.",
            "&quot;I lost a sibling too. But I saw their body, and from the state it was in, I know I won&apos;t ever get a chance like you have.&quot;",
            "&quot;Lost to the war?&quot; Aryn asks, unaware she&apos;s changed to English.",
            "&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say.",
            "She reads my face, finding familiarity in the contours of my grief. &quot;I&apos;m sorry.&quot;",
            "&quot;It&apos;s alright,&quot; I say. &quot;It happened a while ago. I didn&apos;t witness it.&quot;",
            "&quot;And neither did I,&quot; Aryn says. She swirls the drink in the glass, then takes a sip to show she accepts my hospitality, and then asks, &quot;so what will you honor them?&quot;",
            "&quot;I&apos;ll fix what killed him,&quot; I say.",
            "We sit around for about another half hour, and right about when my body begins to drag my eyelids shut, dipping my head against the couch as Aryn and Rayna finally circle around to their childhood memories, I hear a door open on the other side of the world.",
            "The two instinctively jump to my defense. It&apos;s more than one set of footsteps that creak the floorboards, and before Rayna peeks through the other side, she calls Katiya&apos;s name.",
            "&quot;I&apos;m back,&quot; Katiya says. ",
            "I shamble over to see where she&apos;s been, rubbing hard at the crescents beneath my eyes so she doesn&apos;t worry about me.",
            "&quot;It&apos;s you,&quot; Rayna says. &quot;I thought you weren&apos;t safe here?&quot;",
            "&quot;That was before our forces doubled,&quot; an unfamiliar voice rasps. &quot;We&apos;re setting a return point, and then it&apos;s back through space a hundred miles north.&quot;",
            "Something changes hands. I decide not to enter.",
            "&quot;You&apos;re giving me this?&quot; Katiya asks. &quot;But won&apos;t you need it?&quot;",
            "&quot;You&apos;re the great connector. You&apos;re the hub of this entire operation,&quot; another voice says, and it sounds like it speaks while breathing in. &quot;I&apos;ll return with this anchor.&quot;",
            "&quot;And Rayna can stay with me for now,&quot; Aryn volunteers, stepping through the door.",
            "&quot;Aryn?&quot; Katiya says. &quot;Why are you here?&quot;",
            "The confusion exhausts me too much to bear. I grab the phone from my pocket, making sure to set several alarms in case I pass out &mdash; tomorrow&apos;s a day I&apos;ve set for unpaid time off, but I&apos;m going to be spending all of it preparing my creation.",
            "I don&apos;t even make it to the stairs before I decide to collapse on the couch, my feet kicked up like Miguel during my first night here.",
            "I feel something warm wrap around me before I fade from consciousness, with the feeling of something wet on my forehead. She whispers a couple words, and after the door closes, the house is finally silent."
