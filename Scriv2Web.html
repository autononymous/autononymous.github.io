        <h3>About</h3>
        <div class="sht-bodysub">
        <p class="bodytext">
          Compiling text for webnovels can suck, but it shouldn't have to. 
          That's why I developed a tool to simplify the process,
          reducing a lot of the repetitive work.
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
          This tool is designed to take a custom, compiled JSON file from 
          <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview">
            Scrivener</a> and convert it into a webnovel format. 
          It also allows you to customize the CSS for each chapter element,
          so you can make it look exactly how you want.
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
          I use this to format my stories <a href="https://autononymous.io/authors-and-stories/savantguarde/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand/#TOC">Firebrand</a> and <a href="https://autononymous.io/authors-and-stories/savantguarde/paragate/">Paragate</a>. Loaded into this program, as a template, is the first three chapters of Paragate.

          <h3>How It Works</h3>
          <div class="sht-bodysub">
          <p class="bodytext">
            This tool takes a JSON file and parses it into a format that can
            be used for posting on webnovel sites such as Wattpad, Archive Of
            Our Own, Royal Road, and DeviantArt. The resulting text is presented
            in both raw HTML and formatted HTML, depending on the site and whether
            it accepts custom HTML.
              <ul>
                <li><em>Sites Without HTML Customization:</em> Wattpad, DeviantArt</li>
                <li><em>Sites With HTML Customization:</em> Archive Of Our Own, Royal Road</li>
              </ul>

          <h3>Template Files</h3>
          <p class="bodytext">
            I've created some template files to get you started.
          </p>
          <p class="bodytext">
            Creating a new project from the template provided is an option, but don't worry: you don't have to create an entirely new Scrivener project to use this tool. All it requires
            is to (1) set up some custom metadata in the Inspector, and (2) specify the
            style of the body text.

              <ol>
                <li>Open Scrivener and select <em>File &raquo; "New Project&hellip;"</em></li>

                <li>Follow the format shown in the Binder. First level is the <strong>Act</strong>, second level is the <strong>Chapter</strong>, and third level is for each individual <strong>Scene</strong>. </li>
                <li>Proceed to compose your masterpiece, or copy & paste your content in from Google Docs/Wavemaker/etc. Make sure that the content of your story uses the "Body" style so that Scrivener can identify it later in the export process. Feel free to modify this style how you want, as it is only the name of this style that matters.</li>
                <li>When you're ready to compile, hit <em>Ctrl+Shift+E</em> or navigate to <em>File &raquo; "Compile&hellip;</em></li>
                <li>Select the Project Format labelled "Web Publishing". It should already be there in the compiling formats, but if it isn't, click the gear button at the bottom and select <em>"Import Formats&hellip;"</em> to load the custom export configuration. </li>
                <li>IMPORTANT: Make sure the "Compile For" setting at the top is for "Plain Text (.txt)". </li>

<p>&emsp;In the long, dragging years after college, all I could ever ask is to waste my life as efficiently as possible. </p>
<p>&emsp;My mind loiters in the long lull between emails, dragging the 3D model on my computer in circles. The flat fluorescents take the office closer to a colorless center: what my colleague calls &quot;suicide gray,&quot; showing no sign of winter&apos;s transition to spring. Somewhere beyond the window shades and bleached brick walls, life awakens from its slumber in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, trading the dormant golden brown for verdant green. And though the end of winter is supposed to bring that nostalgic chill, I&apos;m kept lukewarm by the hum of an unbalanced, rusted fan that rattles over any sound of nature.</p>
<p>&emsp;But I notice one thing, at least. I can smell the dry acreage of cereal grasses scattered across the Rocky Mountain foothills: a sense that only comes when it&apos;s late in the fall, or after the long winter when my nose is no longer running, when the world begins to open. It&apos;s when the late sun absorbs in the fronds of dormant fields once left to shadow &mdash; that golden hour late in the workday &mdash; when an arid essence gusts through the cracked corners of the crumbling ceiling.</p>
<p>&emsp;Our department&apos;s office is tucked in the brow of several hills that block it from a captivating view. It was home to Navidson-Monroe&apos;s Aerospace division in the sixties, still sharing a wall with the warehouse where technicians toil over our drawings. But the Aerospace team and its bean counters made their great migration in the nineties, taking their perch a couple hundred feet higher atop the foothills: glancing down upon the city of Denver, convinced their fingers feel for the pulse of the throat of the world. </p>
<p>&emsp;So then the less-sexy divisions &mdash; like us &mdash; fell down into their musty wake, too far behind the &quot;cutting edge&quot; to earn a view beyond the cutting edge. </p>
<p>&emsp;Working in the battery division of an aerospace company is like eating ice cream every day, but it&apos;s got raisins in it. A fine treat for a new graduate, but I crave something that tastes more like space &mdash; like Dippin&apos; Dots, or maybe those freeze-dried ice creams they sell at the science museum. It&apos;s like ordering a salad at a pizza place, or ordering a cheeseburger at a Mexican restaurant. Or any other food-related simile: I&apos;m just hungry and bored since it&apos;s so close to the end of the day, and I don&apos;t have any frozen meals left in the break room fridge.</p>
<p>&emsp;But maybe every dream is a Pyrrhic compromise between that first, beatific vision and half of anything you ever bargained for. When I glance out the surly glass window, cocking my head at just the right angle, I can see the same shimmering solar reflectors and satellite dishes I saw from the window of my childhood bedroom. And although the Level 01 insignia on my nametag hasn&apos;t changed in two-and-a-half years, I guess I&apos;m at least physically closer.</p>
<p>&emsp;One day I&apos;ll design rockets, I promised myself.</p>
<p>&emsp;My father said that&apos;s what it takes to chase a dream. I believe in that freedom because I don&apos;t have a choice. I&apos;m the last chance my mother and father have to see their child make it, and when I look at the wallpaper of my brother and I on the vertical monitor, I remember I&apos;m the only one who was blessed with time.</p>

<p>&emsp;I realize I&apos;m done working on the redline when my hands stop moving. Copying changes from a red-inked engineering drawing to the computer is easy enough to get lost in thought. The music from my brother&apos;s old IPod keeps the rhythm in the keys. I pop out one of the yellowed earbuds so the lyrics don&apos;t mince the words.</p>
<p>&emsp;In the title block: DUNSMORE, 03/08/16.</p>
<p>&emsp;Checked by SAKURASHIMA, 03/08/17. That means I have an excuse to let my crush Kei look at it.</p>
<p>&emsp;Designed by PRADESH, the guy who keeps giving me these  sheets with red scribbles on them, telling me exactly the changes to make, leaving no room for creativity or judgment.</p>
<p>&emsp;Control-P. Landscape. Tabloid. Margins wide, and black-and-white lines, so the the sheet looks bleaker than the office. </p>
<p>&emsp;My computer talks to the printer, sounding off a distant whir six rows down. I rise from the cubicle, untucking the collared shirt from my jeans, opposite of what I used to do when I started here. Seems most of my fellow pencil-pushers have settled on the fact that we&apos;re not flashy enough to get customer visits. That&apos;s for the suit-wearing showmen of the R&D division, off in their hangar.</p>
<p>&emsp;The paper is warm when it spins two sheets off the press &mdash; one copy of my drawing, and one copy of the reference drawing I used from the fifties. The office is so quiet that I can hear it tap against the edge of the tray. It&apos;s time for an appraisal on my work, a second set of eyes, and I return to the only other engineer near my age in this division. She&apos;s poised at her standing desk when I approach her, focused on a model of a battery enclosure.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Hey there, Kei,&quot; I say. </p>
<p>&emsp;She lifts a finger. I rest my elbow against the divide of her cubicle. She refuses eye contact, glued to some calculation as her lips move without words. Then she says: &quot;Remember seven and nine-sixteenths.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Uh . . . got it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She takes a long pause, her manicured nails clattering against the pink, wireless keyboard. Then she draws several  lines on the pad of engineering paper, scribbling several numbers down, halting at the fifth.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Okay, what was it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Six,&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Six . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And . . . twenty-five sixteenths?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Twenty-five . . .&quot; She finally looks up at me with her sapphire rings though dark bangs. &quot;What&apos;s your problem?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Lots of things. Nothing work-related,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I doubt that,&quot; she says, but cracks a smile as she takes the pages into her hands.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Do you have your Ouija board?&quot; I ask. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;For what?&quot; She asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The person who made this would be a hundred and twenty,&quot; I say. &quot;Since we couldn&apos;t call them during retirement, I thought I&apos;d try the afterlife.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;It gets half a laugh. &quot;I thought s ances were for the sales team, always trying to predict our next contract.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re able to sell things before we even design them,&quot; I say. &quot;How do they do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I wish I knew. Maybe we could get ahead for once, then.&quot; Her eyes return to the page. &quot;So what&apos;d you screw up this time?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I describe the process.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;You know, I thought Student Government in high school was the end of you asking seniors for help,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d ask one of our lifers if I wanted a senior&apos;s ideas. I figured you&apos;d spare me an oral history of hand-drafting.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure.&quot; She gestures to the far corner of her desk, stacked neatly with folded sheets. &quot;I&apos;ll get to it later today if you add it to the pile.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Later today?&quot; I ask. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s Friday,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not like I have anything else interesting going on,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;re staying late again?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Her oscillating fan wafts her perfume into the air. I&apos;m assaulted with the mental rhyme of a different late Friday, one evening when it was just the two of us, the last Friday of the year before she left for college. </p>
<p>&emsp;A memory flashes of the club room in high school half a decade ago. It was the night before the summer festival. She was sitting at the desk facing the open window. The wind caught her hair as she stapled strips of construction paper into long chains. I feel my stomach well with the same feeling I felt then, when I realized I was running out of time to make a move, before a whole year would separate us. I remember that stirring feeling of excitement when I approached her, longing for the courage to speak the words.</p>
<p>&emsp;But she acted first. </p>
<p>&emsp;The darkness of that room made it feel like the two of us spent an eternity in there, as if she was making up for the whole year I wouldn&apos;t see her, for the unrequited connection that began just a little too late. We laid there on the reading couch, facing each other, feeling each other, letting passion pass the hours before the scuttle of the midnight cleaning crew returned us to reality. And then&mdash;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Hello &mdash; Earth to Cody?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I realize I&apos;m watching her lips move instead of listening to her words. &quot;Uh . . . yeah? What?&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;How about the other three things I sent you?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Three things? Oh. The redlines, you mean.&quot; I scratch the back of my head. &quot;Still in the works. I&apos;m almost done with the second one.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s been like two weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Naveen Pradesh peeks above the wall of his cubicle, and I know exactly what&apos;s in store.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know. But with the enclosure redesign, I just&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Nav asks, &quot;How many did you finish today, Cody?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I did two of them,&quot; I say. &quot;Sir.&quot; My voice cracks. &quot;But I had to scan the old drawings through the projector, on the old computer, and...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Our team is behind. We need all hands on deck here, or else we&apos;re never going to beat all the stuff the machine shop is sending us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know that,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;ll&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You need to get in early. And you need to stay the full time. Like Kei: sometimes even longer than eight hours. Just because you&apos;re salaried doesn&apos;t mean every day can be a half-day.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I nod. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You want to be on her level, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I stumble over the response as that familiar pang of anxiety arrests me. My nails bite the flesh of my palms.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;Y-yeah,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel that poisonous feeling rise in my stomach, the same one I felt all those times before, every time my ambition was axed with sharp critique. The words that follow are well-rehearsed.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I promise I&apos;ll do better.&quot; I turn to Kei before retreating to my desk. &quot;And thanks. I&apos;ll have all your stuff done by the end of Monday.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;End of today, Cody,&quot; Nav says.</p>
<p>&emsp;It takes everything not to give in.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure, boss,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;m on it.&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;I retreat to my desk to doom-scroll through social media, trading the personal feeling of apathy for a more global feeling of hopelessness. It fills me with a certain kind of despair when I see all the marriage announcements of friends and acquaintances, like I&apos;ve continuously been behind since I never dated in college: not even Kei. I had some fun, but I was too busy for anything meaningful. And as the only child left in my family, my parents beg for grandchildren like I used to beg for sleepovers on the weekends. My profile says I&apos;m single, and it hasn&apos;t changed since the end of high school when a different childhood friend and I tried to hit it off. But like Kei and I the year before, it was just too late.</p>
<p>&emsp;I can&apos;t help but keep scrolling to pass the time. It does little to release the burnout of five continuous hours.  If it&apos;s not social media, it&apos;s something else: endless politics; global warming; celebrity nonsense; social turmoil. And eventually &mdash; as I always do &mdash; I close the app just to open it again.</p>
<p>&emsp;The last sliver of the workday passes. I manage to grind out the third redline a couple minutes before 4:40. I used to get in so early to be ahead of all the others, but now I get in a little after 9:00 and work until everyone else has left, jog my mouse for a while, then either change into gym clothes or head straight home. </p>
<p>&emsp;Naveen surprises me before I can pack my bag. He approaches with his backpack over his shoulder, ready to start his weekend. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Cody. Make sure you get in early on Monday &mdash; I know you tend to get in rather late.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, yeah. Sure thing, Nav,&quot; I tell him, stuffing down the aftertaste of our exchange. &quot;Is there something before the stand-up meeting? It&apos;s not on the calendar.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The rest of the team talked about it last night at our Thursday get-together. I was about to leave right now until I realized you weren&apos;t there to hear it.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;His expression is distraught. The pang of fear seizes my stomach again. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is it?&quot; I manage.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s a meeting on Monday, nine A.M., about the new contract,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We have that in the bag, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No. It&apos;s not looking good.&quot;    </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not good? What does that mean? As in less work? Or...&quot; My stomach turns further with the call of the void. If it&apos;s really that, and the grim reaper in HR is sharpening her scythe, I&apos;d think the surprise meeting would have happened today, giving us a weekend to mourn our benefits.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not sure yet. But I promise you guys will hear anything they tell me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I swallow. If there&apos;s one good thing I can say about him, it&apos;s that he&apos;s always transparent.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. Thanks, boss.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, shifting the weight of his Jansport backpack, still hanging there as if he&apos;s trying to remember something.</p>
<p>&emsp;I try at humor.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Hey. If it&apos;s catered, I&apos;ll get there whenever you want me. You know this company runs on grocery store donuts.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sure there will be something.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;He smirks a little. Feels like joking with my doctor at a well-check, or the cashier&apos;s response when the unscanned item should be free. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There was one more thing,&quot; he says, lingering there. &quot;There was something you told me last week . . .&quot; His words are followed by the silence of the empty cubes and the 3D printer&apos;s persistent whine. He&apos;s trying to remember something, and after a couple seconds of scratching his chin, it finally hits him. &quot;Oh yeah &mdash; you get to move into the new place today, is that right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; I say. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Congratulations.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks. My parents are helping me unload my stuff. But Mom seems kind of sad, though.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. Took my wife a while to get over it when Raj left,&quot; Nav says. &quot;But he went out of state, though.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. Nice,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Off to California.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s cool,&quot; I add. &quot;Just like I did.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Great,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. For Silicon Valley,&quot; he says. &quot;Computer science.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Wow,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. For some startup. He says he&apos;s enjoying it,&quot; Nav says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sweet,&quot; I add, completely tapped out on adjectives.</p>
<p>&emsp;He shifts the weight of his backpack, steadying his square-frame glasses. &quot;Well, congrats. It&apos;s a big step. You&apos;ve earned it, my friend,&quot; he says, with a light smile. &quot;Just don&apos;t lift so much this weekend that you sleep in.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yep. Nine A.M. sharp. And free coffee,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;Always,&quot; he says, giving the same thumbs-up he does at the end of any day. &quot;Thanks for getting those redlines done.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I nod. Then my computer times out from half an hour of inactivity before I can lock it.</p>
<p>&emsp;I stare at the reflection, struggling to reconcile what I see. A silhouette of overgrown, short brown hair glares back at me, his stubble long past five-o&apos;clock, roughly combed into a corporate shape. His expression is sunken like melted wax, crescents etched beneath his sockets, and melting further every day. </p>
<p>&emsp;Below the monitor, a hefty pile of work is bottomless. I can&apos;t bring myself to touch the rest of it today, so instead I hide my head in my hands, trying not to wet my palms with my eyes. A couple minutes pass after the electronic door clicks behind Nav, and another row away, the gentle sound of keystrokes cease their clatter.</p>
<p>&emsp;My screen lights with something in the lower-right corner.</p>

<p>&emsp;I fumble the login twice before I send the reply.</p>

<p>&emsp; I can hear her heels in the linoleum crossway before she reaches the flourescent-bleached carpet, and I&apos;m quick to wipe my eyes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Hey, Cody. I&apos;m sorry I caused all that. I know Nav can be pretty direct about things,&quot; Kei says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, it&apos;s fine. He&apos;s right, and it doesn&apos;t bother me . . . but,&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But what?&quot; She asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;I perk my ears to the rest of the office, to ensure we&apos;re the only ones left. It still comes out as a raucous whisper.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I&apos;m just so tired, you know?&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;The sadness crystallizes to anger, and I pull a restrained splinter of it out of me. &quot;So when do I get to design something? Where&apos;s the industry life that University sold to me? All those senior projects that let us play pretend, tossing us three hundred bucks a team to think up inventions that might change the world. It&apos;s no wonder that none of our professors tried living in the real world.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She nods. &quot;No kidding.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I thought every day in industry would be fun. Hell, I was like one of those graduating preschoolers, you know, saying he wants to be a cop so he can &apos;shoot bad guys&apos; . . . or whatever it is that Paw Patrol tells your little brothers the criminal justice system is about.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She laughs hard enough to snort. It&apos;s too late to cover her mouth. &quot;They&apos;re in middle school now, so I don&apos;t think they watch that stuff anymore. They&apos;re into anime now.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But all we get to do is fix mistakes. Everything that exists in this company has already been designed, and we&apos;re just left with the paperwork.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I thought you loved paperwork,&quot; Kei says. &quot;You were so good at it during our campaign in Student Gov.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because you made me do it. That&apos;s all a Vice President is good for.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Please, Cody. You were good at more than that,&quot; she says. </p>
<p>&emsp;My heart almost skips a beat. But she&apos;s talking about the work.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Tell me,&quot; I ask. &quot;How long have you been here?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She counts the seasons on her fingers. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;About three years. Roughly one more than you&apos;ve been here &mdash; because I got out of college a quarter early.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And when did you move up?&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;She seems reluctant, as if it will hurt me. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Please, just tell me,&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;After . . . a year and two months, but we were busy, you know, and projects kept flowing. They could afford it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I turn away from the monitor. My eyes settle on the shadow cast by the Space Division building. &quot;I&apos;ll get there. And to the next thing, I know. It&apos;s just going to be a while.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re a good worker. And you&apos;re doing fine,&quot; she says. I can feel her hand on my shoulder, sending sparks through my nerves. &quot;There&apos;s a reason I picked you to run with me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So it wasn&apos;t just looks,&quot; I say. &quot;Or my cultural background. I know I tested well with the Lacrosse Bro demographic.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You were one of them. But, no, that&apos;s not why.&quot; She shares a genuine smile. &quot;You should know you&apos;re more than any of that,&quot; she says, looking at me the same way she used to &mdash; but I know better now than to read any further. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You should go home. You&apos;ve been working on that last redline for three days, and now it&apos;s over. Call it a week.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s only four-thirty,&quot; I say. &quot;How long have you been here?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Since six or so.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you&apos;re a better woman than I am.&quot; Then I add, &quot;Since I&apos;m not.&quot; Then I add, &quot;A woman, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Enough,&quot; she laughs. &quot;Go set up your new place. And you know . . . I&apos;d love to stop by and check it out sometime.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My heart skips. &quot;Sure,&quot; I say. &quot;And . . .&quot; maybe we could stop by after a movie this weekend?</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what?&quot; She asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And . . . I&apos;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ll see me Monday,&quot; she says. &quot;Don&apos;t come in tomorrow. Even I won&apos;t be here.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I thought you slept here,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not on the weekends. Just set your alarm on Sunday: you can&apos;t be late again.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;She returns to her row. I gather my things, throwing my bag over my shoulder to go home and recover from this exhausting brand of restlessness. </p>
<p>&emsp;I pass her row of cubes lit by a single light from her pink lamp. She&apos;s comfortably buried in the stacks of drawings, and I find a part of me wondering how I ever found the strength to carry that weight.</p>

<p>&emsp;He said that I would never find peace in shouldering the weight of all the world. He said it wasn&apos;t because I was weak, or that I was naive &mdash; or that I wasn&apos;t aware of all the reasons we had to be afraid.</p>
<p>&emsp;He said it was because those feelings were wasting my life. And then he died the next day in his sleep: burned alive with his youngest progeny that lacked the strength to fight back.</p>
<p>&emsp;My father made the same mistake that all the other villagers make, thinking that suffering is only caused by change. They think the discomfort in their everyday lives is just an affect of higher forces &mdash; whether by the whims of the Gods or the everlasting hunger of our war. They assume the rare breadths of stillness are caused by a break in the action: that war and its wreckage are just the affects of an empire&apos;s ambition; that all the fighting is only driven by greed.</p>
<p>&emsp;That if we stopped fighting, no one would have to die.</p>
<p>&emsp;They fall to that temptation to live the lie, to say it so long and loud that they think their words can incarnate it. Gods know it&apos;s as effective as sleeping beneath barricades of bedsheets to ward off the Chymaera, hiding as the East shakes the ground with its ravenous hunger.</p>
<p>&emsp;But they&apos;re wrong. They have no idea of how much violence has to happen just to keep things exactly the way they are.</p>

<p>&emsp;I hoped this week would never come. </p>
<p>&emsp;Six months have passed since we arrived here. We were taken straight from graduation, the first time they hitched wagons to motorcars instead of horses.</p>
<p>&emsp;It was as soon as we dropped our bags in the barracks that the Royal Guardsmen kept us busy in every waking moment, spending every second of daylight training in the militarized city of Gaffesend. And every night, I found myself at the taverns (though I never touched so much as a drop of ale), dragging my boyfriend Jullian out of the barracks until light crested over the horizon; refusing to be alone; begging to forget the impermanence of this small breadth of freedom.</p>
<p>&emsp;Yet that freedom ends today. </p>
<p>&emsp;I find myself here in Gaffesend Tavern, sitting at a bartop, watching the bustling narrow street in front of the grand lake, wondering why Jullian hasn&apos;t bothered to approach me. I hate drinking because it always makes me feel like I&apos;m too weak to face reality. Before long, I realize I&apos;m not watching the exits &mdash; and the more I keep pace with my male comrades, the more I find some stupid hope that this dizziness might shake my own feelings loose. I swirl the crimson ale around in the wooden mug to free the bubbles, envying how easily they float to the surface. </p>
<p>&emsp;An hour passes since the close of labour. The cobblestone streets bustle with villagers returning home from a long day&apos;s work. There are four of us that watch from the window, entranced by the balance of energy between two worlds. Now is that rare hour when the drunken stupor of the pub&apos;s regulars matches the stumble of the tiresome commoners. The sun has already vanished below the mountains, but its colorful influence reflects across the lake.</p>
<p>&emsp;I get the spins as my childhood friend Bertram talks to Ryder and Cae, two shy recruits that would sit alone if we weren&apos;t all friends. None of us would be here if they weren&apos;t dangling the keys to our new homes at the end of it, forcing us all to weather the best and worst of our graduating class. Somewhere behind us, the others laugh and cheer. They&apos;ve convinced themselves that this transition is a triumphant victory, too shortsighted to see that life in Gaffesend rides on the results of an enervating final test. </p>
<p>&emsp;There&apos;s no more simulations, practice runs, or drills. Failure is a one-way ticket to the front lines, and I will never get another chance.</p>
<p>&emsp;I take another sip, coaxing that feeling of joy to wash over me. I can tell that Bertram thinks the same thoughts when his eyes rest on the village on the other side of the lake. He nudges my right arm before opening his mouth to speak, gesturing to the twelve other trainees behind him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;To them it&apos;s just a random assignment, no more than the toss of a coin. But to you and I, and maybe Ryder, this is divine. This is the will of the Gods, Katiya. This is the first sentence in our declaration of war.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I tell him it is, and with my next swallow of ale, I prove it.</p>
<p>&emsp;The details are hazy. My mind protects me by forgetting everything I witnessed as a young child, and the harder I push to excise them, the deeper they dig. All I have left is the memory of Bertram pulling me from the smoldering cabin, dragging me to my mother Stella so that our fractured families could escape to the south.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;For years I was so angry,&quot; I tell him. &quot;If I could have joined the forces then, I would have put off all the schooling. I would have gone straight to the front lines to find justice for what they did to us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So why didn&apos;t you?&quot; He asks with a smirk.</p>
<p>&emsp;I shrug. &quot;How could all Chymaerans be evil if there are people like Pax that have their blood?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I gesture to the half-blooded halfwit behind us. Paxton uses his Chymaeran Essence to try to freeze the watered-down liquor, enough to stack a seventh shot glass as the others cheer him on, drawing the attention of all the other patrons. Even Ryder puts his book down for a second to watch, letting out a small chuckle as it wavers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You have honor and a kind heart, and it&apos;s what I like about you. What I always have,&quot; Bertram says. He leans close enough that I can feel his firm shoulder press against mine. &quot;But keep enough of that anger. If we don&apos;t make the program &mdash; or if the enemy breaks the lines and crosses the lake in the winter &mdash; that fury is the only thing that&apos;s going to keep us alive.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Rest assured it runs in my circuits with the Essence,&quot; I tell him. &quot;The long winter ends with our probation. It&apos;s spring now, and we have a&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My words cut short when the tower crashes on the eighth glass. Pax presses his face to the table&apos;s surface, sucking up whatever he can of the liquor and the attention. </p>
<p>&emsp;But I still find that I&apos;m unable to escape the gravity of that feeling &mdash; that dragging desire that&apos;s followed me since the beginning. The desire to have that one moment that validates all of it, that makes it all worth something. And I pray to the Gods that longing is stronger than the fear of what lies ahead. </p>

<p>&emsp;It all starts when Chief Aldrin climbs the small stage. Tonight it&apos;s edicts instead of music, and he takes a swig from his mug to make sure the words sound like a toast instead of orders.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It was three months ago that you all graduated in the top of your class. Instead of heading straight to the front lines, you were chosen to challenge yourself with a higher purpose. You demonstrated that you might have what it takes to join our ranks full-time. And starting tomorrow, you&apos;ll get your chance to prove yourself as something special.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Aldrin Valensend pauses expecting cheers, but he&apos;s met with silence. The cadets&apos; faces fall when reality crashes their party.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Or else it&apos;s off to the meat grinder,&quot; Ryder mutters, closing his book on an earmarked page. &quot;The machine is hungry again.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;So hungry they&apos;d let in women like me, I think. To wear the men&apos;s leftovers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;S-so hungry they&apos;d let in outsiders like me, I guess.&quot; Cae&apos;s ears twitch as she mutters into her cup. The Ahkvan swishes her tail with apprehension, and when Aldrin opens his mouth to try to rally us again, she withdraws her face from the mug, saturating the bronze fur on her face with a fine mustache of suds.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Look. I can tell you&apos;re all nervous,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s why I have the kegs here, to try to loosen you up a little,&quot; he says, taking another swig as if it will get him one sip closer to connecting with us. &quot;Trust me, lads. There&apos;s fear in every class &mdash; I&apos;ve seen fifteen in my time, and the reaction is the same every night before. But I want you to understand that you are not fighting for a limited number of slots. There is not a set number: you have already proved your excellence in the Capital. And if you keep that excellence, you will join us. I mean, Katiya&apos;s brother Erik joined us last year.&quot; He turns to me for validation. &quot;Didn&apos;t Erik say it wasn&apos;t that bad?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;It wasn&apos;t bad for his health, at least. Without all the drinking, he dropped a near twenty pounds.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The cadets chuckle, and Aldrin looks a little more self-assured.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I can assure you that the last three months is a hard as this probation gets.&quot; He holds up a stamped sheet of vellum scrawled with ink. &quot;You see this page?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;We all recongize it immmediately. It was taken straight from the posting board outside the field office.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;This system hearkens back to the old days. Back to those centuries ago when the world was vastly unexplored: those centuries when bands of brave adventurers took tasks to be paid in Kine, back when the empire&apos;s reach was shorter. When ruins and old dungeons were unexplored, before we could raise whole armies with the singnal single &mdash;&quot; he stutters, wetting his tongue with another sip&mdash; &quot;erm, single signal, of a wire.&quot; He waves the document in his hand, and the air is quiet enough to hear the heavy wax seal shake the paper. &quot;This is the lifeblood of our operation. We call them quests.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The cadets cringe. As if any of these tasks could be considered heroic, I think.</p>
<p>&emsp;Bertram nudges me. &quot;Did this process come out of a fable?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s not slaying monsters. Or, at least, not most of them. Maybe one of our elders has a problem with rats that savaged her Essenced crops, and they might start a fire if they gnaw the wires. Maybe it&apos;s a domestic dispute that needs authority. Or maybe it&apos;s a family near the eastern border that wants to feel safe.</p>
<p>&emsp;Those are the ones I&apos;ll take, I think.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And then there&apos;s the ones that take a little more courage. Scouting positions. Thrusting yourself just a small distance beyond the lines to make sure there&apos;s nothing there, prodding at the Purgatory Mountains with one of our mentors.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My stomach drops at the thought, but I hate that feeling.</p>
<p>&emsp;He concludes, &quot;These are the quests you will be completing. And there is always an overwhelming number of them, so you will never have a dull moment. And&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;A cadet cuts him off without raising his hand.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So what, then, we just do them?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You want to wait for me to finish, Pax? Gods above,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;Yes. You take them. You finish them. And you get them signed off and stamped by the ones that wrote them, whether they&apos;re townsfolk or the Knights of the Royal Guard. You hold on to them, and every month you submit them.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I can predict the next question before he asks it. All I wonder is if he&apos;ll raise his hand this time, and surely enough:</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, do we have to do some of the hard ones, or else we&apos;ll be sent to the war?&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;The nervous air breaks with laughter. Pax&apos;s hand is raised this time, and it stays there.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, of course not. Remember when I said you already proved yourselves? This is only about reaching a minimum.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of how many?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Shut your mouth, Pax,&quot; Ryder says, but he cracks a smile. The room&apos;s laughter grows.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of . . . no number, Gods damn it!&quot; Aldrin balls his fists, but finds relief at how the joyful spirit returns to his young cadets. &quot;You&apos;ll do as many as you think is right. And we&apos;ll see how many you do.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;We all seem to feel a little better. The Ahkvas telegraph their feelings the easiest: I can see Cae&apos;s frayed tail loosen as she relaxes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So.&quot; Aldrin clears his throat. &quot;I know that small chance scares you, but I want you to forget it. You&apos;ve worked for years and years to get out into the world beyond the capital, and here you are! You better be damn sure that you live up to that. Get closer with the people of our town. Assimilate yourself into our community. Spend time with your comrades between quests: go hike a trail, head to the hot spring on a day off, and listen well to the senior guardsmen, all right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sir, yes sir!&quot; we shout from habit.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, no! This isn&apos;t training anymore. Stop that,&quot; he barks. &quot;Work hard and live well. Make this time feel like you&apos;re the adventurers of the old days. And, please &mdash; do something other than drink here every night, understood?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sir-&quot; We hesitate, raising our mugs instead.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Fill up, lads,&quot; he says. &quot;A toast to your future!&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;The fledgling Royal Knights form a line at the kegs, their mugs wavering as suds spill across the warped wooden floorboards. We raise our full cups as color drains from the sky, and somewhere across Lake Garrison, the faint amethyst glow of Chymaeran Essence emanates from the silhouetting pines.</p>
<p>&emsp;I throw back another two fills on a challenge, and not long after, I find myself among the last of our group. Most of the others left to explore their new townhomes as official trainees of the Royal Guard. Cae and Ryder vanished as soon as possible. Some of the others dragged Pax outside so he wouldn&apos;t vomit on the floor, and I haven&apos;t seen him since.</p>
<p>&emsp;Jullian is still distant, chatting in the corner with his group of friends. Bertrand sits next to me on the long wooden bench in the corner, careful to keep us from touching though he sits rather close, enough for me to smell the booze on his breath.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You know,&quot; he stammers, &quot;I haven&apos;t said something for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What something?&quot; I ask, afraid to risk standing or else I&apos;ll crash through the coffee table. I twirl the key around my finger in the opposite direction of the twisting world.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Something ever,&quot; he says, then clarifies, &quot;Ever said, yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ever? Like, ever ever?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ever,&quot; he says. &quot;Never, I mean. And I don&apos;t know if now is the right time.&quot; Bertrand looks almost uncomfotable. His blue eyes rattle in his skull when he tries to look at me, brushing his dark hair to the side. &quot;I&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;A hand grabs my arm. It&apos;s Jullian.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s time to go home, Katiya,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But why?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because we have to get up early tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;For what?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;For the first day of work, remember?&quot; He says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I struggle to focus my mind, but I manage to ask the question. &quot;Then why in Khiras&apos; name did the Commander plan a party the night before?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Jullian pauses for a second, while Bertram nods in agreement. &quot;That&apos;s actually a really good question,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;Maybe as a test? Or just so he can scold the ones that don&apos;t show up tomorrow?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I mutter something even I don&apos;t understand when my stomach tries to transition from sitting to standing. My body goes limp when he escorts me from the couch.</p>
<p>&emsp;Jullian turns to Bertram. &quot;You should leave, too.&quot; He returns an uncomfortable glare when Jullian stabilizes me in an embrace, muttering something about him being mad because his parents gave his name too many L&apos;s.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I guess we&apos;re going,&quot; I tell Bertram.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, get home safe,&quot; he mutters, losing his campaign against gravity as his body crashes against the vacant bench.</p>
<p>&emsp;Jullian&apos;s thin as a reed, but he&apos;s strong enough to escort me from the pub. The air is crisp and cold when we step outside. Our boots crunch in the melting frost from winter&apos;s last snowstorm, and we find a relief from the humidity of twenty-some cadets. Beneath his bangs of dirty blonde hair, he always seems to hold a permanent look of discontent, but I know it&apos;s not because he&apos;s angry.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why didn&apos;t you join me? Sitting with all the quiet ones,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re my friends,&quot; I tell him. &quot;And they could be yours if you spent more time with all of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He tensions his fingers in mine. &quot;You still could have come by, though.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;And so could you, I think, but it&apos;s less effort to just apologize. &quot;I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know you&apos;re satisfied with the friends you have, but I just want to meet new people. And, compared to the city, our assignment here feels like a second chance for someone like me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I pause for a moment. &quot;What do you mean, &apos;a second chance?&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, no! I mean, I wasted so many years of my life afraid to make friends. It was so easy to tell myself that I shouldn&apos;t bother trying &mdash; that I was too busy taking care of my brothers when my mother spent her days slaving away on the looms.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I nod, coaxing him to continue.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So many of my younger years I wasted. That was until you came along and showed me that I was more than that, that I was worth it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you are worth it,&quot; I say. &quot;You should know that.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But do you see what I mean? Most days it feels like I can&apos;t even speak right. You spend you days with one core group of friends because you&apos;ve already figured it out, but every time I gather the courage to speak, it feels like a performance.&quot; He sniffles from the cold. &quot;You&apos;re a bird that was pushed out of the nest at just the right time to learn to fly, but I never left the nest. And now my body is so much heavier, and my wings feel so uncomfortable.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve always said you can practice with me,&quot; I tell him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it comes so naturally to you, though. You&apos;re so beautiful. The world begs for you to interact with it, but I&apos;m just average-looking.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;re saying that all I have going for me is my looks?&quot; I grab the collar of his shirt as I slur the words, but not hard enough to come off as real anger. &quot;That&apos;s all you think of me, huh, that I&apos;m just a dazzling piece of arm candy? I&apos;m a Gods-damn warrior!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He stutters over an apology. Maybe he still struggles to tell the difference between anger and sarcasm. My hands tension further around his shirt, and I derive an odd pleasure from seeing him squirm a little here and there.</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel my fingers trace past his left ear, grazing the hairs of his neck before I draw him down to my height. &quot;Then maybe you can show me with your actions, if the words aren&apos;t enough.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He hesitates for a moment, but the resonant pull of our bodies&apos; Essence is too strong. I can feel his heartbeat hasten as the feeling goads him closer. I plant kisses on his neck, and for several minutes, we allow our anxieties to precipitate the act that absolves them.</p>
<p>&emsp;The lamplighter walks around us, using his Essence to light the streetlamps, and I nearly lean the two of us into a bush. I can feel him surrender to his instincts when his arms embrace me, and below, I can feel evidence of his excitement.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I think we should get home,&quot; he says. &quot;To yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My free hand fumbles for my pocket, then in my pocket, for the iron key labeled BREAKEY-HILDE. It surprises me how well I can do two things at once.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But my stuff from the barracks is still outside,&quot; I say. &quot;I have to unpack!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then we&apos;ll toss it inside,&quot; he says. &quot;You can unpack tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;&quot;I can unpack it all tomorrow. Let&apos;s just toss it all inside.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But you have to unpack,&quot; my mom says. &quot;All the stuff from your bedroom is still in our living room!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;It surprises me how incapable I am of doing two things at once. As I approach my car, my free hand fumbles in my pocket, searching for my keys, and I grab them by the piece of painters&apos; tape that&apos;s still stuck to the new house key.The blue strip is scribed in Sharpie with the name DUNSMORE, and as I flip it around with a single hand to grab my car key, I nearly trip down the switchback of concrete stairs leading to the parking lot, launching my keys into the air.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What happened?&quot; My mother asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Nearly tripped down the stairs,&quot; I say. &quot;You know the aerospace guys have an elevator? Their entrance looks like some kind of brutalist doomsday bunker. Our stairway is so worn from forty years, it&apos;s practically a slide.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; she says. &quot;Well, we said we were going to do this today, and Dad has his RV convention tomorrow morning, so we can&apos;t do it then.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He doesn&apos;t have to help,&quot; I say. &quot;I literally got my degree in how to measure stuff. I&apos;m more than capable of drilling holes in the wall, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But you know how excited he is to help you, Cody,&quot; she says. &quot;He wouldn&apos;t stop telling the Richards at dinner how excited he is that his boy&apos;s moving out. &apos;Forging his own way,&apos; I think he said.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Really?&quot; I stoop down to grab the keys, careful not to twist my damn ankle even further. &quot;It&apos;s spring now. Who&apos;s going to mow the lawn the way he likes it? I don&apos;t think any of the neighbor kids are gonna mow it twice just so it can have that fancy &apos;checker&apos; look. They can&apos;t be bought off with ice cream like me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re doing that thing where you try to change the subject,&quot; she says. &quot;We&apos;re coming over today, Cody,&quot; then adds, &quot;at least we&apos;re getting it over with. Then you won&apos;t have to see us for a week.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not like that,&quot; I insist. &quot;You guys are everything to me. Why do you think I moved so close? So you can do my laundry?&quot; I trundle through the vacant, dusty lot as I hold the end of the key to my chin, spamming the lock button. A few steps later, my Subaru chirps in response: one of the few cars left in the hundred-car-lot, parked in the last spot left against the tall barbed-wire fence. Drained of my stamina after three emails and a few redlines, I try not to audibly sigh, doing the math on how much time I have to relax before we spend the rest of the evening playing Tetris with my furniture.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, we love you. And we want you to know how proud of you we are. Our boy is moving up in the world. A mortgage? And his first house?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Old, I know. I&apos;ll check the mail tomorrow for my AARP card.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And maybe next, you&apos;ll find that special person.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I groan. &quot;You&apos;ll get your grandkids when you get them.&quot; I finally break the long shadow of the Aerospace division&apos;s building when I make it to the fence, feeling the setting sun warm the back of my neck. &quot; I&apos;ll talk to you later.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re proud of you,&quot; she insists.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; I say, hinging open the car door to deposit myself in the driver&apos;s seat as shadow consumes the full span of the lot. I turn the key and the engine hums to life, taking one last glance to the top of the crumbling stairwell to confirm Kei&apos;s refusal to start her weekend. </p>
<p>&emsp;But her Ford Fiesta is still here, collecting dust as the last car on the lot.</p>
<p>&emsp;Alone, I still feel a small sense of warmth inside me. A part of me is glad I chose to stay close. Beyond that oasis of unrelenting love is a desert, and when I&apos;m not surrounded by the family that help me forget, it&apos;s a boundless journey where the scenery never changes, just like those long stretches of barren road when I drove to university, on long breaks between semesters. </p>
<p>&emsp;Maybe that&apos;s why I find comfort in returning home to the forest, where the horizon is obscured by trees. When I drive home from a long day at Navidson-Monroe, slithering down switchbacks of the Shaleborough foothills in my WRX, I watch the graduation tassle from high school sway with the curves, feeling a hint of the same exhilaration when my friends and I used to drive the other way, climbing the asphalt turns until the roads switched to trails, settling somewhere between the mountains for another adventurous chapter in a childhood summer.</p>
<p>&emsp;But the sun has set, and the association I had with this road has been wholly overwritten with the feelings I&apos;ve carried home. Nav&apos;s words seem to follow that feeling of residual guilt when I consider how behind I always am. Time used to be segmented in semesters, quarters, and classes, but the demands of the customer are endless and indivisible. </p>
<p>&emsp;At least it means that business is well &mdash; far better than being afraid of layoffs.</p>
<p>&emsp;When I crank up the playlist my friends and I made together, lower the sun roof, crack the windows, and allow the throttle to twist my stomach as I accelerate around the curves, I find I&apos;m able to let those cherished memories win over.</p>
<p>&emsp;And then a call comes over the hands-free system.</p>

<p>&emsp;I press the button on the steering wheel, and CALL ACTIVE flashes in segmented letters on the LCD. Hearing his voice over the phone makes it feel like he&apos;s speeding around the curves in the car in front of me, calling to ask if we can stop off at Sonic for a milkshake before we unpack the tents from our cars.</p>
<p>&emsp; But many years have passed since those summers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Hey, buddy.&quot; His voice is raspy over the phone. &quot;How have you been?&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Pretty good, Scott,&quot; I say, making sure to pitch my voice up.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just wanted to call to check in with you. I saw you just got a new place in our hometown. Congrats!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; I tell him. &quot;And I saw you got a new place around Orange County. A full-size house?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You know how Kaycee&apos;s parents are,&quot; he says. &quot;I guess it&apos;s what happens when you&apos;re an only child.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I wish it worked that way for me,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So then I guess I should thank you for setting us up,&quot; Scott says. &quot;What about you? Any progress in your love life?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not yet, buddy. I&apos;m starting to think I missed the chance.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I always thought you&apos;d get together with Kei. Didn&apos;t you tell me last time that she works with you?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My fingers tension around the steering wheel, and I find I&apos;m taking the turns sharper. &quot;I&apos;m not so sure, but I&apos;m doing what I can.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not just calling to check up on you. I&apos;m calling for two things. First, I wanted to tell you that Kaycee and I are gonna be in Colorado in a couple weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, really? That&apos;s great,&quot; I tell him. &quot;We should meet up.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Absolutely. And it&apos;s tied in with the second thing.&quot; Scott takes a long pause, and the phone&apos;s static gives way to the hum of my car&apos;s engine. &quot;I proposed to Kaycee, and she said &apos;yes.&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. That&apos;s fantastic!&quot; I tell him. &quot;I&apos;m so happy for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you&apos;ve been my closest friend since the beginning. I wanted this to be a question I ask you in person, when we drive out there, but . . . I want you to be in my wedding. I&apos;ve thought about it a while, and, well . . . I was wondering if you would be my Best Man.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel a rare feeling of elation overtake me. &quot;I would be honored to be that for you, Scott.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Great! Great,&quot; he says. &quot;We can talk about it more when I head out there. From the championship lacrosse team with you and Miguel, to all those sleepovers in your basement, to those summer trips up to the mountains, I mean, you&apos;ve been there for all of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I drive down that same road we took camping every day,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, you finally made it into Navidson-Monroe, you nerd. Designing rockets?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not quite yet,&quot; I tell him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you&apos;ll get there. And at this wedding, if you haven&apos;t confessed your feelings to Kei, I&apos;ll get you together with one of Kaycee&apos;s bridesmaids. You know California &mdash; she&apos;s got some really pretty friends. And Kylie&apos;s gonna be there too. The &apos;Burnett&apos;s girl,&apos; remember? Didn&apos;t you guys hit it off in the freshman dorms?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I laugh. &quot;Thanks, buddy. I&apos;ll look forward to it, then.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure.&quot; He pauses for a moment, as if deciding whether to end the call. My thumb feathers the END CALL button on the steering wheel, but then he pipes up.</p>
<p>&emsp;His voice cracks: &quot;You know, you were the one that brought all of us together. You were the &apos;uniter&apos; of all our friends, I guess. And the further I get from those years, you know . . . I miss that.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My grasp loosens on the steering wheel as I struggle to remember the last time I ever hung out with more than one person at a time. Sometimes it feels like adulthood just gives us more convenient excuses to stay alone. But it feels wrong to dwell too long on stuff that far in the past.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks. I miss those days too,&quot; I say. &quot;Call me again sometime before you head out here. We&apos;ll plan a day downtown in Denver.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Will do,&quot; he says. The line clicks. All that&apos;s left is the hum of the engine as I reach the bottom of the foothills, stuck in the space between songs when the vocals feather away.</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m stopped at a red light at a vacant crossroads. My left hand drums against the side of the car, keeping a beat without a song. It&apos;s always when I&apos;m the most still that I feel the flow of time, seconds ticking away with the rhythmic, harmonic shake of the engine. The discomfort of this stillness overtakes me as I sit here second after second without a single car passing, but the light is still green on the crossway. The crossroads is pitch black, and the feeling of emptiness rises my flesh with static like a sleeping limb.</p>
<p>&emsp;The feeling of itching stillness begins to return to me, that call of the void, and I feel it&apos;s presence as if it were sitting in the backseat, in the space where my friends used to be. I drop the pedal to the floor before the light can change, longing for that feeling of inertia to lull me back to peace: ripping through the intersection before the light can change.</p>

<p>&emsp;A Bankers Box is the last thing I have to store away in the small closet beneath the stairs. It&apos;s somehow lived to service my family through many moves, and the yellowed white of the cardboard is long-aged to prove it.  First is the word OFFICE in my mother&apos;s cursive from twenty-some years ago. That was scratched out to say COLLEGE STUFF in my father&apos;s handwriting five years ago. Four years later, for the long move back, I amended that with a semicolon, adding ENGINEERING TEXTBOOKS (AND SHIT) in my fine block script to help clarify. And now &mdash; so redacted it looks like a square Dalmatian &mdash; it reads CODY DUNSMORE, FIRST HOME.</p>
<p>&emsp;Inside is all the hobby stuff I used to like when I had the energy: a mess of soldering tips, beer-can capacitors and resistors as if I went back to the 90s and robbed a Radio Shack. There&apos;s a couple games I picked up when Mom drove me to GameStop for midnight releases with my buddies, and weighing it down is the signed lacrosse ball from the last Varsity game that let me letter in high school.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You know, for a new home owner, you sure have a lot of crap to start,&quot; my father says. &quot;Your mother and I started with nothing. Nothing!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it is a whole lot of nothing.&quot; I gesture to the lonely folding chair and cheap television in the small foyer. &quot;The modern man needs very little to be satisfied.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I just hope it&apos;s enough to survive,&quot; my mother says. She rubs her temples.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just glad it comes with a washer and dryer. Otherwise I&apos;d have to buy new clothes every week.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Dear Lord, Alan. Did we raise him?&quot; She turns to my father. &quot;Did he forget how to wash clothes some time in college?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He&apos;ll be fine, Kim,&quot; Dad says. </p>
<p>&emsp;It humors us when she gets the panicked look on her face. Neither of us can tell if it&apos;s a joke.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You remember? She&apos;s only washed my clothes since I got back from school. I think I remember how to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But you need to keep your shirts nice. For work,&quot; she says. &quot;You need to iron them. Did you get an ironing board?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I get it. I know, and I will, tomorrow,&quot; I tell her. &quot;You remember I&apos;ve been working there for two years, right? Everybody just wears jeans. Some even T-shirts.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Dad&apos;s face furrows at the thought. &quot;Dressing like that won&apos;t get you a promotion.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, they make fun of me when I dress up enough to tuck in my shirt. Saying I&apos;m trying to take their jobs.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, then . . .&quot; Dad starts, but his words trail off. </p>
<p>&emsp;The silence returns to us: it&apos;s a pivotal moment in our relationship. They were empty-nesters for four years, and right when they got used to it, they had me again for another two.  The childhood home will be so quiet: maybe it deafens them. I remember my mom kept the room and bed so neat every time I returned from college.</p>
<p>&emsp;Maybe there are phases to it, just like my late brother&apos;s room was all those years ago. It was as still as a museum for months. All his books and participation trophies were scattered thoughtfully as if he had just left the house to go see friends for a really, really long time, his letterman&apos;s jacket glistening with pins on the chair, and I almost thought they were planning on putting the whole room behind glass, until one windy day showed them it&apos;d be safer in seventeen boxes. </p>
<p>&emsp;Cardboard. </p>
<p>&emsp;Not like the polished wooden box beneath the ground, protecting all the things the illness couldn&apos;t take.</p>
<p>&emsp;They head towards the door and turn the knob, still chipper despite how it drags on all of us, and my father wants to show it the least. </p>
<p>&emsp;I almost think I can hear his voice crack. &quot;Just promise us you&apos;ll visit, right? Dinner next week?&quot; And to make it less emasculating, he adds, &quot;Your mother will go nuts if she can&apos;t do a load of laundry at least once a month.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I swear I&apos;ll never do it again,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I promise,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And maybe you can bring over a girl,&quot; Dad says. &quot;Don&apos;t get me wrong. You did great in school, but we&apos;re never gonna have grandchildren at this rate.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, Alan,&quot; Mom says. I think she&apos;s gonna shake her head or admonish him. </p>
<p>&emsp;But she surprises me. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re right. Wasn&apos;t there a reason Cody insisted on that queen-size bed?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And the spare bedroom. He&apos;s smart. Put a bed in there and he&apos;s got a fine doghouse.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. The gaming room, you mean?&quot; I ask, and they&apos;re half out the door before Dad answers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Lonely girls his age start collecting cats. I just pray you don&apos;t do that with games on that computer program you were showing me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I hold the smile though their words cut me, though they don&apos;t realize it. </p>
<p>&emsp;This isn&apos;t the way I wanted this memory to end.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe you can get that girl from work to come over. The older one you went to prom with. The asian one,&quot; Dad says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s enough,&quot; I tell him.</p>
<p>&emsp;I give my mother and father a hug. I squeeze my mother a little longer because she likes them, and I swear I can feel her tremble, just a little, and when they head for the car, my mother chokes on the last words before she&apos;ll probably lose it.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We love you, Cody. We&apos;re so proud of you,&quot; she says, loud enough that all my new neighbors can hear.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks. I love you too,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;I wave for a while as they depart, blasting the 80s love songs through their windows as my father ducks his head.</p>
<p>&emsp;I retreat through the threshold of the doorway, hesitating to close the door or else the suddenness of this new chapter might give me whiplash. A couple tears leave my eyes. I sniff. It&apos;s a bright March day, and somewhere beyond the spotless windows, the birds sing songs in staccato, coupled with the chattering rumble of new construction.</p>
<p>&emsp;I flick the lights on, then off, then on again, then settle for off. I sit at the head of the glass dining table to find myself in a familiar headspace, from all those years ago in college, when my roommates left to drive home to their families, and flying for me wasn&apos;t an option. In the small closet beneath the stairs is the Bankers Box, and somewhere inside my head I wonder how I can ever reignite those old passions.</p>
<p>&emsp;I sit there until tinnitus rings in my ears. I don&apos;t feel like gaming, going for a walk, or saying hello to the neighbors. I love my parents to pieces, but their words still cut me. I mean, I&apos;m twenty-six years old: is this the age where you start to really believe you&apos;ll be alone forever? </p>
<p>&emsp;The comebacks always come to you long after they&apos;re useful. I open the fridge my mom overstocked with frozen food from Costco in case I starve in the next three months and grab an off-brand seltzer, returning to darkness when the door closes. Then maybe he should have lived! He was smarter, handsomer, more alive than this flaw could ever give me, I could have said, but I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t. </p>
<p>&emsp;What do they think? Some neighbor girl is going to stumble in here looking for love?</p>
<p>&emsp;The thoughts get me nowhere, but the seltzer does. And when the clock reads 8:00 PM, three deep with the gold-painted cans standing like little league trophies on the finely-polished counter, I&apos;m finally able to forget. And I forget even easier when he stumbles through the open door.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Beer later, wey. Wanna hotbox my car?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He slicks his black hair back before dragging his feet on my mat, carrying a rack of cheap beer with an OfficeMax nametag pinned upside-down.</p>

<p>&emsp;The next lucid moment, I find myself pinned upside-down beneath a thick wooden rack. The heat climbs as I drag my heels across the floor, my clothes so black and charred that I pray my sweaty flesh might slick me back through the narrow space. Within the hot box of crackling logs and scalding cinders, the roar of recircling flames makes the house screech in agony when its bones crunch and crumble, casting twigs and thatch to the ashen floor.</p>
<p>&emsp;The twisting and thrashing gets me nowhere, but when a log column crashes into the thin floor, the rack slides into the hollow foundation. My body is so small and pathetic, but I&apos;m barely able to command my cramped muscles to escape, crawling across the floor as the smoke billows overhead, drawing shallow, stinging breaths into  my pinched lungs. </p>
<p>&emsp;The log walls close in like long fingers of a burning fist that clenches, casting glowing rubies of raging ruin that spread like a rash across the cabin&apos;s bones, and as I gasp harder for desperate breaths, losing the strength of air to drive my muscles, I realize that all the windows and doors are missing.</p>
<p>&emsp;The heat would evaporate my tears if I had the fluids left to cry. All that&apos;s left is to feel how much I loathe this feeling of helplessness. Didn&apos;t I escape this crumbling crypt of cinders? Or was the full life I led after just a dream of a dying mind, denying its demise? Didn&apos;t Stella and Erik and Bertram treat my burns as we sought solitude on the outskirts of Northaven? Or is this the last memory of my soul in the Reservoir, preparing to be reborn?</p>
<p>&emsp;But this body is so weak and useless, and I lust so strongly for power, for Essence: Essence that might let me bend steel; to bash through the walls; to crush the skulls of the arsonists. I only wish I could live to return the favor, to get revenge for that fading image of their faces.</p>
<p>&emsp;But I&apos;m just a child, and nobody came.</p>
<p>&emsp;The last segment of wall collapses, and I join my father and sisters,  entombed forever beneath the rubble. </p>
<p>&emsp;Or so I think, until I gasp for breath beneath the silken sheets of an unfamiliar bed.</p>

<p>&emsp;It takes a couple seconds before my mind is able to catch up on two decades of living history. It&apos;s not the first time my mind tormented me with visions of another life, one where the Gods of fortune hadn&apos;t intervened. My episodes were worse in the Barracks: so bad that they threw me in with all the other traumatized children of the war that tossed and turned too much in their sleep, waking the others with the foreshadowing shouts and screams of the slaughter that might await them.</p>
<p>&emsp;I always think I can be stronger. I always find myself thinking I can outmaneuver it, but it matters not how viciously I fight to comport myself. That poisonous malady of the soul is an everflowing source of suffering stronger than the sea. And even as I sit here with full recollection of everything that&apos;s brought me to this moment, I still can&apos;t shake that feeling of eternal freefall, that uncomfortable feathering in my stomach that casts my fingers and toes in phantom static, waiting and waiting for when I&apos;ll splatter against the end of this bottomless pit.</p>
<p>&emsp;But the end never comes. The only way, it seems, is to distract myself from the infinite fall, so that feeling becomes a lesser part of me. I&apos;ve tried hating it, but it never concedes. I&apos;ve tried overpowering it, but it&apos;s like sculpting water. So all I can do is follow the words of my father when these episodes would overtake me.</p>
<p>&emsp;Katiya, he would say. My beautiful daughter, you have to focus. Tell me, where are you right now?</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m in the town of Gaffesend, across the lake from where we used to live,&quot; I mutter, clutching my chest with numbing fingers that hinge against my will. My other hand reaches for the left side of the bed as I call out his name, longing for a touch beyond lust, but the bed is cold again: damp with his sweat from our passions the night before.</p>
<p>&emsp;Where are you?</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m in my new home. In the bedroom,&quot; I breathe. &quot;With plastered walls,&quot; I breathe. &quot;And a fan,&quot; I breathe, taking two breaths before the next distracting question comes to me I cast a look around as my eyes adjust from the dark of sleep to the brightness of morning.</p>
<p>&emsp;When are you?</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A near twenty years after I lost you.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s the hundred-and-twenty-ninth year after the Fall. A long winter fades into spring as the world opens again, and I can smell the buds of flowers blooming in the wild spaces. &quot;I&apos;ve come back to find something I lost, I think,&quot; I add.</p>
<p>&emsp;And can you describe how you feel?</p>
<p>&emsp;My breaths are slowing. My heart is acclimating to the stillness, and my body is accepting there&apos;s nothing that threatens it, even though I&apos;ve already identified all the exits. I must have flamed a little in my sleep: there are small burn holes where my naked body pressed hardest against the fabric. The sheets are saturated with soot from the scalding heat my circuits must have risen, but that&apos;s not what upsets me the most. As the world returns to me, I can feel my fists ball on a different kind of anger.</p>
<p>&emsp;I thought the passion of the night before might have compelled Jullian him to stay. The feeling of that truth feels so palpable when he kisses me, and for the hour after, my mind floats on the joy of all we&apos;ve shared: watching each other&apos;s siblings; studying those long nights together; even training in the early mornings; and all the time we&apos;d set aside for each other despite everything.</p>
<p>&emsp;Maybe it&apos;s the annoyed sigh he breathes when I goad him on the morning runs around the village, one of our traditions. Or maybe it&apos;s in the listless tick he acquired any time we walk about the village. Or maybe it&apos;s in his new group of friends &mdash; though he&apos;s always longed for a group to belong to, and I don&apos;t fault him for any of that.</p>
<p>&emsp;But he wasn&apos;t here when I needed him. The only considerate act was topping off the Essence switch with a touch, allowing the ceiling fan enough energy to run until I awoke. His clothes vanished as if he was trying to clear a crime scene.</p>
<p>&emsp;After I release myself from the tangle of bedsheets, I  poke my head out the back window facing west &mdash; nearly forgetting to cover my breasts with the thick red curtain as I try to guess the time. It&apos;s a commerce street,  and the stalls are vacant without produce or trinkets, the stools still tucked beneath the counters. The merchants tend to gather an hour after sunrise, meaning it&apos;s long before the time that we were told to gather outside the officer post.</p>
<p>&emsp;I glance out the east window that looks out upon a quaint little garden: my tiny lawn with a walkway that divides it, enclosed by the spires of a wrought-iron fence. The mountain air is so crisp and fresh as it pours though the windows, wrapping around the curtain that covers my extremities, and when I lift my eyes to the Purgatory Mountains, feeling the morning sun radiate my skin, I find a captivating view of Lake Gaffesend.</p>
<p>&emsp;The Gods of fortune haven&apos;t forgotten me, I think: but I refuse to ever lean on them with all my weight.</p>
<p>&emsp;I find the closet furnished to the measurements I gave at Orientation, though almost everything seems to be genderless. The underwear is the only thing that&apos;s distinctly feminine, and after smelling myself to ensure the stench of sweat is not severe, I slip on a pair, and proceed to dress in the Royal Guard&apos;s underclothes.</p>
<p>&emsp;The white undershirt is baggy, but not too long in the sleeves. I&apos;m just relieved to not have to wear the same binder I wore for graduation. After six hours listening to names, thinking I&apos;d pass out from the pain in my back and ribs, I wondered why they call it a &quot;breastplate&quot; when it&apos;s flatter than the Capital fields. </p>
<p>&emsp;But this is different armor: armor designed for show instead of function, for making the villagers feel safe, though the thin steel couldn&apos;t stop two thrashings from a sword. The steel only covers the shoulders, arms, hands, and chest, exposing the undershirt at the midriff. And beyond the showy sabatons on my feet, embellished with gold trim like all the rest of the armor that was never meant to get so much as a scratch, there are thin tassets that couldn&apos;t protect my hip from so much as a fall.</p>
<p>&emsp;I relish the feeling of excitement to try it on: anything that tears me from the lingering feeling in my stomach, and when I step into the washroom to look into the mirror, I imagine its guise before I even put it on.</p>
<p>&emsp;The person that looks back at me is carved as intentionally as the thousand sculptures my father whittled in the forest across the lake, carving the trimmings and stumps from his work as a carpenter. The only difference is in our intentions. His comes from that sedentary softness of imaginary inner peace, the very reason my parents settled in that village all those years ago. His showed in the soft shavings that split from the virgin bark, falling to the floor like petals as he perfected its form. But my intention lies in the real world, of flesh and blood. It lies in the continuous honing of my body to be ready for the fight that&apos;s coming &mdash; the approaching end to the long fall that forever turns my stomach &mdash; and I&apos;ll need every bit of strength I can gather to act as a breakwall, so that ruinous poison never spills over upon the innocents.</p>
<p>&emsp;I trace the definition in my abs, noticing all the imperfections I have yet to carve through training, trying to stop that self-immolating voice that says I will never be strong enough; that if not for Jullian, no one else would ever be attracted to someone like me. But this life has only ever been a sacrifice, since it should have been taken. I can&apos;t change my modest height, but I&apos;ve shaped just about everything else, and when I put on the undershirt, it covers all the weakness I have yet to improve.</p>
<p>&emsp;And now it&apos;s time to hone myself further.</p>

<p>&emsp;I descend the stairs in bare feet, carrying the thin cosmetic armor. The kitchen counters are vacant beyond some basic decorations: a bowl and a candle on every surface, what I&apos;ve learned is the bare minimum for any military-issued living space. Part of me hopes for an explanatory note from Jullian, but I find nothing, just my bag of possessions scattered across the floor.</p>
<p>&emsp;My stomach rumbles when my nose notices the commerce street is open. I spark the burners with Essence, throwing on some standard-issue porridge rations as I try to put on my second layer of clothing.</p>
<p>&emsp;A knock sounds on the door, rapping so hard that I should hear it anywhere in the house. It startles me when I&apos;m putting on the solid armor that refuses to give as I contort my body. It&apos;s an unfamiliar voice, but incredibly deep and charming.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Miss Katiya, darling, it&apos;s time to wake up,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Coming.&quot; I try to dress faster while blinded, but forget I&apos;m standing in front of my bag of personal items.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No need. I&apos;m a knocker commissioned by the Guard.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My foot catches before I can respond. I crash to the ground with a high squeak, my arms bound by an arm hole.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Miss Katiya . . . are you alright in there?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m certainly not right inside the armor.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m fine,&quot; I say, my head half-protruding from the head hole like a bashful turtle. My arms are all twisted inside the uncompromising metal. &quot;Thanks for the warning.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not a problem, love,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>&emsp;As I struggle to free myself from my metal cocoon, I recognize that there&apos;s a hinged strap on the side: something that would have made the struggle a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>&emsp;But then a sizzling sound sets off behind me. I&apos;m so charged with Essence that I must&apos;ve transferred too much to the burner. The porridge bubbles over the edges of the pot, edging off the wooden spoon that bridged the center. Scrambling from the floor, I reach my hand to withdraw heat from the stove, feeling that transfer of energy return to my circuits.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods damn it,&quot; I tell myself. And when I reach to grasp the handle of the pot, my foot slips in a mess of oats on the floor, casting a plume of molten chunks across the floorboards and the cabinetry.</p>
<p>&emsp;A voice rises from the other side of the house: a different pitch with the same sentiment.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;You alright in there, Aleena?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Aleena? Who&apos;s Aleena?</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, just a little accident,&quot; I say. &quot;Looks like I&apos;ll be skipping breakfast.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You can&apos;t miss breakfast if you&apos;re defending the village,&quot; he says. &quot;Come to the window.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;One second,&quot; I say, before throwing my armor on the right way, finding  buckles and straps that are stitched there for a reason. When I&apos;m sufficiently sharp, clothed in bright crimson and silver that&apos;s trimmed with gold, I reach for the window sill to drag it open.</p>
<p>&emsp;A stocky, bald man squats on one of the stools in the shadow of the building, his collection of fresh breads proudly displayed across the front of the booth.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re not Aleena. Your voice sounds like hers, though. Are you a friend?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;This is my new house,&quot; I tell him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. Sorry,&quot; he says. &quot;Well, you&apos;re certainly prettier than she was!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;A hand slaps him across the cheek. I bend down to see where it came from, and it&apos;s his wife, unloading the rest of their produce: they must have just arrived.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m Derry. And this is my wife, Carmen. We sell fresh bread here every morning.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;I shake their hands, bending awkwardly to meet their eyes from four feet off of street level.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The last girl preferred waking to the smell of fresh bread,&quot; Carmen says. &quot;She regaled us with tales of her travels in exchange for a loaf. Maybe you can do the same?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My peckishness speaks first. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course. What do I owe you?&quot; I ask, drawing my fingers into my coin purse for a couple Kine.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The first one&apos;s free, because I think you&apos;ll make a great customer. It&apos;s fresh, with a special blend of spices in there,&quot; he insists.</p>
<p>&emsp;His wife turns from unloading the cart. &quot;Say, what happened to the other girl?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp; I withdraw the key from my pocket: without the cover of night or blurred vision, I can inspect it a lot easier. The surface is rough where her name was ground away. I can see the shape of her letters interspersed between mine. It&apos;s been sanded enough that I&apos;m sure she&apos;s not the first: it&apos;s evident that the names of cadets were stacked and scratched nearly halfway through the metal shaft &mdash; at least twenty of them &mdash; and I doubt all those tenants left to move into a permanent home.</p>
<p>&emsp;The brief pang of fear surprises me, nearly overriding my hunger.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A shame she was drafted,&quot; Derry says, but his face lightens. &quot;But you seem lovely, too. Keep us entertained with stories of your little . . . quests, and we&apos;ll share a little,&quot; he insists.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I can do that,&quot; I manage: tempted, but too timid to ask how many faces they&apos;ve seen before.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s your name, dear?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya. Miss Katiya Breakey,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You have a wonderful day, Miss Katiya,&quot; he says, flashing a toothy smile before handing me a steaming breakfast bun.</p>
<p>&emsp;The hunger is more persuasive than the urge to clean the mess. I rush through the front door with the delicious bread dissolving between my teeth, and as I turn to set the lock, I catch the sight of a familiar face. </p>
<p>&emsp;Bertram struggles to bend down and tie his boot. I&apos;m not the only one that&apos;s not used to the armor.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s like the old village all over again,&quot; I shout.</p>
<p>&emsp;It startles him. He mulls over a response as I approach, struggling harder to tie a simple knot. &quot;Less fire, though. I hope it stays that way.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Speaking of disasters,&quot; I say, &quot;I don&apos;t mind watching you struggle for a while, but are you going to let me help you?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Bertram blushes, then nods. I stoop down to tame his laces, laughing at how stiffly he stands on the porch.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You know, you&apos;re supposed to tie them BEFORE you can&apos;t bend over,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I would surely remember if this nagging headache went away. I think I lost part of my mind last night. Say &mdash; where&apos;s double-L? Didn&apos;t you leave with him?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I did.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But he didn&apos;t stay,&quot; he replies.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I guess not,&quot; I tell him. </p>
<p>&emsp;He looks like he&apos;s about to add some commentary, but hinges his mouth shut before the insults can fly, settling instead for something else. &quot;Should we walk together?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That sounds great.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;And maybe every morning?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That sounds even better.&quot;</p>
