""Contacts. Described by a doctor.""
""And the ears? And the tail?"" Kei asks, getting Reed to tie the pirate corset behind her. ""How did you get those so perfect?""
I mouth the letters to her before Miguel makes it in my doorway.
""Eat...see. Eat-see,"" she says.
""Oh, Etsy?""
""Yeah, that,"" Rayna says, then remembers, ""but you can&apos;t touch them, because they&apos;re fragile!""..."
2,33,1,Chapter Thirty-Three,Modern Fantasy,Tournament glory and a stolen moment of closeness are shattered with sudden news from the north.,359,1275,"The first half of the morning goes on without much of a hitch. That was, until some toddler grabbed Rayna&apos;s tail before screaming KITTY! and launched her almost twice as high as a person should be able to jump. Then the child&apos;s mother told him ""not to grab things he doesn&apos;t know where they connect to"" &mdash; and since Rayna didn&apos;t get the connotation, I was lucky that I didn&apos;t have to explain it.
I spent most of my time explaining Dungeons & Dragons to Katiya, after sh..."

""Those other fighters were nothing,"" Rayna says, as the two of us circle in the center of the dirt arena. ""I&apos;ve got a taste for it again. I haven&apos;t fought like this since the Academy, and you&apos;re the only one that&apos;s put up a fight!""
""Then it&apos;s no wonder you&apos;re so rusty,"" I say, launching another jab at her as she leaps backward. It&apos;s hard not to use Essenc..."

We face in opposite directions with a sheet still separating us, and while I glance out the window to watch the metallic automobiles zip past beneath the miracle of electric light, I listen to Cody&apos;s uneven breathing.
And it&apos;s not even that he&apos;s snoring or gasping &mdash; but they&apos;re short and heavy and persistent, and for the longest time,..."

Someone steps forward, and the cost is real.",366,757,"When I rise from four hours of sleep, I find that same feeling of dread I found in college when the world finally caught up with me, when I remembered it was a heavy day of finals. But this was a test I couldn&apos;t study for.
I usually leave no later than 6:30, but I awoke around 5:00, finding the knight still sleeping next to me. But it was like waking from a restless night with a severe cold, because once my conscious mind became aware of the great discomfort, there wasn&apos;t a chance I w..."

Someone steps forward, and the cost is real.",366,1598,"When I arrive in the west-facing conference room, flanked by a phalanx of employees I&apos;ve never met before, I find the shutter shades drawn so tightly that the only glow in the room comes from their laptop screens. From the long chain of tables spanning most of the room, with three chairs on one side and seven on the other, I can tell the seating is assigned since there&apos;s only one spot left to fill.
Naveen sits in the left chair, and my father sits in the right, still refusing to turn ..."

Someone steps forward, and the cost is real.",366,551,"The men of the Dunsmore family are the best at taking bullets. And as the only one left whose number hasn&apos;t been called, I carry enough survivor&apos;s guilt for the three of us.
I was prepared to be vanished today. The private sector dodges a lot of the slow, bureaucratic cycle of government, and I was sure they&apos;d already drawn the documents for my termination, but they left themselves another option just in case. So after they got their pound of flesh through my father, I was no lon..."

It&apos;s an energy that races my circuits with the same signature of power but a different medium &mdash; like how human Essence can give rise to powers of both life and fire &mdash; and if Cody&apos;s faith in me lifted a sense of life, it&apos;s a fear for Bertram that blazes a fire.
The feeling carries me through the streets in a ru..."

I fight the blinding smoke for enough vision to lead Soot as my eyes water, breathing shallowly in the space behind Soot&apos;s neck that he drafts with air. While Soot toils with speed, my mind races over coming up with a plan: something, anything to turn Bertram around and get him back home safe. 
I race along the trail around the lake, the one I know from running every morning. For the longest time, I hear no..."

The cries of the victims are just as hushed as they were in the siege when the village is so sparsely spread between the pines, but there are still the diminishing sounds of combat.
I pass through a smoldered gate once carved by my father&apos;s hands. His handiwork lives on in all that&apos;s left of the intricate carvings: two burnt half-posts left from an arch that once had our village&apos;s name. 
But my hands don&apos;t t..."

It was checked by SAKURASHIMA, then approved by PRADESH, and now the chain of custody ends in my greasy hands, putting it all together.
The red toolbox won&apos;t be fooled by the hand-me-down fatigues that were just my size, because even if the woven tag reads DUNSMORE, and my likeness is spread across twelve Polaroid photos of my father and I &mdash; magnetized to the inner lid like a refrigerator door &mdash; I don&apos;t know w..."

My phone buzzes with messages and notifications from friends, all sending the same default message. But there&apos;s a message from the group chat with my parents: one that I&apos;ve still hesitated to open.
""They tried to call, but I couldn&apos;t bring myself to answer,"" I tell Kei and Reed. ""I feel like an asshole. But, birthday or not, I&apos;m just not ready to talk yet.""
They sit across from me in the booth, and we look like we come from t..."
2,36,3,Chapter Thirty-Six,Holding On,Kindness and rediscovery of an old passion dare Cody to care again.,380,1378,"The warmth from their kindness lasts until I get off the highway: it&apos;s not from the single drink I had, because I&apos;m fully sober. Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;ve been listening to music and audiobooks all day to make it through the grind, getting home so exhausted that I just pass out instead of letting all the life I haven&apos;t processed catch up with me. I haven&apos;t been clearing the rock from the hole I&apos;ve dig myself into, and at bedrock, I&apos;m afraid of going any fur..."

""Bravery is nothing without tact,"" Aldrin says, ""have the three of you learned nothing? You disobeyed direct orders!""
The shame forces my glance to never leave the bodies. I stand at the back window, watching twenty-some Senior Guards walk the landscape southeast in a perfect line. Several analyze the remains of my best friend: his face still frozen between rel..."

This time Soot carries two of us: my brother and I, as Jullian and Aryn ride behind on their own horses. The impalement is still there: medics cut the obsidian down with red-hot iron using the Essence blade I&apos;m no longer privileged to, filed it down, and wrapped it. Looking over Erik&apos;s shoulder, the haze has almost cleared enough to see home.
I hug Erik&apos;s waist, wondering how many times left I have to spend with him. The adrenaline fades away ..."

I sit on the toilet seat in the spare bathroom as a turbulent stream of water turns laminar when I draw back the faucet.
I rushed home to make the slides on the computer: down to two slides that pose the problem and the solution. I worked on the prototype and sped through it for three solid hours, making a model for my 3D printer to run as I wrote all the code in C++ for fast execution and idyllic control system latency for either the p..."

Ever since some mountain in Blackwater blew its top, a steady stream of human refugees flows through Gaffesend, headed south to the capital to start again.
I&apos;ve met with my friends during the last couple days, no more than a civilian in this town that rejects me. Ryder insists that this event is what he&apos;s been waiting for, taking up an oar for every ferry ride from dawn to dusk to ask if anyone knows a Romin or ..."

But I feel something different now as I sit in the foyer of a home I can barely afford, watching the first snow of the year lightly fall beyond the glass of my front window, sitting in a folding chair as I consider everything that brought me to this exact moment.
While my mind deliberates over whether I was actually going to kill myself &mdash; or just being pathetic..."

The trauma from my past has made me so combustible. 
""All it ever feels like is I was made to burn,"" I say, feeling all those memories race my body with Essence, and if I don&apos;t slow my breathing, the life will leave my extremities. ""I can&apos;t be calm &mdash; like Aryn, or you, and I just don&apos;t get it!""

She leans against my shoulder, drooling on my shirt, her hair still disheveled with grass and leaves between the strands, and after I gently lower her to the thin cushions of the IKEA couch &mdash; wrapping her in a tasseled throw blanket called VINTERFINT &mdash; there&apos;s an unsettling energy that rises in my nerves.
