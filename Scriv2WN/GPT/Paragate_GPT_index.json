            "In the long, dragging years after college, all I could ever ask is to waste my life as efficiently as possible. ",
            "It's like how I'm told falling in love is supposed to be: I can't pinpoint when the feeling began, only the realization that I was stuck in it, wading through a long, dark tunnel in the passageways of my mind, praying that the distant light approaching wasn't that of another train. Maybe it was the twenty-sixth hour awake at two o'clock in the library, on that Sunday before finals, when a study partner scrolling Facebook reminded me that it was my birthday. Maybe it was turning down Kei when she asked me to go out to celebrate my twenty-first, preferring the cold basement of the fraternity house when I knew everybody else would be away. Maybe it was that I felt more satisfied shelving the senior project I named after my late brother than all the accolades and attention that came after it.",
            "Maybe it was the speech my father gave at my graduation party, splurging on his male allowance of tears, saying how excited he was to work alongside me at the aerospace company. How I didn't laugh when he said my engineering drawings would have to be worthy of his tools. And how I realized I felt absolutely nothing.",
            "But it's been two-and-a-half years since I returned to my hometown in Colorado. I reached the summit of my Bachelors' degree with too much exhaustion to take in the view, and in the two-year descent on expired passions that once got me to the top, I can't think of anything exceptional that's happened since.",
            "Not counting today, that is.",
            "The thought comes to me a lot in periods of idle silence. As I sit in my new townhome, celebrating the wake of another great milestone, all I hear is the white noise of my best friend snoring in sudden stops and starts on my futon, using one of the broken cardboard moving boxes as a bedsheet, rattling the mess of empty beer cans as he fights a losing battle for comfort.",
            "It takes a moment to lift myself from the flimsy folding chair. I fight the spinning world, stumbling towards the kitchen counter to grab the remote. Freaky Friday autoplays on some free streaming service since I was too lazy to enter the family account. I reach to turn off the wall TV that's angled on the floor, but I hesitate — finding that I enjoy the faint sound of it over the silence.",
            "I smile. It feels nice to have my friend here, I think.",
            "The tears still wet my face, mostly from the laughter of digging up past memories, and reconnecting with a cherished childhood friend. I lift my old lacrosse stick from the ground to use it as a cane, digging my fingers into the mesh of the basket, deciding to fetch a glass of water to mitigate tomorrow's long hangover headache. But then an odd chill convects the wetness of my skin. ",
            "I hear my parents' lecture from an hour earlier — a long diatribe on how much I wasted their heating bill by keeping my windows cracked in the winter, trying to resist my mother's menopausal \"cold flashes\". But this is my budget now, and unwilling to suffer beyond the thin sliver of disposable income after my mortgage, I hobble towards the wall, nearly in-step with Miguel's loud snore, trying to dodge the crumpled cans. ",
            "I press my hand to the window screen. The window is open, but the breeze funnels out instead of in. And when I close the window, I feel my ears pop from the rising pressure. ",
            "I remember my first thermo class: isn't hot supposed to run to cold?",
            "So I search for the source, thinking I found my first item for the punch list. The air is dry, and when I stumble towards the source of the gusting winds — the small closet beneath the stairs — a faint, flickering light glows in the space beneath the door.",
            "An empty can crunches when I step on it, and I realize I'm still wearing my steel-toed shoes, along with the rest of my casual work clothes. The lacrosse stick braces me as I stumble forwards—feeling like my uncle does on Ambien when he doesn't fall asleep in time—until my hand touches the freezing handle.",
            "Tumultuous winds scream beneath the door and through the cracks, bashing the fitting against the lock. My mind doesn't work well when it's crossed, but I find myself fixated on how strange the closet door looks. I never noticed the handle, etched with an intricacy so far outside the palate of the builders' package. ",
            "Surely Mom or Dad would have noticed it on any one of the tours, right?",
            "I turn the knob far enough that the bolt no longer withholds the gale, and I lose all my control. ",
            "The wooden door buffets me in the face. Stars flash in my vision, and if it weren't for the lacrosse stick, I would have slammed my head on the granite counter. Instead, I find myself slumped beneath the bartop, barricaded by two metal stools.",
            "I'm speechless until the rooms equalize in pressure, rubbing out the ache in my forehead. I lift my eyes. No longer does the closet greet me, but the light of a whole other townhouse on the opposing side.",
            "Unable to fathom whether this dream is just the imaginings of an inebriated mind, I lift myself from the floor and stumble through the threshold of the archway. The contours of the floor change from that of smooth, buffered wood to sanded planks and stone. On the other side is another thick wooden door with the same handle, thrown all the way open. I wonder if my neighbors are so old that they insist on the technology of the last century. Who would spend the money to furnish their townhome this way, with walls and decor so aged my great-grandmother would feel at home?",
            "It feels so wrong to be here, but I'm a social drunk, and this is a chance to make friends.",
            "\"Hello? You forgot to lock your door. Sorry to intrude — I'm the neighbor from the unit on the other side. My name is Cody, Cody Dunsmore,\" I say, and so I continue, stammering my words to ensure my presence isn't a surprise, though with cast iron kettles and candles, I doubt these fogies would be agile enough to swing anything at their friendly intruder.",
            "I find a knight's uniform on the table, tailored to a woman's measurements, along with realistic metal boots.",
            "\"The old bat must be into costume play. Whatever gets you off,\" I mutter, but then I see the biggest surprise leaning against the wall. I try to take it in my hands, but it's so damn heavy: nothing like the weapons those mall ninjas buy at conventions.",
            "I drop the lacrosse stick to try to lift it. Surely it's one of those real-looking swords the neckbeards buy, right?",
            "Nope.",
            "\"Christ almighty!\" I exclaim.",
            "I try to steady it the same way I saw in the movies, but it kills my wrists. I wonder how many exercises these geriatric fantasy fetishists have to do to hold a sword like this, like holding a barbell by its end.",
            "I put it back against the wall, and I decide to try speaking again. ",
            "\"Hello? You left your door open.\" ",
            "The house smells too musty to be a new build, like it's seen generations of families through its halls. Spiderwebs collect in the corners of the cabinets. The crimson curtains are bleached from decades of continuous sunlight. And when I fumble for a light switch on the walls, I find nothing: nor a single cord in this simple home snaked across the surface.",
            "The space is dead silent in the absence of appliances: so silent that I can hear the heartbeat in my ears. Maybe I should return home to try again tomorrow. ",
            "But my plan is cut short when a shadow slides behind the front marbled glass. I haven't the time to react when the door blasts open, screeching on rusted hinges. The intruder closes the distance before I have a chance to react, blasting their glowing palm against my shoulder, casting me over their dining table with a whole handprint burned into my beer-stained work shirt.",
            "The female knight is quick to pin me against the floor, straddling me with her bare thighs. My mind races to explain. I can only consider she's an influencer, or one of those intensely dedicated cosplayers I found LARPing on campus. Her speech is incoherent — but the longer she berates me in her mother language, drawing the prop knife against my neck as I struggle under her inhuman strength, a strange comprehension of her words overtakes me.",
            "I feel the sentiment behind her panic. I thought she was just speaking in tongues, but I can feel my mind strain as it arranges itself to piece together the meaning of the words. And when the headache passes, I realize that I can understand her fully.",
            "Her eyes are a golden hazel from colored contacts, and I see both of them when she looks down at me, although she covers her convincingly-scarred right eye with bangs. ",
            "She's dressed like one of those hobbyists at the Shaleborough Renaissance Faire. Her blond, silken braid hangs forward from her shoulder as she leans over me, making her look more like an angry princess than a defensive knight.",
            "\"Chill out,\" I say, slurring my words. \"I'm your neighbor!\"",
            "But I find the panic in her face to be even greater than mine. She rocks on my torso with every shallow breath, expertly resisting every ounce of strength I have to fight, and I feel the coolness of her cosplay armor chill the heat of my flesh as she pins my arms with her gauntlets. ",
            "\"You aren't going anywhere,\" she tells me, tightening her grasp on my wrists. Her warm breath is on my neck as she tries to steady the prop knife, and she almost seems intimidated by my drunken composure. But it's the sudden rise in emotion that ignites something I'm even more afraid of — and I try to make it known to her. ",
            "\"I think you should get off me, I—I can't control it,\" I say, but she's clueless about what she does to me, straddling my waist with her strong, bare thighs, the pulse of my heart quickly transitioning to my waist.",
            "\"You control nothing, thief!\"",
            "My arms are pinned beneath her legs. The pressure pounds in my skull. There's no chance to try the waistband trick, and there's only one place that all the blood can go.",
            "\"You're a fool to break into the military district. I'm a knight of the Royal Guard,\" she declares, as the edge of the prop knife digs into my neck. ",
            "\"I don't think you understand. I can't control what's going to happen,\" I say, squirming with all I have.",
            "\"You pathetic weakling, what could you possibly do now?\" ",
            "She has the upper hand. And all I have is a single word I learned on the Internet.",
            "\"S-S-Scaroused.\"",
            "\"Scaroused?\" The language might be lost, but she certainly pieces together their meaning moments later."

            "Her face flushes in mere seconds. I struggle beneath her as she tensions the knife against my neck, and when I feel the edge scratch the stubble beneath my chin, the cold steel drawing the heat from my neck, I realize it's real enough to draw something else.",
            "\"You degenerate! You lecherous, filthy animal, breaking in my house to . . . to—\"",
            "She quickly retreats, her piercing, yellow eyes assessing me with stronger eye contact than I had at my first job interview.",
            "I lack the mental capacity to decide whether to laugh or scream. \"I swear, I didn't break in here,\" I say, still embarassed as I cover my erection with my hands, hoping her e-girl stardom has dumbed her down enough to lack object permanence. I gesture to the closet. \"The door was open. I just walked in.\"",
            "She points the knife at me, then gestures to the closet. \"The door was locked, you fool. And the closet? How would you break through a damn closet? There's no windows in there.\"",
            "\"I know, but please! I'm as confused as you are,\" I say, taking a breath as I try to abate the dizziness I feel from changing positions so fast. \"Give me a chance to explain.\"",
            "\"You're excited, not confused!\" She points the dagger between my legs. \"You don't have the right to be confused right now.\" She rambles on like I actually came in to assault her. With the mental capacity for only one emotion, I settle for anger, furious about the hand I've been dealt in moving next to this crazy bitch.",
            "She says, \"I'm the one that's confused at how—\"",
            "\"—Would you let me explain? Dear God!\" I say.",
            "\"It's Gods, you heretic,\" she says. And she looks so legitimately angry that I'm unsure whether she's spent too much time online to live in the real world. \"Respect the other races. We're not the only one that shares Fosroth, and all our Gods have proven their presence.\"",
            "\"God, I said,\" I say. \"A real god. Not the ones you cosplay freaks pretend to worship.\"",
            "\"Do you want to be executed for apostasy? Because I can do that for you, right now.\" Her hollow words mean little when I'm more focused on the closet. Maybe one of my eyes still wanders over her toned body and the musculature of her core — or maybe it's just because I'm so crossed on Miguel's mini-Mason-Jar mass of Mary Jane that my eyes are still crossing, too.",
            "But she notices where I'm retreating, and in an instant, she sidesteps towards the door, using the knife to goad me away from freedom.",
            "\"Listen. What I want is to go home: not to get stabbed by a letter opener. I'm your neighbor, and the door between our units was open,\" I say. \"I was simply trying to tell you. But really — did you have to tackle me to get your point across?\"",
            "\"You do not live here. This is the Military District. Besides — you've proved that you are far too weak to live here,\" she says, and whether she's sold on her delsuions or not, I've still settled on anger.",

            "\"I'm sorry to intrude. Look. I know you might be into cosplay or whatever, but this is taking things too far.\" I rack my mind on all the anime and movies I've seen with characters like her. Maybe if I notice, it would calm her down.",
            "\"Cosplay?\" She asks, as if she doesn't know the word.",
            "\"Costume play,\" I say, glaring with as much disbelief as I can manage: this bitch acts like an Eskimo that's never seen ice before. \"At first I thought it was old people living here: the kettle, the candles . . . I mean, the whole damn house is set up like Skyrim.\" I try to find a single power outlet, wondering if she footed the bill with her e-girl dollars to strip them all out of a new unit. And as I wonder how she streams on a computer, debating whether it's a desktop or a laptop, a new anger sets her over the edge.",

            "\"No, of course not,\" I say, then clarify, \"no, not not legitimate. Legit, I mean. You're very convincing. It's amazing. Steel letter opener? Form-fit foam from the craft store for the interlays, along with actual metal for some of your armor?\" I ramble further on details, trying to buy myself time, but she's still hung on something I said. \"I'm sure you have loads of followers like my cousin does.

Because the rest of us have to work real jobs, not getting paid by thirsty horndogs that jerk off to Shakespeare!\"",

I tear the sleeve off my muddy, bloodstained shirt so I can try to wrap it up, all while I try to remember the content of my middle school health class. It's the first time I'm able to look around and take in my surroundings. The sky is overcast and pitch-dark, with none of Denver's light pollution obscuring the stars. A great body of water spans before me, which is puzzling: if I left the adjoining unit from the front, shouldn't Emerald Lake be a couple blocks away?",

The only thought on my inebriated mind are the words of my late father. And even if his last words were delivered as a whisper, they're far louder than the raucous trainees crowding Gaffe's End Tavern. ",
            "He said that I would never find peace in shouldering the weight of all the world. He said it wasn't because I was weak, or that I was naive — or that I wasn't aware of all the reasons we had to be afraid. He said it was because those feelings were wasting my life. ",
            "And then he died the next day in his sleep: burned alive with his youngest progeny that lacked the strength to fight back.",
            "My father made the same mistake that all the other villagers make, thinking that suffering is only caused by change. They think the discomfort in their everyday lives is just an affect of higher forces — whether by the whims of the Gods or the everlasting hunger of our war. They assume the rare breadths of stillness are caused by a break in the action: that war and its wreckage are just the affects of an empire's ambition; that all the fighting is only driven by greed.",

            "I hate drinking because it always makes me feel like I'm too weak to face reality. Before long, I realize I'm not watching the exits — and the more I keep pace with my male comrades, the more I find some stupid hope that this dizziness might shake my own feelings loose. I swirl the crimson ale around in the wooden mug to free the bubbles, envying how easily they float to the surface. ",
            "An hour passes since the close of labour. The cobblestone streets bustle with villagers returning home from a long day's work. There are four of us that watch from the window, entranced by the balance of energy between two worlds. Now is that rare hour when the drunken stupor of the pub's regulars matches the stumble of the tiresome commoners. The sun has already vanished below the mountains, but its colorful influence reflects across the lake.",
            "I get the spins as my childhood friend Bertram talks to Ryder and Naya, two shy recruits that would sit alone if we weren't all friends. None of us would be here if they weren't dangling the keys to our new homes at the end of it, forcing us all to weather the best and worst of our graduating class. Somewhere behind us, the others laugh and cheer. They've convinced themselves that this transition is a triumphant victory, too shortsighted to see that life in Gaffesend rides on the results of an enervating final test. ",
            "And here it comes.",
            "There's no more simulations, practice runs, or drills. Failure is a one-way ticket to the front lines, and I will never get another chance.",
            "I take another sip, coaxing that feeling of joy to wash over me. I can tell that Bertram thinks the same thoughts when his eyes rest on the village on the other side of the lake. He nudges my right arm before opening his mouth to speak, gesturing to the twelve other trainees behind him.",
            "\"To them it's just a random assignment, no more than the toss of a coin. But to you and I, and maybe Ryder, this is divine. This is the will of the Gods, Katiya. This is the first sentence in our declaration of war.\"",
            "I tell him it is, and with my next swallow of ale, I prove it.",
            "The details are hazy. My mind protects me by forgetting everything I witnessed as a young child, and the harder I push to excise them, the deeper they dig. All I have left is the memory of Bertram pulling me from the smoldering cabin, dragging me to my mother Stella so that our fractured families could escape to the south.",
            "\"For years I was so angry,\" I tell him. \"If I could have joined the forces then, I would have put off all the schooling. I would have gone straight to the front lines to find justice for what they did to us.\"",
            "\"So why didn't you?\" He asks with a smirk.",
            "I shrug. \"How could all Chymaerans be evil if there are people like Pax that have their blood?\"",
            "I gesture to the half-blooded halfwit behind us. Paxton uses his Chymaeran Essence to try to freeze the watered-down liquor, enough to stack a seventh shot glass as the others cheer him on, drawing the attention of all the other patrons. Even Ryder puts his book down for a second to watch, letting out a small chuckle as it wavers.",
            "\"You have honor and a kind heart, and it's what I like about you. What I always have,\" Bertram says. He leans close enough that I can feel his firm shoulder press against mine. \"But keep enough of that anger. If we don't make the program — or if the enemy breaks the lines and crosses the lake in the winter — that fury is the only thing that's going to keep us alive.\"",
            "\"Rest assured it runs in my circuits with the Essence,\" I tell him. \"The long winter ends with our probation. It's spring now, and we have a—\"",
            "My words cut short when the tower crashes on the eighth glass. Pax presses his face to the table's surface, sucking up whatever he can of the liquor and the attention. ",
            "But I still find that I'm unable to escape the gravity of that feeling — that dragging desire that's followed me since the beginning. The desire to have that one moment that validates all of it, that makes it all worth something. And I pray to the Gods that longing is stronger than the fear of what lies ahead. "

There is not a set number: you have already proved your excellence in the Capital. And if you keep that excellence, you will join us.

            "The next lucid moment, I find myself pinned upside-down beneath a thick wooden rack. The heat climbs as I drag my heels across the floor, my clothes so black and charred that I pray my sweaty flesh might slick me back through the narrow space. Within the hot box of crackling logs and scalding cinders, the roar of recircling flames makes the house screech in agony when its bones crunch and crumble, casting twigs and thatch to the ashen floor.",
            "The twisting and thrashing gets me nowhere, but when a log column crashes into the thin floor, the rack slides into the hollow foundation. My body is so small and pathetic, but I'm barely able to command my cramped muscles to escape, crawling across the floor as the smoke billows overhead, drawing shallow, stinging breaths into  my pinched lungs. ",
            "The log walls close in like long fingers of a burning fist that clenches, casting glowing rubies of raging ruin that spread like a rash across the cabin's bones, and as I gasp harder for desperate breaths, losing the strength of air to drive my muscles, I realize that all the windows and doors are missing.",
            "The heat would evaporate my tears if I had the fluids left to cry. All that's left is to feel how much I loathe this feeling of helplessness. Didn't I escape this crumbling crypt of cinders? Or was the full life I led after just a dream of a dying mind, denying its demise? Didn't Stella and Erik and Bertram treat my burns as we sought solitude on the outskirts of Northaven? Or is this the last memory of my soul in the Reservoir, preparing to be reborn?",
            "But this body is so weak and useless, and I lust so strongly for power, for Essence: Essence that might let me bend steel; to bash through the walls; to crush the skulls of the arsonists. I only wish I could live to return the favor, to get revenge for that fading image of their faces.",
            "But I'm just a child, and nobody came.",
            "The last segment of wall collapses, and I join my father and sisters,  entombed forever beneath the rubble. ",

            "It takes a couple seconds before my mind is able to catch up on two decades of living history. It's not the first time my mind tormented me with visions of another life, one where the Gods of fortune hadn't intervened. My episodes were worse in the Barracks: so bad that they threw me in with all the other traumatized children of the war that tossed and turned too much in their sleep, waking the others with the foreshadowing shouts and screams of the slaughter that might await them.",
            "I always think I can be stronger. I always find myself thinking I can outmaneuver it, but it matters not how viciously I fight to comport myself. That poisonous malady of the soul is an everflowing source of suffering stronger than the sea. And even as I sit here with full recollection of everything that's brought me to this moment, I still can't shake that feeling of eternal freefall, that uncomfortable feathering in my stomach that casts my fingers and toes in phantom static, waiting and waiting for when I'll splatter against the end of this bottomless pit.",
            "But the end never comes. The only way, it seems, is to distract myself from the infinite fall, so that feeling becomes a lesser part of me. I've tried hating it, but it never concedes. I've tried overpowering it, but it's like sculpting water. So all I can do is follow the words of my father when these episodes would overtake me.",
            "Katiya, he would say. My beautiful daughter, you have to focus. Tell me, where are you right now?",
            "\"I'm in the town of Gaffesend, across the lake from where we used to live,\" I mutter, clutching my chest with numbing fingers that hinge against my will. My other hand reaches for the left side of the bed as I call out his name, longing for a touch beyond lust, but the bed is cold again: damp with his sweat from our passions the night before.",
            "Where are you?",
            "\"I'm in my new home. In the bedroom,\" I breathe. \"With plastered walls,\" I breathe. \"And a fan,\" I breathe, taking two breaths before the next distracting question comes to me I cast a look around as my eyes adjust from the dark of sleep to the brightness of morning.",
            "When are you?",
            "\"A near twenty years after I lost you.\" ",
            "It's the hundred-and-twenty-ninth year after the Fall. A long winter fades into spring as the world opens again, and I can smell the buds of flowers blooming in the wild spaces. \"I've come back to find something I lost, I think,\" I add.",
            "And can you describe how you feel?",
            "My breaths are slowing. My heart is acclimating to the stillness, and my body is accepting there's nothing that threatens it, even though I've already identified all the exits. I must have flamed a little in my sleep: there are small burn holes where my naked body pressed hardest against the fabric. The sheets are saturated with soot from the scalding heat my circuits must have risen, but that's not what upsets me the most. As the world returns to me, I can feel my fists ball on a different kind of anger.",
            "I thought the passion of the night before might have compelled Jullian him to stay. The feeling of that truth feels so palpable when he kisses me, and for the hour after, my mind floats on the joy of all we've shared: watching each other's siblings; studying those long nights together; even training in the early mornings; and all the time we'd set aside for each other despite everything.",
            "Maybe it's the annoyed sigh he breathes when I goad him on the morning runs around the village, one of our traditions. Or maybe it's in the listless tick he acquired any time we walk about the village. Or maybe it's in his new group of friends — though he's always longed for a group to belong to, and I don't fault him for any of that.",
            "But he wasn't here when I needed him. The only considerate act was topping off the Essence switch with a touch, allowing the ceiling fan enough energy to run until I awoke. His clothes vanished as if he was trying to clear a crime scene.",
            "After I release myself from the tangle of bedsheets, I  poke my head out the back window facing west — nearly forgetting to cover my breasts with the thick red curtain as I try to guess the time. It's a commerce street,  and the stalls are vacant without produce or trinkets, the stools still tucked beneath the counters. The merchants tend to gather an hour after sunrise, meaning it's long before the time that we were told to gather outside the officer post.",
            "I glance out the east window that looks out upon a quaint little garden: my tiny lawn with a walkway that divides it, enclosed by the spires of a wrought-iron fence. The mountain air is so crisp and fresh as it pours though the windows, wrapping around the curtain that covers my extremities, and when I lift my eyes to the Purgatory Mountains, feeling the morning sun radiate my skin, I find a captivating view of Lake Gaffesend.",
            "The Gods of fortune haven't forgotten me, I think: but I refuse to ever lean on them with all my weight.",
            "I find the closet furnished to the measurements I gave at Orientation, though almost everything seems to be genderless. The underwear is the only thing that's distinctly feminine, and after smelling myself to ensure the stench of sweat is not severe, I slip on a pair, and proceed to dress in the Royal Guard's underclothes.",
            "The white undershirt is baggy, but not too long in the sleeves. I'm just relieved to not have to wear the same binder I wore for graduation. After six hours listening to names, thinking I'd pass out from the pain in my back and ribs, I wondered why they call it a \"breastplate\" when it's flatter than the Capital fields. ",
            "But this is different armor: armor designed for show instead of function, for making the villagers feel safe, though the thin steel couldn't stop two thrashings from a sword. The steel only covers the shoulders, arms, hands, and chest, exposing the undershirt at the midriff. And beyond the showy sabatons on my feet, embellished with gold trim like all the rest of the armor that was never meant to get so much as a scratch, there are thin tassets that couldn't protect my hip from so much as a fall.",
            "I relish the feeling of excitement to try it on: anything that tears me from the lingering feeling in my stomach, and when I step into the washroom to look into the mirror, I imagine its guise before I even put it on.",
            "The person that looks back at me is carved as intentionally as the thousand sculptures my father whittled in the forest across the lake, carving the trimmings and stumps from his work as a carpenter. The only difference is in our intentions. His comes from that sedentary softness of imaginary inner peace, the very reason my parents settled in that village all those years ago. His showed in the soft shavings that split from the virgin bark, falling to the floor like petals as he perfected its form. But my intention lies in the real world, of flesh and blood. It lies in the continuous honing of my body to be ready for the fight that's coming — the approaching end to the long fall that forever turns my stomach — and I'll need every bit of strength I can gather to act as a breakwall, so that ruinous poison never spills over upon the innocents.",
            "I trace the definition in my abs, noticing all the imperfections I have yet to carve through training, trying to stop that self-immolating voice that says I will never be strong enough; that if not for Jullian, no one else would ever be attracted to someone like me. But this life has only ever been a sacrifice, since it should have been taken. I can't change my modest height, but I've shaped just about everything else, and when I put on the undershirt, it covers all the weakness I have yet to improve.",
            "And now it's time to hone myself further."

            "I descend the stairs in bare feet, carrying the thin cosmetic armor. The kitchen counters are vacant beyond some basic decorations: a bowl and a candle on every surface, what I've learned is the bare minimum for any military-issued living space. Part of me hopes for an explanatory note from Jullian, but I find nothing, just my bag of possessions scattered across the floor.",
            "My stomach rumbles when my nose notices the commerce street is open. I spark the burners with Essence, throwing on some standard-issue porridge rations as I try to put on my second layer of clothing.",
            "A knock sounds on the door, rapping so hard that I should hear it anywhere in the house. It startles me when I'm putting on the solid armor that refuses to give as I contort my body. It's an unfamiliar voice, but incredibly deep and charming.",
            "\"Miss Katiya, darling, it's time to wake up,\" he says.",
            "\"Coming.\" I try to dress faster while blinded, but forget I'm standing in front of my bag of personal items.",

            "\"Not a problem, love,\" he says. ",
            "As I struggle to free myself from my metal cocoon, I recognize that there's a hinged strap on the side: something that would have made the struggle a whole lot easier.",
            "But then a sizzling sound sets off behind me. I'm so charged with Essence that I must've transferred too much to the burner. The porridge bubbles over the edges of the pot, edging off the wooden spoon that bridged the center. Scrambling from the floor, I reach my hand to withdraw heat from the stove, feeling that transfer of energy return to my circuits.",
            "\"Gods damn it,\" I tell myself. And when I reach to grasp the handle of the pot, my foot slips in a mess of oats on the floor, casting a plume of molten chunks across the floorboards and the cabinetry.",

            "\"Yeah, just a little accident,\" I say. \"Looks like I'll be skipping breakfast.\"",
            "\"You can't miss breakfast if you're defending the village,\" he says. \"Come to the window.\"",
            "\"One second,\" I say, before throwing my armor on the right way, finding  buckles and straps that are stitched there for a reason. When I'm sufficiently sharp, clothed in bright crimson and silver that's trimmed with gold, I reach for the window sill to drag it open.",

            "Someone slaps him across the face. I bend down to see where it came from, and it's his wife, unloading the rest of their produce: they must have just arrived.",
            "\"I'm Derry. And this is my wife, Carmen. We sell fresh bread here every morning.\" I shake their hands, bending awkwardly to meet their eyes from four feet off of street level.",
            "\"The last girl preferred waking to the smell of fresh bread,\" Carmen says. \"She regaled us with tales of her quests in exchange for a loaf. Maybe you can do the same?\"",
            "My peckishness speaks first. ",
            "\"Of course. What do I owe you?\" I ask, drawing my fingers into my coin purse for a couple Kine.",

            "His wife turns from unloading the cart. \"Say, what happened to the other girl?\"",
            " I withdraw the key from my pocket: without the cover of night or blurred vision, I can inspect it a lot easier. The surface is rough where her name was ground away. I can see the shape of her letters interspersed between mine. It's been sanded enough that I'm sure she's not the first: it's evident that the names of cadets were stacked and scratched nearly halfway through the metal shaft — at least twenty of them — and I doubt all those tenants left to move into a permanent home.",
            "The brief pang of fear surprises me, nearly overriding my hunger.",
            "\"A shame she was drafted,\" Derry says, but his face lightens. \"But you seem lovely, too. Keep us entertained with stories of your little . . . quests, and we'll share a little,\" he insists.",
            "\"I can do that,\" I manage: tempted, but too timid to ask how many faces they've seen before.",

            "With my best friend here, I can almost convince myself that it's all going to be alright, and I relish in the nostalgia of shared memories. The feeling carries all the way until we arrive at the posting board, ready to start on our first day."

            "\"No shit!\" He laughs. \"Puta madre, the yellow thirst was real for you, man.\" He cracks another can after getting mowed down by an LMG. \"Are you gonna shoot your shot? You told me you got some experience in college, right?\"",
            "\"Yeah. But I don't know...\" none of those nights in college really fulfilled me. I was always missing something. \"I'm not into the clubbing scene like you are.\"",

            "The feeling's all I've been able to think about since I got back here. No more regimentation. No convenient road map of class to class to graduation: now it's all just open-ended.",

            "\"Sure, man. But I don't have a cot or a sleeping bag or anything.\"",
            "\"Please. I've slept on floors my whole adult life!\" He gestures to the box with 23 stones left. \"Now are you gonna help me finish all of them?\"",
            "\"All of them?\"",
            "\"All of them,\" he says. \"It's Friday. I know we're old and shit now, but stay awake a little longer, like we're twelve and it's a sleepover in your parents' basement, and I'll tell you a bedtime story.\"",

            "I lift the can to my lips, but I don't let the poison pass the threshold. Past experience tells me that I'm toeing my limit: lost enough to let my stupid emotions leak on my face, to conjure words to try to push them down, but not enough to kneel at the porcelain throne. I know the feeling is real because the wetness on my face gives it credence, and I often think he's the only friend I've got left to listen.",

You always have the energy, but I don't know how you find it.\" The tears leak further: I can't remember the last time I was drunk enough to let them out. \"But I know the time is in between there somewhere, I mean, I'm certain I could fit in anything if I tried. But I'm always just so damn tired.\"",

            "\"Yeah, you think this is just a bit?\"",
            "\"No, of course not.\" He sets his phone on a cardboard box and thinks for a moment. \"Why I 'feel it.' I don't know . . . I guess I just got a big family that always keeps me busy. My cousins are young, and my siblings are still in college, so I end up going to their parties and stuff.\"",
            "\"So it's like college never ended for you. Never realized I'd miss it so much . . . my roommates made the damn experience,\" I say. It didn't matter if we were in the dorms or slumming it in an expensive renter-fixer-upper west of campus: those fuckers forced me to get out. \"Most nights, when I was studying in my bedroom, nose stuck in a textbook, they'd pick the lock and barge in — shooting me with flaming Nerf darts, assaulting me with a pizza cutter, or dragging me to one of their parties.\"",

            "\"Of course. Our families had a lot of fun together: barbeques, parties at the park...\" The list trails off when he crunches the can in his hands.",
            "\"You remember those weekends in middle school when we tried to beat the Halo campaign in a single night?\"",
            "\"Yeah. And your brother would buy all those energy drinks, sneaking them downstairs for us,\" he says. \"Oh, and the summer tent sleepovers, remember that one night you were so scared of the lightning you couldn't move, and my dad had to carry you back inside?\"",
            "\"I was stuck in the sleeping bag, so soaking wet from the rain I almost slid out of his arms,\" I say. We share a laugh. \"Or the RV trip we took for the out-of-state Lacrosse game—when we got stuck on the side of the road. We used up all the power playing GameCube and my dad was furious!\"",
            "He laughs. \"Yeah. And we had to ask one of the families running behind to pick us up. The whole time we waited there, your dad was screaming at Triple-A, and your mom was trying to cook, but the RV tipped so far to the side that she couldn't set anything on the counter...\"",
            "\"...And all we could do was just pass the ball on the side of the road, wondering whether or not we were gonna make the game.\"",

My mind doesn't want me to be happy.\" I nearly fall out of the folding chair when I'm talking with my arms. \"We're not forced to get out there anymore. To meet new people, to keep friendships alive. All our friends are getting married or serious while we're just left behind.

            "\"So we're already finished. Is that as bad as it gets? Or is this just because it's the first day?\" Pax asks. \"Maybe Aldrin wasn't lying. I thought we'd be at the enemy's doorstep most days, waiting for one of them to break through.\" He chows down on a raw potato that he withdraws from his pocket, spitting scraps with every syllable. \"But this is great — a little work for as much produce as you can eat!\"",
            "\"As long as you don't get caught, you idiot,\" Ryder says.",
            "The two hike behind us as the sky shifts to dusk, eclipsing all the light from the setting sun. I can feel slivers of potato catching in my hair. Bertram and I shiver in their shade as we struggle for footing, stumbling down the switchbacks of the southern foothills. Despite the half-baked ramblings that often get him in trouble, Pax is right this time. There wasn't a single scouting mission on the board beyond patrolling the town.",
            "Does it really get this easy?",
            "I wait until the switchback slithers east and the trail straightens, catching the fading light on my first quest form. It's stamped and scribbled with an illiterate farmer's signature, dirtied from folding by my soil-soaked fingers. Something catches my eye before we turn another corner: a small statement that the guildscribes helped the farmer write, the only part of the form scrawled in coherent letters.",
            "\"Hah, did you see this section?\" I ask Bertram. Pax and Ryder look over our heads without bending. \"List the concern and how it demands the strength of the Royal Guard's Knights.\"",
            "Bertram squints, reading the two words before a laugh seizes his throat. ",
            "Ryder reads it instead.",
            "\"Defending vegetables.\"",
            "\"From what?\" Pax asks. \"Hungry bellies?\"",
            "We share a laugh.",
            "\"If this is as hard as it gets, then this is a vacation,\" Pax says, showing us his large, calloused hands. \"I grew up on the outer farmlands of the Capital, working fields from dawn to dusk. Every day I was strapped for time. But this was nothing.\"",
            "Bertram agrees. \"Farming up here is practically a hobby with how that town in the North supplies us. Blackwater, I think? They supply the whole damn capital, but shouldn't they be covered in frost?\"",
            "I agree. ",
            "\"Most maps don't even chart the land north of the Purgatory Mountains,\" I say. \"It should be a frozen wasteland.\"",
            "\"It sure is. I used to live there, up in Blackwater,\" Ryder says. It's probably the first fact he's volunteered since I met him.",
            "\"No way. I've never met someone from up there,\" I say. ",
            "\"Me neither,\" Pax says. \"I guess there's no reason to leave when there's no chance to starve, right?\"",
            "\"There's no reason to leave because you can't. Not unless you spend your whole life plotting an escape.\"",
            "The words are enough to halt us.",
            "\"An escape?\" Bertram asks. \"Why would you have to escape? I thought they were part of the empire. Some kind of commune of field-hands and farmers, with enough Essence to keep the climate year-round.\"",
            "\"There's not enough Essence in all of Fosroth to allow that,\" Pax adds. \"Trust me. The Capital lands are unworkable in the winter. I couldn't even use a spade on them before I left. So I can't even imagine working the lands up there.\"",
            "\"That's because the lands are—\"",
            "His words cut off when a crimson glow saturates the northern hills. We're too slow to shield our eyes when a blinding light flashes from beyond the Purgatory Mountains, as if brought by Ryder's invocation.",
            "It barely catches our eyes as we descend the southern foothills. Any one of us could have missed it if we blinked at the wrong time. But before we can second-guess this shared experience — held as a glow in our retinas when we close our eyes — we find the faintest column of crimson light stretching skyward, like a glowing thread tethering our world of Fosroth to the stars.",
            "It fades like lightning before we have the time to speak its presence. An eerie silence overshadows the town. The wind withdraws with bated breath. The crickets refuse to rub their wings. But to us — a naive band of knights that only know battle through secondhand stories — it's the truest evidence of a war we've gotten yet, and it runs my skin with gooseflesh.",
            "Our pace hastens down the treacherous trail. The trembling words fill every inch of impedance that keeps us from an outright sprint.",
            "\"I thought the war was contained to the east, not the north! How would they even get around that far?\" Paxton huffs.",
            "\"It'd be almost impossible for the enemy to take Blackwater,\" Ryder says.",
            "\"But the column was red!\" Bertram says. \"There's surely a Mask up there that just did something. It might have even been their Divine Wish...\"",
            "\"You mean they just jettisoned all their Essence?\" I ask. Essence on the order of the Gods breaks the very laws of this world. Only a select few carry the blessing in their blood. But using it all at once comes at the cost of life.",
            "We tap our circuits for Essence, for the strength in our legs to descend faster and faster, predicating the call to Gaffesend Base. The trail ends on the side of the long, wrapping road we tried to cut, and then it's a dead sprint. ",
            "I refuse to be late on the first day. My sickening fear and small size propel me far ahead of the others, drawing on more anxiety than Essence as I tear past the landmarks of our small town. The trail transitions from matted dirt to concrete, to cobblestone, then back to concrete, until I'm rushing along the west edge of the lake in the military district: dragged forward by the weight of the thin breastplate; begged by my burning lungs to stop or else I might collapse into the water."

            "I pass the threshold of the gate, gasping for breaths as my last sprint dissolves into a jog. It becomes immediately obvious that weren't the only ones to notice: most of the recruits gather outside the guard post, swarming around the re-purposed adventurers' guild like flies to excrement. ",
            "I spot my brother Erik leaning against the doorframe.",
            "\"What's happening?\" I ask.",
            "\"Some major Essence event.\"",
            "\"Yeah, we saw it. We were on the southern hills.\" ",
            "I gasp for breath. He hands me his canteen. One long drink later, I find my mouth wet enough to continue.",
            "\"Should we be afraid?\"",
            "\"Afraid? Guards aren't supposed to be afraid,\" he says, staring down at me with our father's amber eyes.",
            "\"Not afraid . . . I meant concerned,\" I say. My mind's too busy redirecting resources to my starving muscles, and I can feel it in the heat of my flushed face.",
            "\"I don't think so.\"",
            "I try to slide past him to get in, but he traps me with his brazen arms. \"Relax,\" he says. \"You're going to be fine. You know I wouldn't let anything happen to you.\"",
            "\"I know that,\" I tell him.",
            "\"You always get so damn worked up. Just breathe,\" he demands. \"We're safe here in the city.\"",
            "I draw several long breaths in my nose and out my mouth before he releases me, just as Bertram, Pax, and Ryder finally catch up.  We enter the main room of the command post, packed to the walls with knights and soldiers. In the corner, the Line Type machines send a one-way barrage of signals across wires. There are three of them: one for the war front, one for the capital, and one that's used for up north, rarely getting an answer to anything.",
            "\"Status of Blackwater?\" Aldrin orders.",
            "\"Clearing the line right now to get their response,\" a guard says.",
            "Loud chirps on the line screech with the strain of such distance. The vibrations resonate different-shaped keys that dance in their fixtures, stamping against a swiftly scrolling sheet of paper. A long half-minute passes, and the guard impatiently waits until there's enough information to report on.",
            "\"Blackwater is safe,\" the guard says first. \"A civilian event in the north district. General Ullrich sending Royal Guard to investigate, not a Mask event, full stop,\" he says.",
            "The room breathes a collective sigh of relief.",
            "\"Was it perpetrated by Chymaeran meddling?\" Aldrin asks.",
            "\"I don't think so,\" he says. \"I—\"",
            "\"We don't 'think' here! We speak when we know, and we know when we do,\" he barks. ",
            "\"Uh-Understood, sir.\"",
            "\"Relay to the Valensends in the Capital. And send it to the boys at the front, so they don't have something extra to stress over tonight,\" he says.",
            "\"Prompting the line,\" the others say, setting the mechanical keys in position.",
            "Aldrin turns from the command zone to address the mix of soldiers and guards. \"Looks like an oddity: maybe Essence stores ignited. If it was a Divine Wish, we would know it — it surely would have done a lot more damage. I've heard some group up there called the 'Carmine' hoards dead Essence, so maybe it was them,\" he says.",
            "He turns to the guildscribes.",
            "\"We'll run a couple scouting parties, just in case. Write up some quest forms for the new knights: this is a good excuse to get some experience and some exercise.\"",
            "The guildscribes nod before he turns to us again, waiting until all the novice knights file in through the double doors.",
            "\"Things should die down in a week, but we're going to keep the city on alert. We want to be sure that the Chymaera aren't using this as an opportunity to strike.\"",
            "I know what he's going to ask for next when his eyes dart between the new recruits. I try to dissolve into the crowd, hoping the discomfort in my chest is just exhaustion from running across the town.",
            "\"I need volunteers for night watch, to head north and see what's going on,\" he says. \"It's worth a quest. Extra work means an extra day off.\"",
            "I falter when I'm shoulder-to-shoulder with my colleagues. Guilt and shame tug me forward, but that same crushing feeling I found in the cabin is so much stronger.",
            "\"This is easy. No more than several hours,\" he says.",
            "You're all going to do this, is what I hear.",
            "I can only watch as my colleagues step forward, arranging themselves in groups, but I taste the smoke. I'm snared in the past. I can see the Chymaerans and their glowing, amethyst eyes as they penetrate the shattered glass windows, stretching with their sharp obsidian limbs to finish what the fire began.",
            "This self-immolating spite can only swell when the lust for flight outpaces fight. My hands run cold as if the Chymaeran Curse were churning in my circuits, chilling my veins, and I have to lean against the wall to catch a breath.",
            "Bertram follows me outside. I'm fortunate that the others are too distracted to witness this moment of utter weakness.",
            "\"What's going on, Kat?\"",
            "\"I feel sick,\" I tell him.",
            "\"Right now? All of a sudden?\" He asks.",
            "I feel like I'm going to lose my breakfast and lunch. It's only then that he realizes he's drawing attention.",
            "I feel a shock pulse my body when the worst comes to pass, unable to speak or explain when Aldrin steps outside.",
            "\"What's going on here?\" Aldrin asks.",
            "I don't want to look weak, but maybe I should just tell him. There's no way out of this. After I think I have a grasp on my nausea, I open my mouth to speak.",
            "But Bertram beats me to it.",
            "\"She's been feeling sick since the farm,\" he says. \"They were trying to be nice with the samples and the free meal, and we were trying to be respectful: first day, you know. But after all the running...\"",
            "\"She seemed fine minutes ago,\" Aldrin says.",
            "I doubt this farce will work. I say, \"No, I—\"",
            "\"Because she didn't want to look weak on the first day,\" Bertram says. \"Don't you know how hard it is for her? She talked to me the whole way back about it, being a female guard and all, trying not to prove the stereotype.\"",
            "\"Oh,\" Aldrin says. He approaches, placing his glove on my shoulder. \"I respect that. We refuse to have that kind of backwards thinking in our ranks. We're trying to get rid of it. But you're not of use to me if you're not at your best,\" he says.",
            "I can feel the cold night air again. I manage to stand upright without the wall.",
            "\"T-thank you,\" I say, wiping my mouth, although my stomach and its contents are still there.",
            "\"Go home and get some rest: this is hardly a task, I just wanted an excuse to give you junior guards some exercise,\" he tells me. \"And Berry—would you mind walking her home?\" He hands two quest forms to him. \"Bring these back to me tomorrow. I'll give you credit.\" And then he whispers: \"Just don't tell anyone else.\"",
            "\"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir,\" Bertram says, taking my arm before he escorts me towards the complex. We make sure to pass the gates before we drop the act."

            "\"What was that about?\" Bertram asks. The grasp of his hands on my torso is so strong that I hardly have to walk.",
            "\"I ... I don't know,\" I tell him. \"I thought I got over this. I thought I wasn't so damn weak and pathetic...\"",
            "\"You're not pathetic! You earned your presence here,\" he assures me. \"You had a bad day, is all.\"",
            "\"But how can I last when it's really down to the wire, when it's real, if my mind fights me at something so simple, so stupid and pathetic and weak, like this?\" I let out an exasperated groan. If he wasn't holding me, I might bash myself in the face with my gauntlets.",
            "\"We'll take it step-by-step. You have time. Space in some scouting missions between the banal tasks,\" he insists.",
            "\"But that was the first step. It was a step down. It was so low that it couldn't have even been called a step, and I tripped,\" I tell him, feeling the tears well up in my eyes. \"We went through the same thing that day, how does it not come back to haunt you? Why don't you run? Why are you so still?\"",
            "\"I don't know,\" he tells me, still holding me upright when all I want to do is crumble. \"I just live in the absolute present. I just find that I'm less attached to it all: maybe I just don't care what happens.\"",
            "\"What does that even mean?\" I ask, wiping my eyes.",
            "\"I don't know. Maybe I'm just bad at describing it,\" he says. \"Maybe...\"",
            "I can feel him quickly release his hands when he realizes he's holding me up by the contours of my breastplate.",
            "\"Sorry.\"",
            "The suddenness gets me to crack a smile. It escalates further. Pretty soon we're both laughing, and I wipe the tears from my eyes.",
            "\"But really, though. I promise that I'll always have your back. I won't go off and die on you,\" he says.",
            "\"You better not,\" I tell him, still letting off a couple chuckles before my lungs settle. \"We'll defend some more vegetables tomorrow. Maybe even something more dangerous.\"",
            "\"Really sharp carrots?\"",
            "\"Maybe.\"",
            "\"I'll look forward to it,\" he says.",
            "There's a certain hesitation in him when he stands close, as if there's something more he wants to say. But the moment passes. Instead, he hands me my copy of the quest sheet.",
            "\"Well,\" he says. \"I guess I'll see you tomorrow.\"",
            "\"Until tomorrow,\" I say.",
            "I wave to him as I fumble for the key in my pocket; feeling for the name etched into the iron; making sure it's still there; praying to the Gods that it won't be ground any further. There's a sweet smell of grilled meat that makes me hungry: someone cooks a pig on a spit across the way. ",
            "Longing for rations after a long day, I turn my head to the entry window, trying to decide what I'll make. But instead, I find an odd, unflickering light illuminating the walls.",
            "\"Huh.\"",
            "My body is out of adrenaline, so I'm strangely calm. I approach the window instead of the door, trying to remember if I latched the back window after getting free breakfast from the merchants. I press my ear to the thin, wavy glass for an auditory cue: unable to see clearly through the drawn curtains, holding my breath until I hear the words of a foreign tongue. The words lack the harshness of Chymaeran dialect. Maybe it's Ahkvasan? Auvryan or Verdalan? One of the old dialects?",
            "I can only make out the silhouette of a stumbling man, holding something thicker than a rapier but thinner than a sword. He doesn't seem to be taking anything. Maybe this is a test — maybe Aldrin didn't mean it and wants to see if my actions can match my claims to courage.",
            "I approach the front door, allowing the burgeoning anger of my incompetence to consume me, leaving no space for fear. My hand is steady, unsheathing the dagger as I gingerly turn the key in the lock until it clicks. There's no room for explanation that this isn't a test or a burglar, so I let the Essence saturate my circuits.",
            "I turn the handle and rush the intruder. I spring forward with such force that the floorboards nearly snap when they give. My circuits run hot with Essence. My hands glow orange with heat, ready to burn their flesh until they beg to be sent to the Reservoir of Souls. ",
            "I cross the entire span of the bottom floor.",
            "But just before I'm ready to deal his death, he turns to face me, and I'm unable to reconcile the oddness of his appearance.",
            "The man looks no older than I am, somewhere halfway mixed between a Royal and a vagrant. The fineness of his silken shirt is accented with a checkered pattern of light blue boxes. The fabric is whiter than snow. His stubble is unkempt and shaggy though his light brown hair is clipped finer than all the royals I've ever seen. His brown eyes widen with panic as I intercept him, casting him over the kitchen table, and against the back wall, searing the fabric of his fine shirt with fire before I can withdraw the heat from my hands.",
            "He drops the strange sword against the ground, and it looks like a metal training stick that ends with a basket, not even a blade. ",
            "Is it a broom? Is he some kind of housekeeper hired by the Royal Guard, another service like the knocker?",
            "He's far too weak to put up a fight when I straddle him against the floor, his face smudged in the puddle of porridge I left when I was rushing out the door. He's so weak that I have to lighten my grasp or else I might break his bones.",
            "It's then that he spills his first string of words to me. And somehow, I understand them perfectly."

            "\"I swear, I didn't break in here,\" he insists. His face is redder than mine. He covers his crotch with his hands, as if hiding the pitched tent can make me forget. \"The door was open. I just walked in.\"",
            "\"The door was locked, you fool,\" I say, pointing to the narrowly-cracked entry door behind me, but he gestures with his head to the small closet. \"The closet? How would you break in through a damn closet? There's no windows in there.\"",

            "\"Do you want to be executed for apostasy? Because I can do that for you, right now,\" I notice that his eyes keep falling on the closet. The closet, my bare legs, my breastplate, and then the closet. I circle between him and the door, leaving only the entrance as an escape: like coaxing a rat out of the house without having to kill it.",
            "\"What I want is to go home,\" he says. \"Not to get stabbed by a letter opener. I'm your neighbor, and the door between our units was open.

            "\"No. Of course not, you're very convincing.\" His voice crackles on every other syllable, trying to inject some abject form of flattery. \"It's amazing. Prop knife? Form-fit foam from the craft store, spray-painted to look like metal armor? Even the stitching looks like an eighteenth-century corset. I can tell you've put a lot of time into it. You're a lot like my older cousin, and I'm sure you have loads of followers like she does. I know I'd follow you.\"",

I expect him to go cry fowl to his underpaid servants, to his nanny, or to his absentee parents, complaining all way up the chain to my captain. I sincerely hope he does, because Aldrin is backwater enough to hate anything that wears its wealth and wreaks of privilege.",

            "But it still bothers me. Why was he so drawn to the shallow closet? Even under duress, I don't know how he could be stupid enough to insist he entered through a door. There's surely nothing in this column of a cottage worth breaking into — especially into the home of a Royal Knight — unless he's some devious cretin that is after my intimates.",

            "Or at least I thought it was a closet. ",
            "The space beyond the door frame spans for less than a foot before the faint candlelight is swallowed by darkness. But the darkness is so dense and miasmic, like peering through murky water.",
            "The tunnel opens itself to me as I approach the door. From the lines implied by the floors and walls, the small cupboard should be no deeper than a couple feet (enough to store winter uniforms and snowshoes for the cold season), but I find no definite end. The edge where the splintered floor meets the jagged wall just fades into obscurity, all the way though to the unit on the other side, where an unfamiliar twinkle of multicolored lights pierce the smooth walls.",
            "The corridor might be short, but it's still just a little too long. The neighboring wall would have to be deeper than the walls around Fort Gaffesend!",
            "It must be a trick of his.  He could be a cross-blood like Pax, except Auvryan; able to mess with minds; skilled enough in his race's  gift to conjure convincing illusions with his Essence. Maybe that's why he seemed so powerless with his Human gifts. Maybe he conjured that splitting headache before I barged in, or maybe he speaks through thoughts, unaccustomed to verbal speech, speaking words of a foreign language though my mind heard something else. Is my mind being twisted further, to show something that isn't there? Does he still deceive me from beyond the door? I refuse to fall for this pathetic excuse of a trick, so I decide to test the bewildering portal.",
            "I reach first with my gauntlet, dragging through the viscous black as if collapsing spiderwebs. I notice the breeze at my back, strong enough to pierce the layers of my uniform, ushering me deeper and deeper. My trembling hand passes where the wall should be, and then my arm, and then the rest of my body, and as all the sound of the quaint cottage and the outside world fade behind me, I realize I'm twice as deep as the rules of space should allow. I think of the old stories of the Verdalans, the masters of space whose bodies descended from the fibrous jungle, defending their ancient capital with an infinite wall of twisting jungle. Just as their Essence warped space, entrapping their adversaries in endless loops of attrition, I feel my stomach twist as my senses confirm a truth that the mind refuses to accept.",
            "The room is dark, and though I can't make out the meager spread of items, I can sense how strange the shapes in this room are: so smooth and straight, as if they were cut by divine hands. When I find a glint in the artifacts on the shelves and walls—even the shelves themselves—I marvel at how much metal must have been wasted to produce all these things. He must be rich if he can waste money like this: maybe he's so rich that he bribed the Guard to let him live here, in a prime spot looking across the water.",
            "Does he actually live next door? Did I really mistake this as a closet? My metal boots clatter like hooves against the reflective wood floor, and I trace my finger along the polished granite table, trying to imagine how the resources got here.",
            "A crunch startles me. On the floor are what looks like hand-painted ration cans, but they're all crushed and ruined.",
            "I'm startled again when I hear snoring in the corner, and I find another odd stranger. A friend? A lover? Maybe a visitor past curfew? My feet sink into the carpet when I approach him, wondering again how the scruffy noble could ever afford such luxurious flooring.",
            "The entire room stinks of man, but this one smells especially bad. He mumbles in a drunken stupor before he awakes, blinking his eyes like a toad.",
            "\"Uh . . . hey.\"",
            "\"Hello,\" I say, wishing I had not ditched the dagger.",

            "\"A hose? Why would you—\" I begin to ask, but he cuts me off.",
            "\"I think he's upstairs,\" he tells me, squinting his eyes, and then some semblance of recognition crosses his face. \"Wait a minute — you must be from that fantasy escort service down in Denver, what was it called, uh . . . Call To Adventure, or something like that?\"",
            "\"I only do escort missions through the Royal Guard,\" I say.",
            "\"Hah. Good one,\" he says.",
            "\"It is good,\" I say.",
            "\"Good.\" He clicks his tongue. \"Figures. My boy Cody could never score a baddie like you.\"",
            "\"Cody,\" I say.",
            "\"Yep.\"",
            "An odd name.",

            "Another odd name.",

You might be here for just a night — and, look, I know the whole thing about falling in love with a call girl — but give him a chance, huh? Even if it's just a booty call thing,\" he says.",
            "His hand grazes the table, accidentally casting some black, slender object on the floor. It bounces twice before colliding with something else. I hear a click, and then behind me, a flash of colorful light envelops the room. I gasp when I turn to look, and my heart jumps into my throat.",
            "Behind the bright window, a mother and daughter are screaming at each other. It gives me such a start that I collapse into the couch. The woman is screaming, the daughter is screaming, I'm screaming, and the man is shouting, trying to free himself from my armor.",
            "I spew a string of apologies as the woman in the window says something about wanting her body back, just as all I want is to go home. Too panicked to realize that the best direction is from whence I came, I sprint for the door as the other guy curses, grasping his leg.",
            "I'll just go around like Cody. We'll trade places.",
            "Just like my intruder, I trip backwards out the door, scraping the edges of the cement with my plate armor as I slide down the sculpted stairs, coming directly to a stop beneath a blinding torchlight. I scramble to my feet to try and run, but everything is so bright and unfamiliar that I fall to my knees.",
            "The sky is cloudless, but I can't find a single star. Lake Garrison is nowhere to be found; instead of the distant lights of my hometown of Hillfar, a pattern of white-and-red dotted lights slide past each other on a hill, somewhere far beyond the eaves of two houses on the other side of the road.",
            "Something loud is approaching. I try to curl into a ball to protect myself, but the armor stiffens me too much. A massive automobile tears past, lighting the entire street with headlamps lodged in the front, unlike anything I've ever seen. It sounds like they have an entire orchestra in there behind the glass, but the deafening music fades . . . only to be replaced by two more loud metal chariots that shake the ground.",
            "I'm quivering as I lay there in the grass, wondering where the garden is; why the lake isn't directly across from me; why stars shifted in the sky so swiftly. ",
            "An old woman walks on the side of the street, and I consider she's a lamplighter until I see her holding a leash. She notices me crumpled in the grass on the verge of tears.",
            "\"Are you alright, sweetheart?\" She asks.",
            "\"No,\" I cry.",
            "Her familiar crosses the grass, nuzzling me with its wet nose before it licks my face.",
            "\"Oh, that's Doby. She's real friendly with all the young'uns living around here — do you mind dogs? Or are you more of a cat person?\"",
            "\"I'm a human person. A living human—\"",
            "\"—I swear to the good Lord in heaven: if this neighborhood is turning into one of those 'college' towns the Facebook talks about, with all these young'uns in their new houses playing trapping music, I'm going to lose it!\"",
            "I haven't the time to protest when I hear a hissing noise, and it sounds like the elder is conjuring a serpent. Before I can react, I feel a cloudless rain, followed by a direct blast of water to my face, saturating the clothes beneath my armor in seconds.",
            "\"Why? Why do you torment me?\" I plead, my tears now inseparable from the water soaking me down to my underwear. ",
            "\"I didn't set the timer on those sprinklers,\" she says, and then adds, \"damn beatnik.\"",
            "As I kneel in the muddy grass, sullying my new pants, I watch as the cantankerous woman retreats, dragging the mutt alongside her. A single, white moon hangs in the sky. Blinking red and white flashes somewhere even higher, casting smoke in a faint line, leaving the sound of a crackle as it slices the sky. I never knew the sky could be torn. ",
            "With my mind petrified, locking my muscles, resigning me to soak in the jets of water, my body decides for me, urging me back inside to pass Cody's cursing companion.",
            "All I want is to return to the comfort of Fosroth where the world is uncomplicated. I want a cup of tea and a book beside the fire as I warm my bones. I will never bear witness to this horrifying illusion again.",
            "I ignore his companion's threat to take shots, though he holds a bottle instead of a gun, — asking if his friend paid for any more guards to defend this house. But as I stumble towards the closet, squeaking my saturated boots with each step, all I find is another figure, standing there at the back of the closet."

            "If it's a sword fight he wants, I know I can make it to the greatsword leaning against the wall, because if this Auvryan cross-blood wants to wreak havoc on my home life with his illusions, sullying the most sacred place I have to replenish myself and find respite, then I have no other choice. ",
            "He must be destroyed.",
            "Cody drags his left foot behind him, bending his knees, leaning his body in a forward squat as if that can stop me. Surely this assassin is an Auvryan, and likely some kind of mercenary: their people are masters with pole weapons. But I doubt his technique is greater than the strength of a full-blooded Human flooded with Essence.",
            "I charge with my armored left shoulder, allowing the Essence to flow into my legs, flooding my muscles with such power that every step deflects the floorboards. I close the distance faster than he expects, but he remains steadfast, standing there with the metal broom raised to chest height, hinging his arms to receive the full force of my momentum.",
            "It's when I'm three steps from deliverance that he bends to get under me — but my muscle memory is far faster. I lower myself further than he can, sliding beneath the pole, driving my metallic shoulder into his chest and blasting him in the air.",
            "He lets out a rasping wheeze when his ribs bend towards his lungs. He's lucky that nothing inside him breaks: maybe it's the alcohol on his breath that hints that his muscles are loose, and that he's feeling a little braver than he might be otherwise.  Cody crashes against my wall, leaving a sizable divot in the aged wallpaper, and before the ground reclaims him, I manage to snag the greatsword with my left hand, dragging it across the floor to assume a defensive stance. ",
            "Somehow, he still manages to death-grip the broom between his hands, coughing and gasping for air as he lifts himself to his feet, overflowing with adrenaline and rage that radiate in his reddening face.",
            "I realize I left him an opening to escape. I expect him to cower, retreating to his conjured illusion to never return. But he flips the broom end of the stick to face him, exposing a sharp, hollow edge. ",
            "His hapless courage is admirable. Maybe I would have fallen for him if this were training, and we were on the same side of the war.",

            "\"I need to be sure you can't ever ruin my peace again.\"",

            "\"I was trying to tell you that the door was open. What the hell kind of neighbor are you?\"",

            "The sword traces a faint line in the wooden ceiling before gravity does the rest of the work. It clashes with the broom — and I fully expect it to break through — but all my greatsword does is well a deep notch in the hexagonal shaft.",
            "He mutters something about the material, cursing about how this broom is personal to him, but I know very little of the Auvrya or their traditions. My blade releases sparks when I try to pull it back, grinding against the notch, but the further I pull, the higher the blade climbs. ",
            "I hear the screech of metal-on-metal, and it seems it's his turn to close the distance. He grinds the pole against the sharp edge, driving the sword higher and higher until it falls behind my hands. I'm left defenseless, and he jabs the plastic head of the stick against my breastplate, driving me to the floor."

            "My mind races, but I still manage to remember the bloody dagger in the sink.",
            "I roll behind the kitchen island as he brandishes the head of the stick against a wooden bowl on the counter, casting a whole slew of produce against the ground.",
            "I lift myself by the counter's edge to dig my hand into the sink, feeling for the hilt of the dagger. ",
            "\"Your fight is with me, not the damn house!\" I say.",
            "He bends down to scoop up one of the apples with the stick, taking it into the basket. I level the dagger at him, taking a butcher's knife in my other hand, completely unsure of what he's going to do next.",
            "His hands shift to the sharp end of the stick, leaving the basket at a certain length behind him. ",
            "Then he whips it down as hard as he can. ",
            "The apple whizzes past my head, exploding against the stone wall, casting chunks of its sugary flesh and skin into my hair.",
            "\"I should have practiced since the club team sophomore year,\" he says, slurring his words. \"Next one's going corner-pocket in your damn eye socket.\"",
            "\"Not if I end you first,\" I say.",
            "The assassin scoops up an orange with a single flick of his wrist. I ready the knife block. He launches a second one, but I'm quick enough to slice it with my dagger before it blasts me in the forehead. ",
            "My eyes burn with the citrus, and when I think he's reeling to throw something harder — like a pear or another apple — squinting as I wipe the juice with my dagger hand, I use my unpracticed off hand to flick the kitchen knife through the air.",
            "It spins several times before embedding itself into the wall behind him. He freezes. I set the dagger on the counter, taking three more kitchen knives into my left hand, certain that I can hit dead-center now that my dominant hand is free.",
            "I whip a second one, letting the Essence tension the fibers of my muscles, launching the paring knife faster than an arrow. ",
            "But he's already pitching up the overturned kitchen table. ",
            "The tablecloth hovers to the floor like melting ectoplasm before the paring knife pins it to the table. Cody lets out a yelp in fear, surely unhurt since the blade is far shallower than the thick mahogany. ",
            "I decide to upgrade to a carving knife, withdrawing all five inches from the block. I judge its balance. ",
            "He peeks from behind the table, and I whip the carving knife where I expect his chest to be, thinking it's his body that braces the table upright. ",
            "But he bends back. ",
            "It stabs through almost up to the handle.",
            "\"Holy hell,\" he exclaims.",
            "I wind up to throw another as he pulls the small knife from the wallpaper, then throw it. The boring knife spins through the air, nearly pinning his hand to the wall. He catches me off guard when he emerges from the side of the table. I reach for another culinary weapon, but I realize my offhand is out of blades.",
            "The oddly-dressed assassin flips the blade to set the sharp edge between his fingers, his eyes dark and piercing as he raises his elbow and lifts the knife behind his head. The panic seizes my heart: this assassin's skilled enough to engage a vetted Royal Guard when he's two sheets to the wind. I'm certain a knife will soon be in my chest, and all I can do is ready myself for the deliverance of cold steel.",
            "And then he throws it.",
            "I expect it to fly so fast that I can't catch a glimpse of its glistening edge before it embeds itself between my breastplate. I expect my consciousness to end, to wash in the next fated moment upon the Reservoir of Souls. ",
            "But I can see it.",
            "And it's not coming at me.",
            "It flies so far to the right that I wonder if he's aiming at something else. The paring knife spins horizontally through the air, twirling and spinning with such disarray that it only makes it halfway to the kitchen before it clatters against the floor.",
            "\"Damn it!\" he says.",
            "The laugh escapes before my hands cover my mouth. I can't even stop the loud snort. His face is crestfallen, even more hurt than the time I rammed him.",
            "\"You should stick with that strange basket-stick of yours,\" I tell him.",
            "Cody's voice wavers. \"It's called a lacrosse stick,\" he says, blushing hard, peeking over the edge with his glasses as he struggles to withdraw the carving knife from the other side. ",
            "I thought he was an Auvryan mind-flayer — a mythical master of mental manipulation, maybe commissioned by the Chymaera. But he's no warrior. Just a stupidly-brave commoner that's overconfident in his skills. And a complete idiot.",
            "I can't stop laughing. ",
            "\"What are you, some kind of combat janitor? Do you sweep floors with that thing?\"",
            "His face reddens further, whether it's the booze, his humiliation, or both.  I feel the relief wash over me as the Essence retreats from my circuits. ",
            "\"Gods above, for a second I thought you were an actual threat,\" I say.",
            "\"Who says I'm not?\" He scoops a tomato into the 'cross stick', poised to whip another one.",
            "\"Just . . . stop,\" I tell him. \"I'm not going to kill a civilian.\"",
            "\"Maybe you should reconsider,\" he says.",
            "\"Consider this.\"",
            "I raise my hands and cast a controlled plume of flames. He flinches when they stop only inches from his face, dropping something hard and small from his pocket. He has to steady himself with the odd weapon as he stumbles towards the closet.",
            "\"Really, Cody. Do you even understand our training? How much Essence a Royal Guard is conditioned with? How much mead does it take to get this kind of courage? I could snap your bones with my hands!\"",
            "\"I'm your neighbor. I live right next door . . . through there,\" he says, lifting a bare arm exposed by his scalded shirt to point towards the closet. ",
            "\"Why are you living in the military district?\"",
            "\"I live in Hearthland Ridge,\" he insists. \"The military base is down in Cheyenne, or maybe Fort Carson.\"",
            "\"This is Gaffesend,\" I tell him.",
            "\"No, this is Colorado. The United States,\" he says.",
            "\"Nothing is united in all of Fosroth. You can't be stupid enough to be a tourist at the war front!\" I say.",
            "\"The war is overseas. It's fought with drones and bombs.\"",
            "\"It's waged with swords and rifles!\"",
            "I approach him until I can smell the booze on his breath. My eyes flutter between his exposed chest and his arms, a little impressed at his definition when he obviously has no Essence. I catch him glimpsing at my bare thighs that once straddled him, and then to my breastplate, before returning my glare and slowly backing up towards the closet.",
            "But his heels catch on the threshold.",
            "He falls through the portal, unable to steady himself with his weapon before he crashes to the ground on the other side. I take one more glance at the horrors of that incomprehensible world: all its glistening, colored lights like Essenced lightning bugs. The fear forestalls me from passing that threshold ever again, so I stand there: watching; waiting; listening to the faintness of his breath; until I'm certain his intemperance will keep him there.",
            "But the fear of that other world overpowers my penchant for patience. I slam the door behind him, certain I'll never have to face that stranger again."

            "Late Sunday morning, around 11:00, I awoke with my neck twisted against the closet door, my face saturated with drool, shirt missing, and a sticky note taped to my forehead with Miguel's handwriting that read \"DRINK WATER.\" The pounding headache had mostly subsided: I must have slept it off, or drank loads of water the night before from how quickly I immediately had to sprint to the restroom. And after relieving myself, I found my phone on the counter with three unread texts:",
            "Miguel Ruelas // 06:37u gotta tell me whassup with that wack cosplay chick. neighbor? break-in? u invite rollplay hookers over when i was asleep?",
            "Miguel Ruelas // 07:13or shit maybe I dreamt it, doesnt explain the bruise on my leg unless something happened that i forgot",
            "Miguel Ruelas // 07:14anyways congrats bro on the house. lets catch up next week im off to church. cleaned up some of the mess. love u bro",
            "I looked around to find that the madman actually cleaned everything. The pillows were arranged on the couch, the beer cans sorted into the recycling bin outside, and even the counters looked like he gave them a clean wipe. I responded: ",
            "Cody Dunsmore // 11:12Thanks for cleaning up dude, you didn't have to do that! Let's chill next weekend. Not much else to do when everyone moved away :/",
            "Feeling disgusting, I rushed upstairs to take a shower, getting off the sweat and stench of a failed all-nigher. My shower thoughts brought me back to that dream in another world: getting slashed by a crazy roleplayer and encountering strangers in some semi-modern renaissance world. I looked down at my left hand, as if the warm shower water wasn't enough to tell me whether or not the flesh parted like a bad haircut. But all I found was smooth skin. ",
            "It must have been a shared dream, like Inception, because I still don't recall inviting anyone over: hell, I don't even know who to call. But as the scalding water relieves the pounding in my head, I find that all I can think of is the magical woman I fought in my dreams, how she straddled me, threw knives at me, and cleaved that heavy greatsword straight into the middle of my lacrosse stick. ",
            "I dried myself off before a different kind of pleasure could emerge from those thoughts: I was more absorbed by the strangeness of that vivid and continuous dream. My curiosity led me to try opening the door to the closet, finding another door behind it that looked as if its handle were blasted with a blowtorch. ",
            "I just assumed I'd forgotten there was no closet. Were these pre-builds originally intended for a hotel chain or something with the neighbor door? It didn't make sense at all, but I knew I wouldn't feel safe, and I was actively looking for any kind of excuse to make something stupid in my robotics workshop. ",
            "After a drive-thru breakfast, I went to the home improvement store to get one of those school-shooter-stopping door stops: one level shy of something permanent like bolting the damn door in place. With a spare microcontroller, I hooked up a hall-effect sensor and a buzzer — a magnet sensor and a loud speaker, basically — to detect if that door was ever to move. By soldering the wires to the breadboard, along with some AA batteries, and using generous dollops of hot glue to stick it to the inside wall of the strange-looking door, I called it a day around 9:30 PM, returning to my bed for an early night of sleep so I could get up tomorrow, only to spend four hours doom-scrolling through the week's sordid politics. ",
            "I consider all these details right now when I'm driving ten over the speed limit. It's not wondering if the notched cut in my lacrosse stick was from when Miguel and I were drunkenly tossing a tennis ball outside, nor is it my missing iPod Classic. It's how I could have possibly screwed myself over this bad. ",
            "I set three alarms. Either my dumb ass shut them off in succession, I slept through them, or I did bad math in figuring out the absolute latest I could wake up, forgetting that I had to take a shower. Now I'm screaming down the highway, hating myself as I KNOW that I'm going to either make it right on time or a couple minutes too late. ",
            "I skipped breakfast when that ulcerous, cantankerous feeling arrested my stomach, running the numbers over and over and over about how long it would take me to get there. Now I calculate every second as I pull into the last roadway snaking up into the canyon, taking tight turns that jostle my backpack against the back seat, nearly screeching my tires when I pull up to the front gate. ",
            "Eight fifty-three on the dashboard. ",
            "The gate guard waves me through. Apparently two years is long enough for him to remember my face. I clip the badge to my wrinkled work shirt and gather my bag when my Subaru fits in the last spot available, sneaking in the back door. ",
            "Eight fifty-eight. ",
            "I sneak in with the technicians finishing their first union-mandated break. The ones I worked with make fun of me for being lazy, calling me an \"eighter-skater\". ",
            "Eight fifty-nine. ",
            "I climb the stairs. The rows of cubes are empty, and the sinking feeling deepens. What room is the meeting in? Was it thirty minutes earlier? I'll have to guess since I didn't check mail or Teams. ",
            "Nine o'clock. ",
            "I try to calm my breathing or else I'll embarass myself further. Fuck, the door's shut. I open the door with a pad and paper in my other hand, meeting six sets of eyes as I retreat to the back, not a chair left for me to sit in. ",
            "\"Barely on time, Cody,\" Nav says. In the dark room, his face is only lit by the computer, and the window of emails is up on the projector. ",
            "\"I'm sorry. I—\" don't add kindling to the fire by using an excuse: I find I'm mostly out after this many years. ",
            "Navesh continues. \"As I was saying. I swear to be transparent with all of you when it comes to this stuff. They monitor what they tell me, because they know I'll just regurgitate it back to all of you, because you deserve that honesty,\" he says. ",
            "Our team looks on with a knot in their stomachs: to my left, the Robinson-Monroe lifers Wilford Sameshima, a mechanical, and Michael Leguziamo, an electrical. To my right, Kei Sakurajima tensions her nails against her slender arm as she watches me for my own reaction, and mid-rank electrical Scott Valdez buries his face in his notepad. ",
            "\"You all know the Aerospace Division was expecting the contract. Which means power cell assemblies to design, which means busy work making our existing models fit to their demands,\" Nav says. ",
            "Kei types something into her open computer. My wrist vibrates when she hits the return key: ",
            "SAKURA_KEI 09:02:15:I thought I had tenure?",
            "It's an inside joke from when we had several electives together, when a professor was fired right in front of us. She cracks a smile that she fights to hide, trying to lighten the tension just a little. The humor joins the emotions inside my chest like adding oil to water, and not much for words right now, I respond. ",
            "DUNSMO_COD 09:02:43:Guess not.",
            "Scott interjects, \"So when are we looking at here? For the . . . reduction of staff.\" ",
            "Even the lifers are afraid, tenured with all their tribal knowledge. Wilbur says, \"How many per group? I mean, we have a small team.\" ",
            "Nav predicates his next words with a warning. \"Now, I'm not sure about any of this because they refuse to tell it straight. We're looking at one to two people, maybe. And we're looking at just before Christmas.\" ",
            "\"Just in time to get gifts for my kids,\" I say, before realizing I've spoken. ",
            "\"You don't have kids,\" Kei says. ",
            "A nervous chuckle circles the room. Nav looks relieved that I tried to ligthen things: it feels like the first time I've been really useful to this team in a month. ",
            "\"They're probably going to ask me to make a list again, just like I did three years ago, some of you willl remember that. They're going to force me to rank you. And I'm sure you all know generally where you stand.\" I feel him staring at me through the back of his head: he doesn't have to turn around. ",
            "\"A team of six is already pretty damn small,\" Mike says, mumbling into his folded hands. \"We're probably the smallest in the company already.\" ",
            "\"Which might mean we're fine. But it's not just six of us anymore,\" Nav says. I can see the notification come across his computer: one of the executives is waiting to enter the meeting after it is over. ",
            "\"What do you mean?\" I ask, feeling my heart skip a beat. If it's HR, that means the reaper is taking someone away. ",
            "\"It's seven now. We vetted him before we lost the contract,\" Navesh says. ",

            "The executive walks in: it's my boss' boss, dressed to the nines, probably lost since someone like him would never even bother to step into a wing of the company like ours. Behind him is a dark-haired, clean-cut guy dressed like any of us used to: slacks, a belt, and a tucked-in collared shirt. Feels like we should stand at attention for such seniority, but I'm already up. The new recruit isn't nervous at all in introducing himself. "

It was five hours before IT could get my email working, and although Navesh was warm with his welcome, nobody stood from their cubes to do so much as introduce themselves. I had to bring my own 'new guy donuts' the next day to get the rest of the bean-counters and nerds to acknowledge my presence! ",

I don't know if you're just burned-out or something: you've been on the threshold of the next level for ages, and I get you're feeling restless, but . . .\" He pauses because the next words are uncomfortable. \"If I'm forced to make a list, I want you to be ready.\" ",

            "\"No, I like you, Cody,\" he reassures me, but I don't feel it. \"I don't pull the strings or drive the gears. I'm just a pinion between the executives and my team.\" An idler gear, only transferring the force it's given by the others. ",
            "It takes a couple breaths before I can bring myself to respond. \"I'll do better, then, whether it means something or not,\" I tell him. ",
            "\"Well, with all this idle time we're gonna have, we'll have a couple projects to improve stuff. Make stuff the customers don't know they want yet. For me, it was redesigning the battery enclosure that made me prove myself enough to move up. So maybe . . .\" ",
            "\"It's a chance, you're saying.\" ",
            "\"But not a promise.\" ",

            "\"I appreciate you telling me this,\" I manage, enough to get him to go away. As the first tear crests my eye, trying to suck it back into my tear duct, I take a deep breath and decide to take a break."

            "I take deep breaths as I try not to let him break me. Cody's gone now. And I will never have to deal with him again.",
            "I dig my heels into the space between the floorboards, catching my breath as I drive my back against the closet door. My nails tension against the pad of my palm, leaving crescents in my flesh as the blood drains from my fingertips. ",
            "My heart can only take so much in a day. I thought the enemy could only strike when my presence was voluntary; when I patrol the borders of Gaffesend by my own volition. And it only took a day for this peaceful haven to be violated by a stranger.",
            "I can't keep sitting here. The curse will catch me if I don't get up: the white feeling that tensions my hands and sets my body in full static.  The shorter the time between those moments of frantic stillness, the easier it slides into that incontrovertible state of shock. It's addiction without a pleasure to be addicted to, and the more often that white feeling haunts me, the stronger it gets — so I'm glad when I find my effects are still scattered across the floor. A mess to clean is the second-best thing to distract me right now: the first is going to the bar, but after my episode, I'd rather not be seen in public.",
            "I let my mind flow with visions of how I can transform this space into a place of respite, rather than feeling like an ephemeral halfway-house between training and the front lines.  The mind is a vessel that can only hold so much at a time, so I drink to the the purity of those beautiful thoughts, driving down the opacity of fear's murky brine. The pale white feeling fades as the light begins to shine through, reaching my furthest depths.",
            "When my hands stave off the static, I gather the courage to seal that passageway forever. ",
            "I let the Essence flood my circuits with enough heat to melt the handle of the closet door to the deadbolt, ensuring it's locked forever. Then I drag an empty bookcase across the floor to cover it. It irritates me that it's slightly spaced from the wall due to the protrusion of the melted handle, so I melt the rest of it, turning the balled handle into a flat plate pressed against the profile of the wooden door, deciding it's good enough to try to forget.",
            "I lack the Auvryan magic of mind, but I hypnotize myself anyway. ",
            "The bookcase has always been here.",
            "Next, I purge anything that reminds me of him. ",
            "I wipe his blood from the dagger. I return the fruit scattered across the floor into the bowl. I pull the kitchen knives from the overturned table and reset the tablecloth the other way around, covering the gaping holes in the wood. Finding the evidence is still in the fabric, I sew the clean cuts in the tablecloth closed with thread from my sewing kit. I mop and dab all the puddles and smudges. This leads to finding places for the hundred pounds of my unpacked personal items, placing them anywhere but the closet I should have forgotten, which leads to re-orienting all the decorations and furniture and bookshelf to make the space my own, which leads to dusting every surface I can find. Before long, I find my exasperated body sprawled across the kitchen's area rug, drugged by the excitement of exertion, staring at the cross-beams of the low wooden ceiling with a slight smile on my face. ",
            "I hoped so dearly that this distraction would let me forget. ",
            "But even still, I find the urge to reconcile that impossibility.",
            "I need to keep moving. I need to find something to fix when I can't leave this house. Since I can't patch the dent in the wall, I decide to look harder for any dust that might coalesce beneath the cabinets. I roll over to find the duster did its job well, but there's something else tucked under there.",
            "It's a strange, slender, rectangular object beneath the cutout of the kitchen cabinet. Like all the other things in his realm, it's perfectly smooth and square — but I can tell it's been worn from years and years of continuous use. It would look like an ingot if it wasn't so flat: hardly enough for a blacksmith to smelt it into anything. When I turn the heavy block in my hands, I find that I'm able to read the foreign words on the back, etched in white beneath an image of a bitten fruit:",

            "It takes me a while to figure it out, but when my finger glides on the circle, the little window changes. I settle the black bar on PICTURES, expecting a photograph to dispense from the tiny slot in the bottom. ",
            "I press the center button. ",
            "But instead, the window shows a gateway to an entirely different world. It reminds me of the moving projections that I heard were in the theatre rooms of the capital, though this one is so impossibly small — and there's not a creature in existence that could roll the image from inside. It reminds me of the screaming woman behind the window on the stranger's wall.",
            "There's so many tiny squares of color that make this picture, but it's still hard to make out. Two people sit at a table in a stone-walled room lit by a very bright lamp. One is small: just a boy, and the other is older, wearing some kind of green-and-brown uniform — sharp enough in dress that I figure he's a warrior.",
            "All I can tell is that they care for each other: sitting together building something metallic and square with wires hanging off of it. And they have this same device there, sharing the white buds between their ears. ",
            "I try the same with the round white shapes, but nothing happens. I click another button on the side. The screen goes black, reflecting my eyes on its worn, yet polished surface, and when I realize how time has passed, I look up at the hands of the clock. ",
            "Dear Gods above: a whole hour has passed. If I don't sleep now, dusk will overtake any chance of rest.",
            "I run upstairs with the device in my hand, leaving the square pod and its tangled wires as the first decoration on my nightstand. My body is exhausted from all the fear, and I don't have to even draw the covers to find myself in slumber. I just collapse onto the bed, retreating into a deep sleep where the smoke of the cabin across the lake never reaches me.",
            "My mind remembers the contours of Cody's body beneath the tattered shirt. I can't escape the thought in my dreams, no matter how much physical or mental furniture I pile against the sealed door.",

            "There's no early breaks in all the domestic quests. It only took a couple days before I realized that sitting on the job was a bad image, unless you have a lunch pail in your hands. Just like any routine — whether it's a new cycle of combat training, classes, or a new job — the first three days are memorable because it's all so fresh. I thought taking different quests would make each day distinct from the last, but from the fourth day onward, it all became a blur of motion, forgotten at the end of each day by an exaspirated body and a tired mind.",
            "This is the first job on city watch that has me raking leaves on the side. Though the mountainside is still flushed with fading green, the eager leaves transform from yellow to red and deposit themselves early on the stone thoroughfares. From a raised vantage point at the southwestern hillside of Gaffesend, I abate the stress by drawing in the crisp mountain air, watching as the browning wild lashes of the southern grasslands are battered about by gale winds.",
            "Long in the distance, the grand lake reflects the shadowed mountain view, too far to make the crests of little waves. I watch as junior guards paddle back from their postings on the outer rim, wondering which of my friends are among them. But it's nice to know that at least I'm not alone.I've gotten to know her a lot better: the shy pair well with the timid since they end up taking similar tasks. ",
            "\"When should we head down?\" Naya asks.",
            "\"Well there's certainly no shortage of leaves, the Verdalan Gods make sure of it. Maybe now, I guess,\" I tell her. \"This was all supposed to be done before the royals came to town, as if miles of road could be effectively polished by five junior guards.\"",
            "\"What does such a task even have to do with protecting?\" Naya mutters.",
            "\"We're protecting . . . the . . . image, I guess, of the city. And next we'll be protecting the parade route.\"",
            "\"Sometimes it feels like they're just trying to keep us busy with silly tasks,\" she says.",
            "\"It's allowed me to get to know the locals really well, at least. They say they're glad we take the tasks that make a difference.\"",
            "\"That's because you fawn for social interaction, it's quite marvelous to me how you're so full of energy all the time. But that's coming from someone who doesn't make friends unless they see them every day for about a month.\"",
            "\"A month?\" The math surprises me. But it sounds about right when I count all the days I've taken off. I walk with Oriya, Jullian, Berry, and Ryder every morning for five of them, to take new postings from the quest board and get to work. Every sixth or so, I persuade them to join me on a hike or go swimming in the hot springs. And every night is my chance to get out and socialize when I'm not taking night quests: having only scouted twice, I feel quite distant from the others.",
            "The loneliness carries into other areas, too. I've only seen Jullian five times since the start of this transition. Besides walking to work hand-in-hand, we've gotten together almost every day off to blow off some steam. I've only been able to convince him once to go on a date with me to the hot springs, and it was on my earnings. The other times he says he's too busy — though I always see him with his friends. It disappoints me when our acts of passion end as soon as he gets off: the only courtesy he seems to have is letting me get there first.",
            "We descend the hill as the northern scouts congregate in Gaffesend Square. The bell tolls midday: normally that would mean a break for rations, but our service is expected to run later, and nobody minds when it makes this a \"two-quest-day.\"",
            "\"I bet Bertram rues being sick when quest forms are this easy,\" I tell Naya. The slowness of this life almost makes me believe that Gaffe is as insular as the capital, capable of holding small events for royalty passing through the town. We're ordered to line up on the sides of the Main Street. It feels like a festival, the way all the street lamps are adorned with fresh flowers; the businesses shuttered for an hour; and the full population split between halves of the street. We stand in pattern between the onlookers and the empty road. The senior guards are busy on the city outskirts, demanding papers, and ensuring no Chymaeran spies are guising unwitting villagers. We hold the ceremonial rifles that we retrieved from the armory, clasped between our hands and upright, though Aldrin insists we \"can't be fully trusted with them yet,\" and that we need to \"train with a blade before we can handle them.\"",
            "My eyes steady on the vacancy in front of me on the other side of the road, originally intended to be held by Bertram. Before long, the shimmering white carriage prattles down the road, drawn by two black horses. They're looking to have a two-nights'-stay in the hot springs, and we're meant to prove to them that Gaffesend is safe, encouraging more tourists to make the trek to enrich our lands.",
            "I figure most of our population is excited for the presence of a Chosen Mask: we got the news that he was being paid to defend the carriage between villages. It's rare that anyone notable ever passes through, especially since we're the last stop before nothing. I can see him waving to his admirers from the coachman's seat as they cheer and throw flowers at the feet of the horses. Within the carriage, a finely-dressed family of six waves from the windows, wearing white and gold.",
            "I feel my hands loosen their tension on the rifle. The nagging feeling of fear that's plagued me since forever is almost in the back seat, and around me, I can drink to the exuberance of the town. To my left, Naya smiles, predictably not the type to cheer. To my right, Pax pumps his fist in the air. And Bertram is absolutely focused on the royals, standing there directly in front of me.",
            "The carriage is drawing closer, at least a hundred paces away. Some of the family's younger passengers have exited the carriage, walking alongside the road and tossing wrapped candies to the onlookers. The nagging feeling grows stronger. It's just too peaceful. And as my hands tension around the black steel, Bertram's eyes catch a glint of amethyst when he decides to make his move."

            "They're close enough to run me over, but my body's trained to react before I can think. Muscle memory comes before thought, thought before fear, and fear before true reaction, so it's only when I'm halfway across the road that the thoughts finally reach my muscles. The others are only beginning to notice when the Chymaeran fleshwalker raises the rifle. I'm the only one that happened to know enough and be close enough to respond, and when I try to take another step, I feel the gravity of my past flood my veins with molasses.",
            "I struggle to refuse the defenses of my own mind. I always swear I can taste the smoke from that fire when my heartbeat rises. And as the Chymaeran assassin guising my friend prepares to take aim and pull the trigger, all I can do is watch as I collapse to the street, giving the horses such a start that they shy and snort, rearing on their hind legs, casting the carriage forwards and backwards.",
            "Pax is quick on the uptake: for every dearth of common sense, he excels in his perception, tuned to that energy of the attacker. While the other junior guards only begin to notice, and the Chosen is left helpless in a battle of speed, the assassin pulls the trigger, spooking the horses and the spectators as Pax tackles him to the ground.",
            "I brace my head with my cheek brushing moss between the roadway stones. The coachman pulls the slip knot, and the horses' hooves clatter against the road, and I hold my breath, as if it could change the chances of the startled stallions shattering my spine or ribs. But they clamber right overhead, and as the carriage passes directly over my prostrated body lying straight with the road, I feel the wetness of something dense drip across my cheek.",
            "My ears still ring from the blast, but I can hear the cries of the children and the wife. And when I'm sure my whole body can still respond to its commands, I begin to crawl from beneath the carriage.",
            "\"May the gods damn your pathetic town and its useless guards,\" the wife says. \"It should be wiped off the face of the map!\"",
            "I begin to imagine the repercussions, and I try to prepare myself for what's to come. I accept my fate to vanish from this program. I had my chance, and yet I couldn't even finish the job!",
            "The Chosen drags me out from beneath the carriage with his gloved hands. A long streak of the husband's blood stains my bangs and trickles down my nose. When I look to the inside of the white carriage, emptied of its crying inhabitants and bright with a splatter of red, I find the husband taking shallow breaths as he holds his shoulder, tended to by the glowing hands of their family's hired healer.",
            "The immaculately-dressed wife's jewelry clatters when she gets her hands around my collar, thrashing me as the Chosen hesitates to disarm his source of wealth. Her hands are already red with her lover's blood, clothes absent the pristine ivory white they surely struggled to sustain on such sultry trails.",
            "\"You cowering, yellow-bellied bitch,\" she exclaims. Her gloved hand batters my cheek with deafening leather contact. \"You leach our tribute. You live to give your lives for us, and I'll be sure you don't see another sunrise in this line of work. The guard of this backwater town are a joke!\"",
            "I can feel my tears streaming, directly in the view of all my comrades that can only just stand there and watch. Jullian ducks his head when I meet his eyes. Naya freezes, her tail frayed. And Ryder and Pax are busy wrestling the Chymaeran as it tries to change forms. ",
            "But I hear the husband. \"Dear. That young guard is the reason my head is on my shoulders. I mean, Gods, if she hadn't given the horses a start...\"",
            "\"She nearly got you killed!\"",
            "\"The bullet did that,\" he says.",
            "\"But still,\" she says. The mercurial woman releases my collar and tensions her fists, letting out an exasperated cry. The side of my face aches as I slouch, wiping my tears with the unsullied parts of my arms, remembering not to dirty their carriage with contact from my body.",
            "But it's the distress of the children that damages me the most. Standing on the other side of their life-altering trauma, facing such failure that I'm painted with the aggressor, the devastating shock registers on their faces, now devoid of sorrow, just speechless like I once was as they try to recalibrate their understanding of how horrifying the world can be. And all I want is to embrace them, to tell them that everything will be alright, to let them cry into my shoulder.",
            "\"You failed us. And you're going to pay for this,\" the wife screams at Aldrin when he approaches. \"How are you going to make this right?\"",
            "\"You'll make it right by apologizing to my officer,\" he says. \"I don't care how much money you have, what role you play in the Empire, you will apologize for assaulting the woman who tried to save you!\"",
            "\"And failed,\" she insists. \"You're messing with Valensend blood—\"",
            "\"You gave two days of warning for your arrival, refusing like all you rich types do to pay in advance, and then you have the gall to say we didn't prepare. It takes weeks!\"",
            "The woman tensions her fists. Two of children grasp her dress by the fabric. I draw deep breaths to make the blood flow back into my fingers and legs, all the while feeling like I'm stealing a resource I no longer deserve.",
            "But I hear the father's voice behind me. \"She would have complained the same if it was just a scare: I would have stopped her if I had the strength. As far as I'm concerned, you saved my life.\"",
            "\"But I hesitated. I saved no one. It was luck.\"",
            "\"Luck or not, you're a reason my children still have a father,\" he says. I turn around. He gestures for the servant and the healer to tend to my scratches, and with a quick wave of a hand, I feel the sting slowly dissipate from my face.",
            "He reaches from the open door, dabbing his blood from my skin with a clean corner of a towel, ensuring that nothing ill will come of this. Behind us, the two continue to argue as senior guards apprehend the battered Chymaeran assassin. It's only when I see the assailant's guise of my cherished friend that I remember the absence of the real one.",
            "I release an unintelligible string of words before the panic peaks inside me once again. Aldrin shouts. Two of my friends try to stop me, and the woman screams of my cowardice, but all I can think of is what I learned it takes for a Chymaeran to steal a guise.",
            "I run as fast as my feet will take me, choosing to try and save another, even if it means damnation for leaving this all behind."

            "I can only work as fast as the computer will take me, choosing to try and save the file every chance I get. I've spent so many hours imagining how I would boost the performance if IT gave me a blank check, and I was the bottleneck. Although a workstation laptop is nice to take home, it has nothing over one of those stationary rigs that the Robinson-Monroe lifers were grandfathered into.",
            "They gave me the laptop two years ago, and it hasn't been updated since. One day I booted into BIOS to see if I could overclock it, or take it to its limits. But IT's Great Wall of Control knows no bounds, so all I can do is sit here for twenty minutes at a time before I notice the changes in the drawing are applied.",
            "Those twenty minutes are silent. Only Wilbur and I sit in the row, and we're not even across from each other. Reed filled in the spot that the last escapee left behind, and although I was eager for months to move next to Kei and take the next steps, Navesh insisted it was a \"major waste of time.\" I feel like Wilbur and I have exhausted every topic across the generational gap: his kids, when I plan to marry, if I have a serious girlfriend yet, cars, and sports. Every day I hear his wake apnea over the partitions, and sometimes I wonder if it's the perfect cover for him to be sleeping.",
            "The computer still holds an hourglass. It's midday, and the neighboring row is filled with chatter. I hear Reed's voice the most often, and a little too often: if golden retrievers could design and code, and the connotation didn't imply he was stupid, I think it would fit him well. Kei acknowledges his musings here and there, but is always so focused that she spits no more than a couple words.",
            "I check the calendar in the lower right corner of my screen. Fall is fast approaching, and when I count, it's been almost four weeks since I moved in. Four weekends of my parents coming over to visit, bringing over one of my favorite home-cooked meals, allowing them to ask when they'll have grandkids now that I have a house. Four weeks since I lost my brother's classic IPod, so now I listen to music on my phone. But also four weeks without drinking: most days I just go home, spend an hour on the computer scrolling my list of games, trying to convince myself to play something, and then go to sleep early unless I go to the gym with Miguel.",
            "Reed keeps rambling on about sports and hobbies, and the more I just sit there — helpless to walk over or else I'll look lonely and desperate — the more I wonder if I'm getting the right dose of meds. The longer time drags, and the later into my twenties it gets, the further I feel from the spurious passion of those college years where it was forced out of me. It's like being at the bottom of a dark pool, or a distant game of telephone recalling how I last recalled those moments. My vocal cords feel neglected for how little use they get, and like an unmotivated violinist, I've been unpracticed for a while.",
            "The render loads. It breaks the entire assembly, and I have another three keystrokes before I wait even longer.",
            "\"Hey, Reed. Good job on the redline today,\" Nav says. \"I hope you've been getting used to the software?\"",
            "\"Of course,\" he says. \"Kei has been teaching me well. And Cody over there, too.\"",
            "I count the green-stamped pages on my desk. Three I've completed today. Maybe they just forget I work here?",
            "\"So anyways. I want the three junior engineers to follow me,\" Nav says. I duck my head to look busy when he comes over. \"Cody, can you follow us?\"",
            "\"Sure, Nav,\" I tell him.",
            "We gather in one of the small meeting rooms. I sit first near the door, then Kei and Reed sit together on the far side. Nav makes small talk when he's plugging in his laptop. \"I haven't seen you at any of the happy hours, Cody,\" he says. \"The whole team was there last week: what have you been so busy with?\"",
            "\"I even got Kei to go once,\" Reed says. \"And she's usually busy all the time!\"",
            "Kei smiles. \"Yeah, I guess I can admit last week was a little fun. Even if it's just talking about guy stuff at a sports bar.\"",
            "Reed looks at me earnestly. I can tell that he means it. \"You should come.\" He reminds me of my business major roommates in college, except before I had a legitimate excuse.",
            "\"Yeah. Sounds like fun.\"",
            "\"Well, tonight's the night. We were thinking Chili's,\" Nav says. \"And you all have been doing great, so I thought I'd buy you all a drink.\"",
            "\"Cheers to that!\" Reed exclaims, raising an imaginary glass as I take a long draw of an energy drink. Nav flicks on the projector. His screen comes into focus, with a presentation labeled INTERMITTENT APPRENTICE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, BY NAVESH D. PRATEL.",
            "\"So I've been looking for ways to keep us busy. Things have been rather slow, and with Scott leaving and all —\"",
            "\"Scott's leaving?\" We say in near unison.",
            "\"Yeah. Oh, shoot — I was supposed to wait until Monday, gosh darn it,\" he says. \"Keep this between us.\"",
            "\"And what's going to happen?\" Kei asks.",
            "\"I don't know, with the hiring freeze and all, maybe something will come from within,\" Nav says. He winks so hard I think I hear it. \"Anyways, on an unrelated note, I have a project to keep you guys busy, instead of vanishing early to go to Starbucks.\"",
            "\"Awesome,\" Reed says, but literally.",
            "\"We spend forever just designing and redesigning what already exists. It's what most of engineering is if you're not R and D, after all.\" ",
            "Next slide.",
            "A 90's clip-art image of batteries is on the screen, each with little faces, shaking hands like little powered businessmen. I nearly laugh and I have to cover my mouth.",
            "\"You spend so much time doing redlines as support engineers that you don't get to feel what it's like to come up with something. Surely you felt it in college. Maybe you've missed it.\"",
            "I nod almost as excitedly as Reed does.",
            "\"Enclosures, and more enclosures. Modifying dimensions of existing batteries by the smallest hair to please a customer's plans. Well, I want you all to take a shot at designing something entirely new,\" Nav says. \"You should know how batteries work from experience, not just designing the stuff they're housed in.\"",
            "\"Yes, a million times yes,\" Reed says, and even Kei looks slightly invested.",
            "The next slide is a cross-section of a battery scanned from one of the lifers' textbooks, with such hand-drawn beauty there's no doubt it came from the seventies. I relish that it's finally something I'm good at, involving all the robotics I love to do in my garage.",
            "\"What happens is a redox reaction, or reduction-oxidation,\" Nav says, sounding like my Circuits professor if he was twenty years older. \"The anode has electron-rich elements like zinc, so it's negative. The cathode has elements like silver, so it's positive, and when you connect a wire from one to the other, you get electron flow.\"",
            "Next slide.",
            "\"We typically do nickel-cadmium or lithium-ion, far better than the lead-acid ones. Then there's nickel-metal-hydride . . .\" ",
            "He drones on and on. With the energy drink death-gripped in my hand, I manage to stay awake: Reed can do it without anything. I decide to just wait for the email with the PowerPoint.",
            "\"And, with all these considerations, your task will be to design an optimal battery, given a set volume. You'll do some theory, then we'll use the multimillion-dollar battery lab the R&D guys seem to have forgotten about.\"",
            "\"That's great,\" Reed says.",
            "\"How far you go with this project is up to you, and what you take from it is very important. You'll be doing this between redlines, getting feedback from Senior engineers, so that you design the best battery possible, and safely,\" he says, closing his laptop. \"We'll be starting next week. And since it's Friday, maybe we can talk about it at Happy Hour.\"",
            "We all stand from the table. My foot falls asleep pretzeled on my other leg, so I stumble towards the door last. But before I can exit, Reed stops me."

            "\"I don't know. The kind of stuff we used to do. But before, before...\"",
            "Before that last summer before you left, I think. That was just Student Government stuff late in the evenings. Late work like this. I remember the last day of my junior year and her senior year, cleaning the room one last time as the Presidential cabinet, when I felt my heart swell in my chest with the apprehension of whether I was going to make my move. Time was running out. I had waited all year. The door was closed, and when she turned around, I pressed my lips to hers, and she dissolved into me, starting that perfect summer before she went—",
            "\"Cody? I said we could do dinner.\" I was staring at her lips the whole time. It's a miracle I didn't raise half a chub, thanks to the waistband trick. \"I'll shoot you a text,\" she offers, just as Reed sends another message in our group chat. All I can think of is how we left it last: letting the chance of starting anew decay over four years of college. It never had a title, but the split was worse than any other relationship I've been in.",
            "My mind is abuzz on the car ride home, so distracted the dark dissolves my sight of the exit gate, and I nearly ram it. I should be happy, but I feel some kind of sadness overtake me, and by the third light, I can feel my eyes well with tears. Maybe it's how fast the four weeks since moving in have gone. Maybe it's this unstructured emptiness into which my life retreats. Like Newton said about forces and stuff in motion, I feel like if nothing else ever acted on me, I'd float in this job at this level and at this social vapidness until I hit the mahogany wood of my coffin.",
            "I don't know how Reed or my late brother Jackie seem to find it. That energy to reach beyond, and every time I reach the end of this line of thinking, I wish it was the one lesson my older brother could have passed down to me."

            "\"I know,\" Ryder says. \"I checked the Chymaeran's things. He didn't have a Guise Marker on him, so he didn't have the time to sever a finger. You know it takes a while to process.\"",

            "\"Fine. But the guise isn't active anymore,\" I tell them, as we begin to run at even pace. \"He has no need to be alive.\"",
            "We pass the market street, then sprint along the road at the edge of the lake. I collect speed with distance, and by the time we arrive at Bertram's gate, I leverage all my Essence and anger against his door, bashing my armored shoulder against the painted wood.",
            "The door splits in splintered halves. The dust and sawdust coalesce in dark, floating motes as the sun casts ribbons of light through the entryway, and I squint my eyes to adjust to the darkness of his house. There is not a sound to tell his whereabouts. We enter the kitchen to find the window ajar with the curtains fluttering, the same window I use to trade for breakfast.",
            "\"He's not on the bottom floor,\" I say. It's just a single, long room that mixes the kitchen with a living space and dining area. None of the chairs are overturned, and the mess looks average for a single man.",
            "We begin to climb the stairs. Pax insists on going first, followed by Ryder, followed by me, with my dagger drawn hilt-up. They know the hallway design is two rooms and a master, so they split off to take the other rooms, leaving me with the only place my friend can feasibly lie.",
            "We throw the doors open at the same time. I hear no commotion from the other two, and as I approach the bed, I see the sheets are clean, crumpled with a pallid figure sweating in short trousers.",
            "\"Bertram,\" I say. ",
            "He's breathing heavily, still unable to move, and veins of amethyst metastasize in a rash across his skin.",
            "\"Clear,\" the others report, entering the bedroom to find me kneeling beside his bed.",
            "\"How bad is it? Do you know?\" I ask Pax. \"He's breathing, and he's not bleeding, what did they do to him?\"",
            "Pax presses his fingers to Bertram's neck. The room gets colder as his fingertips flush with obsidian. \"The guise is up, so he's not being drained any longer, but he'a really on the edge.\"",
            "\"Drained?\" I ask.",
            "\"The blood,\" Pax says. \"For a short guise like this that doesn't take a pound of flesh, it evaporates from his body every minute, damaging his organs. He'll wish he lost a finger instead.\"",
            "\"We need to heal him right away,\" I say, extending my hands, but Pax stops me.",
            "\"Human Essence will only make this worse. It's like treating frostburn with warm water.\"",
            "\"Then what do we do?\" I ask.",
            "\"There's medicine at the base, but it's really up to him until we can get him there. He's got to fight,\" Pax says. \"The worst is over, but I only know l as far as experimenting with my Chymaeran blood has gotten me. I'll still monitor the Curse.\"",
            "\"And I'll carry him,\" Ryder says.",
            "\"We need to keep him warm,\" I say. He's sweating so profusely, but I tuck the sheets around him, feeling his flesh is colder than ice. I press my head to his chest, listening to his faint heartbeat. \"It's my turn to save you,\" I tell him, standing back as Ryder works to position him across the back of his shoulders.",
            "Beyond his window, the curious villagers and guards begin to gather, and I pray that Aldrin will have the understanding. I follow Pax and Ryder to the gates of the base on the route of our daily walk, using Essence to help sustain his warmth beneath the blanket."

            "It's the fact that the last four weeks passed so peacefully. I thought this was all just a dream after that drunken night with Miguel, but the beautiful girl I mistook for a cosplayer chokes on her tears between breaths as she buries her face into my arm.",
            "\"They've all abandoned me,\" she says. \"I failed to . . . he almost died, because . . .\" My fingers trace her back until I realize I'm just touching her armor (and it's doing nothing for her). I gently guide her back against the couch. For every extra breath of air she finds, she shells it out in useless ramblings that drive her further into a panic, tensioning her body inwards as the tears flow from her face.",
            "She tensions her hands  around my arm so strongly that the blood starts seizing in my own limb. ",
            "\"Save your breath,\" I tell her. \"You have to breathe. Whatever happened has passed, and it's over now. You're safe here.\"",
            "\"But the town—\"",
            "\"The town is fine,\" I tell her, uncertain of what delusion could cause such a visceral reaction. It was all a fever dream, right? I remember getting sliced across the palm, but I woke up without a scratch. The girl's my neighbor: just a whacked-out cosplayer. Maybe someone reported her stream to the IRS for tax evasion?",
            "She finds more words as her trembling subsides. \"I only came here because . . . I had no other choice, and as much as I wish I never had to see you again . . .\"",

The kitchen knives she threw at my head. \"Not that much, I mean.\" And then I remember the gash she sliced in my championship lacrosse stick that got me from freshman benchwarmer to Varsity senior. \"I'm just afraid of you. And—and you piss me off a little, but not that much,\" I say, trying to balance the resurgent feelings of vice with a desire for goodwill.",
            "Her stress slides further from panic into sorrow, exchanging less heaving breaths for more tears. She's dressed entirely in her custom light armor: I'd think she'd only need it above the torso to film a Let's Play in character, but she's committed to the part.",
            "\"Hey. Let's get that armor off of you,\" I tell her. She reaches for the faux-leather straps on the sides, and when I grab the shoulder pads, I find them oddly cold to the touch.",
            "I try lifting as she lifts her arms, but it's pretty heavy for light armor. The fabric feels hand-woven, with the smallest imperfections that tell of old-world craftsmanship. It smells of sweat and manual labor. And as I struggle to pull it off her body, I notice the contours of the breastplate are caught on something beneath.",

            "\"You got this made of actual metal? Cast iron?\"",
            "\"What else would stop an arrow?\" She asks, holding her breath as I tug harder. Once she finds enough breath to go without it, she exhales completely, and in an instant, I lose my balance and trip over one of the unpacked boxes from four weeks ago.",
            "The entire weight of the armored torso lands on my face when I crash to the floor. My hands cup the meager metal chest contours of modified men's armor, weighing against my face and smelling of sweat as if I were stuck in a scrum of lacrosse players.",
            "But I can hear her breathe easier without the burden of all that cosplay gear. Her breathless panic makes even more sense when I rid my face of the breastplate, discovering how much she has to contort herself just to fit into the damn thing.",
            "She removes the last of her bindings, far tighter than the \"combat corset\" that constrains her waist. She pulls at the fabric of the undershirt to circulate air, where two large sweat spots accentuate the shape of her chest.",
            "Her face and golden eyes alone could get a zoomer to watch her stream Excel spreadsheets: if she ditched the immersive armor and went for something less practical, she could be living in a mansion!",
            "I open my mouth to try to distill that compliment into something platonic, but stop when I see the state of her. Her disheveled hair is frayed far past the braid I first saw her with. Crescents dig beneath her eyes, and as she still works at slowing her breaths — muttering to herself something about \"where she is\" — I can see how tired this whole ordeal has made her, and my feelings of malice slip away.",
            "She sits with her head in her hands, tensioning her fingers around her scalp. I'd offer her a hug if I didn't think she still hated me, so instead, I decide to warm her with something else.",
            "I approach the kitchen, starting the coffee maker to make some hot chocolate my mom left from the old house. I watch her golden eyes peer over the edge of the couch when the heating element starts boiling the water, like my parents' cat when the refrigerator makes ice.",

            "She tilts her head. \"What is it doing?\"",
            "\"Boiling water?\" I answer.",
            "\"Huh.\" She leans higher, watching the flickering blue LED light with a genuine sense of bewilderment. \"So you do have Essence. Why didn't you use it?\"",
            "\"Essence?\" I ask.",
            "\"Essence. To run the mechanism: top off the Essence capacitor. Like a stove, or a fan, or...\"",
            "\"It runs on electricity.\"",
            "\"Electricity?\" She asks. \"What a waste. How do you have that much power? And how rich are you to have all this,\" she gestures around the living room, \"stuff?\"",
            "She still finds the strength to do her bit, despite whatever wore on her. \"I bought most of it at Home Goods and that corner part of Ross without the clothes. I'm far from rich when I have a mortgage hanging over my head now,\" I tell her.",
            "\"You must make a lot of Kine off your inventions.\"",
            "\"Not yet. I get paid to modify other people's stuff,\" I tell her. My hands reach into the cabinet, finding the old matching mugs Kei and I bought for the Student Government club room. I hesitate over which one to grab, then after the coffee maker pings, I grab my own.",
            "The old coffee maker dispenses the succulent store-bought chocolate into the mug, rising with steam as dots of moisture condense on the blue inner walls of the porcelain. But it doesn't feel very warm.",
            "\"Oh. It's a drink,\" she says.",
            "I look at her, puzzled, until she gestures to bring it over.",
            "\"It's an old coffee maker from my parents' house. They got a new Keurig, so they let me have the old one — the model before it scanned the damn pods to make sure you're buying theirs. Heating element isn't great, so hopefully it's not like drinking chocolate milk.\"",
            "\"Not a problem,\" she says, taking the cup into her hands. I notice a faint glow emanate from beneath the cup as the air warms around her, and in seconds, the cup is steaming again.",
            "It's my turn for bewilderment. She catches my expression with a tired glance. ",
            "\"What?\"",
            "\"How did you...?\"",
            "I bend to look beneath the mug, but there's nothing there. Once I realize it looks like I'm staring directly at her breasts, I bend upright.",
            "\"What kind of an uncultured bumpkin are you?\" She asks. \"Life and fire. Humans. You. Me,\" she says, raising her right hand to pretend she's bending fire.",
            "Pretending, right?",
            "I feel the heat first. And then at a point an inch above her palm, a spark transitions into a raging plume of controlled fire, casting the walls in flickering light.",
            "I instinctively reach to see if it's a hologram. I feel burning heat before she ceases, slapping my hand away.",
            "\"You grab for fire like you grabbed for that dagger,\" she says. \"Pray tell, what kind of stupid idiot savant are you?\"",
            "I stammer over my words. My mind races through every physics and thermodynamics textbook I've ever skimmed for problem sets, and can't find any explanation. The sudden wave of confusion is so strong that I sit down on the box I tripped on moments earlier. \"Sweet Carnot,\" I say.",
            "\"Is that one of your gods?\" ",
            "\"If you design cars and airplanes,\" I say. \"What the fuck?\" And then I gesture to her. \"Do it again. How did you do that?\"",
            "I'm too damn tired, she says.",
            "\"Do it,\" I insist, like a child at a birthday magic show.",

            "\"This is really good,\" she says. \"What is it?\"",
            "\"Hot chocolate. From the grocery store. But really, though. How did you—\"",
            "She takes another loud sip. \"I usually hate sweet stuff. But this is nice.\" She warms it further with her hands: the mug glows with conductive heat, and then she drinks all the rest of it in a single swallow.",
            "Now I have my head in my hands, unsure whether I really want to know the secret behind her sleight-of-hand.",
            "\"You really have never seen this before? Even a child can make a spark,\" she insists, reclining back into the couch as her eyes feather on the edge of exhausted sleep.",
            "\"I'm not a damn child,\" I tell her. \"It's not real. You can't just...\" but then I realize she's fading away on the couch: it must be comfortable if it makes Miguel fade away this easily, too.",
            "I take the mug by the handle and rinse it in the sink. The red-hot bottom evaporates the first volume of water to steam before it normalizes, and I flip it upside-down into the dish organizer, since I haven't run the dishwasher in a week and I can't remember if it's all dirty or not. On the bottom, I inspect the words I wrote almost a decade earlier.",

            "I don't hear it. ",

            "I look at the laughable spread of blankets and bedsheets again, more concerned about the duress I put him under. \"You could have let go. I mean, you don't even know me. Why didn't you force my hand away and get a good night of sleep?\"",
            "His voice quiets on a hint of humiliation. \"Well, you know, you were crying and all. Said not to leave, again and again, and your grip is pretty strong, so...\"",
            "\"So you didn't leave,\" I say. Something makes me want to tear up again when a strange sense of relief approaches, but I'm done being weak and sentimental. \"Well, thank you.\"",
            "\"Sure. But you can do me a favor and take a shower?\" he asks.",
            "\"Excuse me?\" I ask.",
            "\"It smells like you haven't showered in a week,\" he says.",
            "\"I can't afford a shower,\" I tell him. \"I went in the lake last week, then took a bath, like, four days ago.\"",
            "\"Really? You can afford to shower. It's not like the drought three years ago.\"",
            "\"Can't afford A SHOWER,\" I clarify, gathering my things like a mistress of the night.",
            "\"It comes with the damn unit!\" Cody exclaims. \"How could you possibly not have a shower? There were only two options in the builder's package. Either Mantequilla, or—\"",
            "\"Wait,\" I say, putting my hand to his mouth. A shadow approaches the door of his house that's so immaculate and messy at the same time. \"Did you hear that?\"",
            "\"Probably just the delivery driver,\" I say.",
            "\"That's not a knocker.\" I reach for the knife I kept hidden in the side holster of my breastplate, ready to pounce as soon as the adversary blasts open the door. Cody is too weak to defend himself.",
            "\"Yo, chill! Chill out. Look,\" he says, showing me a brightly-lit device with far more little colored squares than the music box. A cartoon of an automobile is on the screen, dancing around the center of a map. \"You don't have to stab first and ask questions later, soldier girl.\"",
            "\"And you don't have to grab fire and blades, foolish boy,\" I respond.",
            "He cracks the door. I rise to my feet and find the footing to attack, but when the door opens, some bearded guy with earrings and fancy glasses hands a bag to him. Cody mutters some question about whether the tip of something is in an app, and then he nods, allowing him to close the door, and when I catch a glimpse of the scene beyond the door, I realize again that it looks nothing like Gaffesend.",
            "I rush to the window, throwing open the shades. \"Where is this? Where are you? And where's the lake?\" I ask. I begin to think it's all a ruse to trap me at my weakest.",
            "\"A couple blocks down. You think I could afford lakeside in this economy?\" He asks. \"But the walk is nice.\"",
            "Before he can hand me something from the bag, I race back across the threshold of my door, only to find my world the same way I left it. From my window, Gaffesend is abuzz with the week's end sight of commoners strolling on the cobblestone streets.",
            "\"Katiya,\" Cody calls. \"Do you want your tacos or not?\"",
            "\"Cody,\" I say. \"This is...\"",
            "He crosses the threshold of the door, finding the same sight he must have thought was just a dream. Now he rushes to my window, watching the water reflect in the light of an early-morning sun.",
            "I'm glad he put the bag down in the other world. He clutches his chest, short of breath, and I think the man of science is finally beginning to understand that the world is not as measurable as he thinks.",
            "His face flushes white as if he's seen a Chymaeran fleshwalker. I have to catch him before he falls, and I grab him by the space between his arms.",
            "\"You weren't — you mean that—\" Cody tries to struggle from my grasp to walk out my front door for the first time by his own volition, but his clothes are far too strange: they might think he's a Chymaeran spy, or ask his noble heritage.",
            "\"Stop resisting,\" I command, hugging him to my chest. I realize I'm speaking my own tongue now, and he's speaking mine, and I say, \"seriously, can you stop fighting me when I'm trying to help you?\"",
            "\"Do it again,\" he says, slumping in dead weight before he collects himself, rising to his feet half a head taller than me. \"Do the fire trick again.\"",
            "I roll my eyes. \"It's not a trick, Cody.\"",
            "\"Do it,\" he says, then adds, \"please,\" staring at me with his dark brown eyes.",
            "I light a simple flame. He looks on with such stupid, childlike captivation that I wonder what other dumb banality could capture his attention.",
            "\"Holy shit,\" he says. \"And how do you do that?\"",
            "\"Watch this,\" I say. ",
            "I direct the energy to form a loop of flame, spinning around my palm. And some of the other stupid tricks the cadets used to come up with. \"So can we eat now?\"",
            "\"I guess it will never get cold,\" he says.",
            "\"So you live your whole life without Essence?\" I ask him. \"So you're some kind of purist monk?\"",
            "He responds in my tongue again without noticing he's doing it. \"No Essence at all. Just electricity: there's no magic in our world.\"",
            "\"But what about the cars?\" I ask.",
            "\"A four-stroke engine that runs on dead dinosaurs.\" I don't catch the meaning of the last word, but my mind associates it with creatures from an eternity ago. He clarifies. \"Gasoline. Hydrocarbons from crude oil.\"",
            "\"It's as if the world wasn't made for you. As if your world never had the blessings of the Gods.\"",
            "\"We don't know if there is a god, beyond money and power,\" Cody says. \"They certainly haven't introduced themselves in person.\"",
            "\"Well, let's eat,\" I insist. \"Before it gets cold, or before I have to warm it up again.\""

That you have to rotate the thing sideways to put it in your mouth to take a bite, but Katiya wedged her teeth between the middle of the shell, taking bites like a chipmunk as she complained that the shell might spill it all.",
            "Nor did I ever consider how the taste of processed food might be too much for someone that eats an antiquated diet of fruit and bread and meat, taken aback by how salted the ground beef was, though she liked gnashing her teeth on the crunch of the shell when she finally figured out that she had to turn her head.",
            "I let her stop there, hiding the soda I got for her in the fridge in fear that the carbonation might make it shoot out of her nose.",

And then I add, \"Maybe if your world could come up with half this shit instead of relying on Essence, you'd be able to buy a shower instead of using mine,\" I tell her. \"Maybe that's the first rule.\" I reach for an actual pen in one of the boxes. \"Don't ever get too comfortable with the other world's stuff, though that's probably more for you, right?\"",

She adds one about being in her world dressed as strangely as I am now, and I counter with a corollary saying she can't dress like an e-girl unless it's Halloween or the Renaissance Faire. She says not to go out in Gaffesend without her. I say she doesn't have a license, so she shouldn't go out in my world either.",

            "\"Like hang out?\" I ask.",

            "He spends a near ten minutes trying to find twenty different ways to demand that I sit in the exact same place without touching anything. That I'm safe. That I can't possibly get hurt, regardless of how fast we go. That anything foreign and strange and big and too impossibly smooth is there for a reason, and that nothing is going wrong unless he says it is, and that he'll surely bring it up if things are even slightly bad.",
            "He doesn't press the glowing switch on the wall for a reason, facing the large metal door that looks like it isn't supposed to open from the sides. The automobile is so smooth and metallic: shinier than my greatsword, and probably one of the shiny things he told me not to touch.",
            "But he instructs me to enter. Then he looks down at my feet and realizes I'm wearing steel boots, and demands more of me, telling me to lace up a pair of his \"trainers\" though they look nothing like shoes of war.",
            "And once my feet fill the space like two parishioners in a grand chapel to the Gods, he tells me to GENTLY! pull the handle, afraid of my strength.",
            "I sit in the car on the comfortable seat, wondering why everything is so soft in this world that you could fall asleep on it: even the people, from the kind of food Cody's shown me so far. And then he presses a button on a wide mirror that opens the door to this car room: sounding off with a loud rumble of a generator that nearly sets me into panic.",
            "He reassures me that it's all okay. But then something flashes on his automobile's front thing about blue teeth being connected, and I hear the loudest sound I've ever heard: one that gives me such a start that I notice it gives him a start, and according to his original rules, that means that I should panic.",
            "His hand slams against the circular knob as I almost drive my fist against the glowing screen, but he deflects my hand just in time. He wags his finger several times at me before pulling out his cellular telephone to change something, saying that music about metal is probably too much for me, that he was just at the gym.",
            "I ask him what they're yelling about. He says he doesn't really know, but that it gets him \"amped\" at the gymnasium, and chooses some other thing that tells the sonograph to play another tune.",
            "He backs out of the space slowly. His eyes flicker between my face and the edge of the car port that's close to the metal door, and I nearly slam my head against the front with the sudden change in inertia.",
            "He presses his left arm against my shoulders, telling me to relax. And when he's beginning to second-guess himself of this whole plan, saying that he's only \"adding fuel to the fire that is my anxiety,\" and that I'm never going to relax at this rate.",
            "I tell him I'm not made to relax, and that I've faced worse than his soft world with all these rounded edges could ever throw at him.",
            "So we back out of the driveway. I tense my legs and feet against the bottom of the car to make sure my back is always against the soft chair, and when he makes his first full quarter-turn backwards into the street, something closes the big steel door.",
            "He asks if I'm alright. I ask if he's going to stop asking if I'm alright, and when my eyes look up from my legs to take in the view beyond the warped front glass, I see a marvel of architecture in front of my eyes.",
            "It's like the town of Gaffesend with all its row-houses, but cleaner and sharper. There are children here that play in the street: the young ones at least, the older ones sit in the corners on telephones like the one that Cody has, laughing at something as they share it with each other. One man sprays a dedicated stream of water from a hose to wet his plants. There are so many other cars that sit all across the road: behind the car garages, on the streets off to the side, so many that I wonder if they have cars this comfortable, why they would need a house in the first place. ",
            "I wonder aloud. It makes Cody laugh pretty hard, and he manages to collect himself by the first red octagon with the words STOP written across it.",
            "I don't allow the inertia to surprise me this time. But the right turn does, and I lean so far into Cody that I have to stabilize myself by grabbing his right leg, causing him to slam the brake and throw himself forward.",
            "He barks at me, but without bite, gesturing to a handle attached to the top edge of the car, something he calls the \"oh-shit handle,\" insisting I grab it until I get my bearing. Several seconds later, he changes his mind and tells me not to, afraid I might rip it off the roof.",
            "But I'm too amazed by the sights to tense my body for any turns. When the view of houses opens up after a couple turns, and the musical automobile climbs a slight hill, I catch a fuller view of the city: spanning so far that my eyes can't count the number of buildings. Not a single stretch of farmland is anywhere: just buildings erected from the colors of nature around them; shiny points of light that shimmer in the mountains; large balloons of color with people in them that hover above the lake.",
            "\"And none of this is Essence,\" I ask. ",
            "And Cody nods with ease.",
            "My mind doesn't even know what to process from what my eyes observe, like the late-night lectures in school when all the cadets are too tired to retain anything. My chest stirs with an animated lightness unlike anything I think I've ever felt before, except maybe when I was a young child, and although it scares me — and it's probably a little from Cody as the operator — I feel an odd calmness when I'm next to him, listening to the faint voice he tries to hide when he sings the words to the songs he likes.",
            "The cabin is pleasantly cool despite how hot it might be out there. He gestures to a part of the car that shows a number that resembles the temperature, instead of a thermometer.",
            "I bring my head close to the air conditioning. He asks if I really want to have my hair blown, and lowers the window, filling the space with a deafening gust of air until he lowers his window, telling me to reach my hand beyond the cabin.",
            "We race so fast that the air floods through my fingers like water in a stream, and I realize I'm laughing, but I don't stop myself too much. We get on the highway, and though he's apprehensive of whether I'll try to slice the seat belt and jump out the window, I find it amazing: thrilling that any person could have such an ease of access to the sensation of speed.",
            "There are so many other people of this world inside these cars that I wave at them, but Cody tells me not to. He then demands that I \"don't speak to anyone yet\" and \"don't call anything anything to anyone\" and to \"mask my surprise a little\" when we get to our destination.",
            "We get off the highway and end up on slower and smaller roads for a while, stopping at crossroads where some light operator tells us when we can drive. One fellow blares his horn really loud, enough to anger Cody to use some gesture on him, speaking words I can't yet fully understand, but he calms down when he remembers that I'm here, saying he \"forgot that I could smite them.\"",
            "We end up on a wide square of painted lines in organized rows. Cody stops the automobile between two pairs of them, between two other cars, and instructs me to CAREFULLY! open the car door and not touch the other car door next to me.",
            "I step out into the space between cars, my stomach a little twisted, but my body feeling light. He gestures to a big building with a word that doesn't translate, because he says it's a company called Costco, and that they have more stuff to eat and wear and buy than I could ever imagine.",
            "I can feel a hint of the panic set in when I realize I'm surrounded by other commoners of his world for the first time. I'd retreat back into the car if Cody didn't coax me out by gently grabbing my shirt, telling me that if I stick with him, I'll be fine.",
            "He offers his hand to me, and I hesitate. But right when I'm about to take it, he pulls away, apologizing, saying that I can walk right next to him.",
            "He points to a row of metal baskets, telling me to grab one. I lift it by the side. His face flushes in secondhand embarrassment when he shows me that there are wheels on the bottom for a reason, and though the wheels are halfway to my waist, I drop the cart as people stare.",
            "He says it's fine, drawing into his pockets for a small card with patterned lines on it, saying something about hot dogs and some guy that raises them for cheap, instructing me to push the cart as we enter the big warehouse, making sure that I don't make eye contact with anyone."

            "\"Just humans,\" Cody says. \"So boring and dissimilar we call different skin colors different races, can you believe that?\"",
            "\"No,\" I tell him, pushing the cart by its wheels instead of lifting it by the side.",
            "The store is so flooded with people that it reminds me of my late childhood in the capital. But it seems that all the vendors are owned by the same people — the dog guy that Cody was talking about.",
            "I spot three exits to the building in case anything happens, Cody tugs the cart past the massive screens, showcasing views of other worlds so real you can't even see the tiny little dots of color, and I begin to wonder whether it's a doorway like the one between our homes.",
            "But Cody reads my mind. \"Not a portal,\" he says. \"Those are televisions.\"",
            "\"Where do they go?\" I ask. \"I thought you had to project the pictures from a box.\"",
            "\"Nowhere. You'd probably get electrocuted if you stuck your head in there,\" he says.",
            "He goads me onward, passing an array of smaller screens in the telephone format that Cody has, called Smartphones, filled with so much knowledge it's like the Verdala and their network of wisdom trees.",
            "I try not making eye contact, but it's unfathomable to see a crowd of people without a single cat-eared Ahkvasan or mixed-race person. And to think they all have no Essence at all: something that terrifies me if I imagine they were invaded.",
            "I try to spin up some conversation instead of asking Cody foolish questions. \"Say, who is that girl that you admire?\"",
            "\"Which one?\"",
            "\"The mug girl,\" I say. \"From work.\"",
            "He laughs. \"Mug girl. You mean Kei?\"",
            "\"Yeah, Kei,\" I say. \"How are things with her?\"",
            "His grasp tightens around the mesh of the cart as I push it. \"I don't know. I'm not really sure,\" he says. \"We used to be really close: we kissed, even. Things were getting good, then she left for college because she was a year ahead of me.\"",
            "I ask, \"Did you have intercourse with this woman?\"",
            "Cody convulses, grabbing my shoulder before he realizes we're alone in the aisle. He sighs. \"Katiya. You can't just talk about that out loud,\" he says.",
            "\"Why not?\" I ask.",
            "\"Because people aren't always that open to talking about stuff like that.\"",
            "\"Why should we care?\" I ask, sincerely.",
            "\"Because it's etiquette. Sex, drugs, stuff like that, makes people uncomfortable, so it's better to talk in private.\"",
            "\"Then how does anyone have . . . that level of engagement in your society?\"",
            "\"It's on the phone now,\" he whispers. \"You wouldn't just walk up to someone and ask for it, would you?\"",
            "\"Well, in the poor parts of Northaven, when—\"",
            "\"—Don't answer that,\" he says, taking the cart over from me.",
            "\"So this girl,\" I start. \"The one you didn't have,\" and I almost laugh, \"business with.\"",
            "He sneers at me. \"Yeah. We were too young for that, kind of. And then college was busy — sleeping around and stuff without anything real, and now the stupid, boring, lonely, real world you're thrust into after all that, when you have to pay off the student loan and become indebted to a piece of land.\"",
            "\"But how could you ever be bored or lonely? Bored of this?\" She lifts a kids' drawing kit, and then a card with a Nintendo Switch depicted on it. \"And how could you be lonely when you're literally connected to everyone?\"",
            "Some passersby overhears her rant, and adds, \"You're goddamn right.\"",
            "\"Then welcome to the modern age, and the biggest problem we've created that we can't solve,\" I tell her, turning the corner of the last aisles on the first side of the store that get into the liquor. \"Be glad you're not included in it.\"",
            "\"But you don't have to do any of that.\"",
            "\"Not when everybody else does,\" I muse. \"Imagine if everybody spoke a special language, and you decided not to learn it.\"",
            "\"Then they should speak the old language.\"",
            "\"The new language has funny pictures in it, though: or it used to be funny pictures. Now it's just pictures about depression.\" She narrows her eyes, without even the faintest thread of understanding to tug at. \"Hell, maybe you should just close the door and never come back.\"",
            "\"But look at all this.\" She gestures to the rows and rows of produce. Whole chickens and hams wrapped in plastic. People filling their carts with an abundance. \"How the Res do your people make all this?\"",
            "\"It's all science,\" I say, grabbing a bagged salad that I'll buy to feel good about myself and probably forget in the back of the refrigerator. \"It's a world that's connected everywhere. Not a square inch of land uncharted, and we've figured out exactly how to trade stuff with each other.\"",
            "\"But what about wars and borders? No new land means it's a war for what's there, right?\" Katiya lifts a clear carton of cotton candy-flavored grapes.",
            "\"Please. Just wait for your world to develop the last weapon it ever will: one that can wipe an entire city off a map. One with such power that it leaves the victims as no more than shaded shadows on the wall, giving the survivors illnesses that carry from generation to generation. Then give those weapons to everyone. And then you'll understand why we don't dispute those silly lines we shake hands over,\" I tell her.",
            "I realize I've gone a little too far when we're deciding between colors of grapes. Her jaw hangs open. I get the variety pack so Katiya can take them home with her, and usher her to follow me on to the frozen meals section.",
            "\"You seem to know a lot about war,\" she says. \"You seem strong for your world. Did you fight?\"",
            "\"No,\" I say. \"But my brother did.\"",
            "\"Oh.\" ",
            "She hesitates to ask the next question, so I answer for her when we step into the large dairy fridge, feeling the same cold he must have felt when he had the bloody holes in his abdomen. ",
            "\"But he never came back.\"",
            "\"I'm sorry.\"",
            "\"I just think that—\" war is, but I stop myself, unwilling to go that far this soon.",
            "Katiya fills the space with her own words. \"It must have been hard.\"",
            "\"It's been hard. It was roughly five years ago. Inspired me to make something in college,\" I say.",
            "She looks down at her calloused hands, then traces the faint outline of a scar that spans from her eye down her cheek.",
            "I stop her before the pleasantries. \"I'd rather not talk about it.\"",
            "She grasps the mesh of the cart as we walk down the frozen food aisle, maybe feeling again that I detest something about her.",
            "\"But I need frozen stuff for work,\" I say, \"and maybe you can get something, too. Have you tried an eggwich?\""

            "\"Our people can live past a hundred and fifty if they have enough Essence. The Mask of the old Northaven royalty is pushing a hundred and sixty, I think — Ullrich, and he looks no older than my mother,\" she says.",
            "\"Good for you, then. Let's just get this over with,\" I tell her, lacing up the trainers I've kept loose for years so that I can slide my feet into them.",
            "It's only when I see Katiya in her last-century running gear that I notice the fabric she wrapped her bra straps in around her shoulders, and the deep lines of crimson dug in from every single run.",
            "\"So you haven't invented that yet, huh?\" I mutter.",
            "\"Apparently we haven't invented a lot of things,\" she says, scratching the deep line worn into her shoulders. \"What is it now?\"",
            "\"Hold on,\" I tell her, returning to my world: stabilizing myself as my mind catches up with the temporal shift, sprinting up the stairs to tear through my dresser for the gym drawer. ",
            "\"Are you skipping out on me, you pushover?\" She asks.",
            "First drawer? No . . . second drawer? Nope . . . and third? I find the tight surf shirt I bought freshman year when I thought I'd have time to ever enjoy the beach: tearing the tag off as I race back down the stairs.",

            "She fumes as she removes the bra, holding her other shirt in her right hand. \"There. Better now, huh?\"",
            "\"Should be better for you,\" I say, wiping a tear from my eyes as I catch a glimpse of the BILLABONG logo stretched out where my chest might loosely brush against it. And two bumps from the cool mountain air flowing through the back window.",
            "She traces the path of my eyes before I can remove them, and when she realizes what's got me flustered, she flips the bottom of the shirt up to double-pad her breast, exposing the toned definition in her abs.",
            "\"You degenerate! Tricking a woman into exposing herself like that?\" She reaches for the knife block on the counter again.",

            "It's morning just like it is in Cody's world, but the air feels fresher: not saturated with the smell of gas and engines like the capital. Sometimes I wonder if Cody's world traded the splendor of nature for every other sensation that overstimulates the senses: the taste of meaty crunch shells; the smell tag that hangs from the front mirror of his automobile; the can of meadow-scented musk he sprays around the room when he thinks I'm not looking, to mask the odor of his messes. ",
            "And in that absence, I think he's begun to enjoy this world, even though it first terrified him. He huffs behind me in desperate gasps of breath, pleading every quarter-pass around the bottom of Lake Gaffesend to take a break, pretending it's because he wants to take in the view.",
            "\"It's incredible,\" he says, drenched in sweat that saturates an oversized shirt of mine in an upside-down triangle. \"This whole area looks like a natural park. Takes three hours of driving to get anywhere like this in Colorado. I'd dream of living here for leisure!\"",

            "\"Yeah. My world would have houses all along the shores, with docks and boathouses.\" He gestures along the distant northern edge where bodies washed ashore last week. \"Families floating in the middle of the lake on pontoon boats. With a meal or something, listening to Jack Johnson and—\"",
            "Every description he tacks on makes my skin crawl. I feel an anger build that I can only remove with pain, with more running. Maybe it was a mistake bringing out an innocent, yellow-bellied civilian that hasn't seen the slightest sliver of war and what it causes. Like my pathetic father that was so damn soft his bones crunched beneath that scalding beam that—",
            "\"Katiya? Hey, what's wrong?\" Cody asks. My nails bite the flesh of my palms and I can feel my face running hot with my muscles tensed. \"Did I upset you? Or did I take too long a break?\"",
            "Your whole life is a fucking break, I want to say, and I feel my jealousy ride on the threshold of that first rule we wrote together. But I see the earnestness in his expression— a feeling nobody in my world has the space for — and it refreshes me, somehow.",
            "I untension my expression. \"It's just that . . . our world has no room for talk like that. We don't talk in wishes. We only talk about what's real, and what might be coming.\"",
            "He purses his lips, tracing an arc of dirt with his toe as he hesitates to look up at me. Seems as if he debates whether to speak his mind on that. \"I think that—\"",
            "\"Katiya?\" Another voice says. \"Is that you?\"",
            "A rush of panic floods my circuits before I can reconcile his name. I glare at Cody, gesturing for him to find somewhere to hide — though when I turn around to face him, I find someone else shamelessly walking next to him.",
            "Jullian walks with Oriya and several of his friends. He tries to bury some sense of shame that threatens to take over, so he hides it with another string of words. \"What are you doing out here? Communing with the bushes?\"",
            "\"I'm going for the run we were supposed to go on,\" I tell him.",
            "\"Supposed to?\" He asks. \"We agreed to go on two runs every week. And not at week's end.\"",
            "\"But we didn't even go this week,\" I tell him, and noticing how the heat rises, his friends walk ahead. \"I thought you said you wanted to spend more time together.\"",
            "\"I was going to tell you,\" Jullian says. \"But you never go on patrol, staying in the town. So it feels like you hardly want to spend time with me, and I'm trying to do the quests that feel like they actually prepare me.\"",
            "My eyes dart between the trail and the underbrush where Cody hides. While Jullian makes his case for ignorance, Cody's expression cycles between disbelief and anger on my behalf, but I shake my head at him, insisting we keep our worlds separate.",
            "Jullian notices my lapse in attention. \"No, what?\"",
            "\"I just . . . don't buy it,\" I say. \"If you really cared about us, about all those years we spent together fighting for a chance at this side of the warfront — if you really cherished what we built together, you would make an effort. Even the smallest thing!\"",
            "\"I did make an effort,\" Jullian says. \"We spent the entire end of last week together!\"",
            "\"That was about an hour. And it was before you insisted on meeting your friends at the bar!\"",
            "\"I asked for you to come. And just like the celebration all those weeks ago, you refused to even try meeting other people in the Guard.\" He looks around to make sure no one else is around. \"Look. I didn't want to bring this up, but I get it if you're humiliated about what happened. The other guards have been talking, but I've been standing up for you,\" he says. \"Every chance I get. And it's exhausting.\"",
            "\"What I wanted was for you to stand with me. How can we stay close if all you ever do is support me from a distance? I needed you that night. Why didn't you even come check on me? Why did you choose your friends over me again?\"",
            "\"Because . . . it's just a lot, you know. You have this brilliant energy about you. The reason I love you. But ever since we came to Gaffesend, it feels like you've changed. So much fuller of these plagues of anxiety and panic, and—\"",
            "\"Are you coming or not, Jullian?\" one of his friends says.",
            "\"Just a minute,\" he shouts, before turning to me again. \"And I'm trying to calm down. To get us to calm down, because we've made it here, and we have no reason to be so afraid.\"",
            "\"What does that have anything to do with being there for me?\"",
            "\"Because I'm tired, Katiya. And—\"",
            "Cody makes a motion with the zipper on his trousers and cuts across the brush behind Jullian, giving him a start. ",
            "\"God abo— I mean, Gods above, I'm glad we stopped for a minute,\" he says, stretching his legs a couple times as my boyfriend turns to confront my housemate. Even though Jullian might be taller and fully Essenced, he looks like a beanpole compared to Cody. ",
            "\"Who the res are you?\" Jullian asks. Then the strangest sense of recognition overtakes him. \"Oh. You're that strange scientist from the Royal Academy! With the glowing square.\"",
            "\"Yep,\" Cody says. \"No idea what this disagreement is about. But your friend was getting upset about all the missed runs, and needed a running partner. So I filled in.\"",
            "\"She's my girlfriend,\" he says. A certain calculus plays in his head, shrivelling his face in a sneer as his mind re-runs the social arithmetic. \"And you live close by?\"",
            "\"Yeah. We're next door-neighbors. The Royal Academy put me here in the military district. Since the houses are already sanctioned for the fighting types, and it's not always a full class that rolls through every time, they had a couple units left over.\"",
            "Jullian's eyes flash between the two of us, and to his friends slowly vanishing down the path. I watch a certain confidence change inside of him.",
            "Cody laughs. \"She's really your girlfriend? I swear, I never see you over there.\"",
            "\"Because I've been busy,\" he insists.",
            "\"Well, don't get too busy, then,\" Cody says. Your girl is beautiful. And if you don't spend enough time with her, she might just run away.\" Cody's eyes narrow with a humored smile. \"With someone else.\"",
            "\"Jullian! Come on. It's gonna be dark before we get back,\" his friends shout.",
            "Cody says, \"You're already in the clothes for it. Wanna finish this run with us and ditch your friends? I have some . . . designing stuff . . . to do after this, so I can't stick around.\"",
            "Jullian hesitates. His eyes meet mine as he squirms between choices, but after a while, it seems the guilt isn't strong enough. \"I already have plans. But let's go tomorrow. How about I stay over tonight?\"",
            "\"And stay?\" I ask.",
            "\"Yeah. And we'll go tomorrow,\" Jullian says, starting to run in the opposite direction to catch up with the other cadets.",
            "\"You sure?\" Cody asks, but Jullian's already running away. He turns to me, squinting his eyes with a smug grin. \"I can see why you like him so much.\"",
            "\"And why's that?\"",
            "\"He runs even more than you do,\" Cody says. \"You found the only man whose mental gymnastics can outpace your neurotic level of fitness.\"",
            "\"Oh, shut up,\" I tell him. But instead of finding a vacant space inside my chest, I find it filled with something else. ",
            "A sense of reassurance.",
            "\"What a loser,\" Cody says. \"So many guys I've met in my life like him: especially back in college. Do you really have no other options? In my world, you'd never pay for a drink in your life!\"",
            "I think of all my female friends from the capital that settled in with children at a young age. Their softness and tenderness. And the way the other men we went out with would look at me: no more than a friend; as almost another guy; unsightly with all the scars from my past. \"Not ever in this world,\" I say.",
            "\"Then this world sucks,\" Cody says. \"You're hot.\" Then adds, \"But it's too bad I don't fall for people that stab me.\"",
            "\"But this world is all I have,\" I tell him. \"And your world is all you have. And Jullian really loves me. We got each other through training, watched each other's sibllings, supported each other enough to make it here, we did everything together!\"",
            "\"But people can change. And now he's a small fish in a much bigger lake.\" He stretches his legs as he digs his heels into the dirt, preparing to make it back without a break.",
            "\"But he's all I have,\" I say, and I mean it. The volume of all those cherished memories is too heavy to ever tip the scales.",
            "\"If you say so,\" Cody says.",
            "We begin jogging back. I run at practically a walk so Cody has enough breath to speak in fuller sentences.",
            "\"But thank you,\" I interject. \"Really, though. For standing up for me.\"",
            "\"He just needs to realize. How much you're worth, Katiya,\" Cody says. \"If you really insist, on this guy, then . . . you've gotta, shake him out of it.\"",

            "I scratch away at the yellow engineering pad, sketching my own ideas instead of relying on others all the damn time. It's easy to draw in 3D when it's just a plate with a few holes in it: far different from the radical ideas my adversary is coming up with.",

All the while, I consider the different ways I can design the enclosure, sketching several different designs between scrolls through social media to keep up on the people I used to know.",

The rusted wall fan makes enough noise that only Wilbur can hear my words, so I feel like I'm able to speak openly. \"I think I just had a different idea of what engineering was. I liked designing things. But it was when something happened to me — or to someone in my family, I guess — that really made me chase it.\" I look at the 3D-printed mini model on my desk that I made to show my brother all those years ago. He was amazed by it: so similar to the tech he got to use in the military.",

            "\"More so flying things. But smaller. And not for people,\" I say.",
            "\"Drones,\" he says. And when he answers right, I hand him the little geometric prototype. \"This is really cool! When did you make this? And did you make a full-size one?\"",
            "\"Yeah,\" I say. \"For Senior Design: after the incident, they let me pretty much be my own sponsor if I could fork the cash.\" I feel a rare sense of passion flood my body, and for a moment, I feel almost like Reed. \"I led the team to develop it: they let me take on some junior engineers at the school. And you see those gears?\" I point at a small pattern in the lines of PLA plastic.",
            " \"Yeah. Heck — if this is like 1:10 scale, those must have been really small,\" Wilbur says.",

The vibrations in the tether rattle the bones in my arms, casting sparks of hot iron, and when I'm close enough to drop and run, I use the force of the fall to dig the toe of my boots between cobblestones.

Three steps behind, we approach the old castle shed, separated from the grounds of the Estate. To a layman, it would be a dead end—but for someone with knowledge of the Royal Guards—it's an ancient egress point, and when she enters the small storeroom lined with aged tools from centuries ago, she knows to slip beneath the busted trapdoor to drop down into the ancient tunnels.",

When I land in the calf-high sludge, I cast a plume of fire that bounces between the walls, lighting the lines of the long earthen tomb until it sizzles in the water, just long enough to see her silhouette shrink down the straightaway.",

            "I find the energy to yell. \"You're not getting away from me,\" I shout, and when we break the threshold of the courtyard, we find drifters and vagrants making camp with tattered sheets, stoking fires with their meager Essence. She scales the stairs of the main edifice, and I wonder why she gains height when it only means she's getting further from the ground.",

            "But then she jumps onto a roof of a wooden building in the servants' quarter. She yelps when her foot crashes through the ceiling, withdrawing as I decide to approach from the other side, aiming for the central beam of the frame instead of the eaves.",
            "We're neck-and-neck as she lumbers with the stolen tool and I struggle with my armor, not quite in grabbing distance when the fall is too much of a consequence. She's heading for the other side of the castle rampart bordering the industrial warehouses, and when I think I'm about to grab her, she channels all her Essence into accelerating for one final sprint.",
            "My breath tastes like poison when it leaves my lungs. Falling further behind, I watch as she runs directly for the edge of the castle wall, as if to jump to her death. But without hesitation, she clambers onto a straightaway of stone slabs, managing seven strides before she launches herself over the edge.",
            "She vanishes from sight. And I wager she's planned this all from the start: planning to live and steal another day, so before the hesitation seizes my muscles, I take the same seven steps and launch myself over the edge.",
            "I can feel the turbulence of wind as gravity comes to collect on my four-story climb. Behind me, I hear Jullian cry my name, and beneath me, a yawning gap spans a thousand years of progress between the old castle and the tall industrial building.",

I hinge my legs in anticipation of crashing into the gravel roof, and after she rolls off her fall, I thrust myself with a plume of flames to break my speed enough to twist myself into a barrel roll.",
            "The roof is small, high, and flat, surrounded by the stark eaves of industrial buildings that are unnavigable. Out of breath, she rushes for the roof access door, only to find it locked, desperately jimmying the round handle as she groans in exasperation.",

            "A look of shameful relief flushes her face. Sweat mixes with tears she refuses to allow to break the threshold of her eyes. \"I never wanted it to end up this way,\" she says. \"Aren't you afraid they'll send you to die? And then what will you do?\"",
            "\"I don't know,\" I tell her. \"But you can choose something else.\"",
            "She makes for the stairway as I hear a dozen footfalls reach the gravel lot below. Then she hesitates. \"There's something brewing from the East, I hear,\" she says. \"Melenia's had a dangerous change in its royalty. And I've heard things.\"",
            "\"Heard what?\" I ask.",
            "\"Just stay aware,\" she says. \"Watch the East. And . . . tell my sister, that I'm still alive.\"",

            "It came scrawled in messy letters that weren't from my world, written on a piece of vellum fresh with ink. It was only four words that would send a chill down any man's spine: especially if they came smaller on the screen of a smartphone.",
            "Cody:",
            "We need to talk.",
            "- Katiya",
            "But it came with a plate that wasn't from my world, like some kind of antique I'd find at my grandmother's house, with a hot-cross bun that tasted fresher than anything I'd find at the Sunday farmer's market.",
            "But she wasn't mad at least, I thought. And I was right. She was asking me a favor, because she volunteered me for something I never asked to do, because she considered me weak enough to fill the role.",
            "And after I strolled around her town to size me for clothes that wouldn't make me stand out too much, I find myself now standing in an open lot with loads of other townsfolk, arranged in a laughable formation, feeling like I'm at a little-league lacrosse practice if all the dads were swapped out for the kids.",
            "The Royal Guards line the dirt-and-grass lot with sheathed swords. We all face the most important guy, standing at the front as he tries not to laugh at the sorry arrangement of rejects that are only here for the free beer after the event. But at least it's for a good cause. And she volun-told me in advance early enough that I could take paid time off.",
            "\"Gentlemen, I'm honored to gather you all here today,\" Katiya's commander says. \"Though our guards are powerful and skilled enough to defend all of Gaffesend, this a chance for you to develop the tools to defend yourselves. To feel comfortable and safe.\"",
            "The only time I remember doing anything like this was at some other kid's karate party when I was in first grade. And the instructor had to break the balsa wood plank with his own hands, because I was afraid of hurting myself. I look down at the wooden training sword, hoping it's just an odd prop for one of those weird stretching exercises.",
            "I feel a hand on my shoulder. A stocky man whispers in my ear. \"So Katiya roped you into this too, huh? To get her two?\"",
            "\"I guess so,\" I say. \"My hands are soft: I design stuff all day.\"",
            "\"And I'm a baker. Name's Derry,\" he says, and I shake his large, calloused hand without turning around—too afraid of getting yelled at, though the three rows of husky townies hide me well. \"What part of town are you in?\" I don't think I've seen you around.",
            "My nervousness impedes my filter. \"I live with Katiya,\" I say.",
            "\"With her?\" He asks.",
            "\"No. No . . . I mean, close to her. Next to her,\" I say. ",
            "\"Oh. So what do you do for the military then?\"",
            "My mind races back on Katiya's collection of rehearsed lies. \"I'm one of the Royal Scientists' prot g s, so they wedged me in with the others, doing some research in Gaffesend.\"",
            "\"Well I don't blame you for being close to Katiya. If I was thirty years younger, with a body like that, I'd fight a damn war for a woman like her,\" he says, reminding me of most of the technicians at my work. But the commander's voice cuts us off, before Derry can objectify her any further.",
            "\"Most of you are too, uh . . . 'heavy-set' for running, so today will focus on basic, self-defense sword fighting and feats of strength.\" I flex and feel for the strength in my arms, hoping my two-a-week workouts give me enough muscle to overpower an Essenced tavern-brawler. He continues: \"While our brave, senior soldiers guard the borders of Gaffesend, this is a chance for our trainees to pass on their knowledge.\"",
            "I look to Katiya, flushed with that same sense of anxiety that seems like her factory setting. She musters a smile when we meet eyes, standing next to her beanpole boyfriend with their swords drawn, and as Aldrin rambles on about the value of self-defense like a first-amendment technician at my work, I twirl the wooden training sword in the dirt.",
            "\"So we'll start with basic technique. I'm sure most of you have at least been trained a little — maybe by a family member or something.\" I remember playing defense in Lacrosse, jabbing breastplates with the basket end of my stick, and that's about it: besides shooting clays with my godfather in the FBI — but that's at least a hundred years away for these people.",
            "He shows us a basic downward swing before instructing us to stand further apart. I try a couple swings like all the others, without a single idea of what I'm doing, and when the other cadets start to approach, I catch Katiya laughing at me.",
            "I flip her the bird, hoping sign language crosses our understandings: catching a glare from Jullian as he approaches to help his own two volunteers.",
            "Katiya says, \"The point is to swing through something. Don't stop short!\"",
            "\"But there's nothing to swing at,\" I say.",
            "\"Then swing at me,\" she says. I recall my father's words about hitting a girl. And then she adds: \"You've already done it once before, haven't you? So what's the difference?\" Her lips peel into a mischievous smile, ready to hurl as many insults as it takes for me to go all out.",
            "Derry hands Katiya his wooden sword to add some fuel. \"She's one of the tough ones. I bet you won't last a minute.\"",
            "And with enough pressure, I chance a light swing at her. She slashes with half her power, nearly knocking the training sword out of my hands.",
            "\"I've seen toddlers with less hesitation,\" she says. She swings the sword a couple times to draw the attention of other townies, adding pressure for me to defend my manhood. They turn their heads. \"Come on: do your worst, Cody of Denver!\"",
            "I white-knuckle the hilt of the sword like a baseball bat, taking a hard swing from the side. Katiya hardly twists her sword, and my blade glides up the polished flat surface.",
            "My momentum shifts entirely upright as I continue to spin, so committed to the strike that the training blade launches out of my hands. It travels point-first as it spins in the air like a surface-to-air missile with guards for fins, launching towards the commander as he recognizes all the turning faces.",
            "My muscles crumple faster than my soul as I watch Katiya's face change from humor to horror. Aldrin raises his arm in an instant, catching the smooth edge with a single hand. The edgeless blade slides for its full length before stopping at the hilt, the dull point halted inches from his face.",
            "He looks around at all the startled townsfolk, astounded at how quickly this training session descended into disarray. Once he traces the trajectory, the scarred commander stares daggers at me as he approaches from the center of the field. Dealing with my varsity coach was hard enough when I whipped that hard rubber lacrosse ball past his head: I've never pissed off a warrior like him.",
            "He doesn't even have to open his mouth before I'm off in apologetics. He draws the sword so it points directly at my chest.",
            "\"I, uh, do numbers and stuff. I'm not any kind of warrior,\" I insist.",
            "But Katiya cuts in. \"It was my fault, Chief. I egged him on by insulting him a little. I wanted to see him angry.\"",
            "I think he's going to skewer me and roast my flesh over a spit, but he flips the blade around in his hands so that the hilt faces me. \"What's your name, son?\"",
            "The townsfolk look on with secondhand shame. Aldrin turns to around to shoo their focus away, and by the time I answer, they've all returned to practicing techniques.",
            "\"Cody. Well, you have the passion,\" he says. \"And a strong arm. But you need to channel that into technique.\" He gestures to Katiya for her wooden sword. \"Is it alright if I borrow your volunteer?\"",
            "Katiya nods.",
            "\"The most important thing in sword fighting is balance, Mister Cody,\" Aldrin says. \"You put all your power into a single swing — but what were you planning to do after?\"",
            "I stammer as the weight of the sword in my hands becomes awkward. \"I . . . I'm not sure,\" I say, \"sir.\"",
            "\"Don't be ashamed, son. You've done the Gods' work coming out today as a volunteer, and I'm grateful you're here. But Miss Katiya, here, is a true professional.\" ",
            "And it feels like a lion training a chihuahua.",
            "Aldrin turns to Katiya. \"Why don't you show Mr. Cody a standard forward strike?\"",
            "We stand aside. Katiya balances her feet so that her non-dominant foot is in front, with her hips facing forward. The steel sword slides out of her sheath with an iconic ring.",
            "\"And, see, her goal is to close the gap between herself and the enemy with the blade,\" Aldrin says. \"But notice there, how she steps away slightly?\"",
            "\"Yeah,\" I say, transfixed at her training. She slashes forward with a perfect overhead swing, but steps slightly to the side with her dominant foot.",
            "\"And why don't you explain how this ties into balance, Katiya?\" Aldrin asks.",
            "\"The line of action goes directly at the enemy. But I step aside, in case there's a counterattack. It lets you keep your balance,\" she says.",
            "Aldrin claps me on the back, handing me the training sword. \"Why don't you give it a shot?\" He asks.",
            "I draw my left foot forward, as if I'm beaming a lacrosse ball across the field for a breakaway. But I get confused with my footing.",
            "\"Why don't you practice with him, Katiya? Hold the sword with him.\" But then her face flushes. \"Don't be embarrassed. Mister Dunsmore needs to learn,\" he says, smiling as he withdraws.",
            "Katiya hesitantly approaches from behind me. I feel the cold steel of her breastplate press against my back as she reaches her gauntlets to grasp my hands, and I refuse to even try looking at Jullian. Her steel boots align with my feet as I stand off-foot-forward, and as I slice down with the wooden sword, her hips press into mine, guiding my legs to swing in rhythm with the sword, and I end up to the side of that perfect line of action.",
            "\"Don't get used to it,\" she whispers in my ear, and I swear I can feel the heat radiate off her face.",
            "\"Very good,\" Aldrin says. \"Now give me a hundred of those: now!\" ",
            "I tense in tonal panic, locked with the sword in its last position. ",
            "Aldrin laughs. \"Sorry. Force of habit. Do, uh . . . twenty or something, yeah?\"",
            "\"Sir, yes sir,\" I say, as if I'm a pledge in the fraternity again.",
            "I take a couple practice swings, mirroring Katiya's technique as best as I can. And as Derry steps to the side—relieved he doesn't have to leverage his husky frame for sword practice, ever closer to the free ale on the other side of the session, Katiya takes at least ten minutes before she can turn and face me again."

            " \"If you're on the line right now, you don't mind the chance of getting hurt,\" Aldrin says. His eyes scan the thirsty townies standing behind the line of rope. \"Just because you don't get to drink first if you don't do the course does NOT mean you won't drink at all.\"",
            "\"But all the fucking ale will be gone!\" One of the beer-gutted strongmen says. Even the hesitant men now join the line, shouting in agreement.",
            "\"Well, it's not a race: it's a course,\" Aldrin says. \"And you need to help each other.\" He gestures around the standard training course used by the Royal Guards, bent in a U-shape that ends with kegs and kegs of booze. Some men look like they're about to cut the whole damn course, but the senior guards are back — and Aldrin set them up so no one can cut the others. I can't see the course behind the backs of the tall and muscular farmers and their field hands. I'll have to play it entirely by ear.",
            "\"Your trainees are depending on you to win, because they don't drink until your whole team does. So they'll be cheering you on, all along the way,\" Aldrin says.",
            "I can feel the adrenaline coarse through my veins, but mostly from the fear of getting crushed or stepped on. ",
            "Derry's hand rests on my shoulder. \"You're a young fella, and fast, I bet. You'll be able to shoot right through there!\"",
            "\"If they let me,\" I tell him.",
            "\"I'll make them,\" he says.",
            "Aldrin counts down. Even for a fun run, I can feel the pressure mount on me as Katiya watches—and every time we meet eyes, I feel the urge build to impress her.",
            "He holds an archaic gun into the air. I hold my breath, waiting for the blast like it's winter track season all over again. I stagger my feet and let my fingers soak into the cold, wet soil, and just as I'm about to anticipate the blast, I feel Derry's hands grasp my back.",
            "The gun blast echoes between the mountains. Derry pushes me with all his strength, and suddenly I stagger into first: sliding a quarter-distance of the mud pit beneath the barbed wire.",
            "I was a three-sport athlete, and I immediately think back to football season in the fall, when snow still saturated the frozen ground, and I'm lighter than I was then when I wore pads and a helmet. Lighter than the ones before me, my elbows thrash the ground as mud splashes in my face, peerless in the moment, absorbed in the cheers that crescendo with my name.",
            "My old-world shirt is soaked in heavy mud, and I'm drenched down to the Under Armor compression shirt, but I feel that rare window of joy seize my body in its entirety, and I'm thankful my emotional curse doesn't eclipse my enjoyment of the moment. I hear the sloshing and clambering of men that look like Vikings, grunting and growling with their lust of liquor.",
            "I rise at the end of the mud crawl, glancing back to find my teammate Derry not far behind: his wife cheering him on from the sidelines. I hear Katiya shout my name, and turn to face the next obstacle: a tall climbing wall with several ropes hanging from the top. I'm not as light as I was after a whole four years of shotgunning beers in the fraternity, but it feels as if I have circuits like Katiya, from all the energy that floods my veins.",
            "My hands grasp the ragged weave of rope, tucking it beneath my arm as I take the first steps up the wall. The eyes are all on me now as I compensate for my previous failure. My arms grab hand-over-hand as the mud-soaked townies clamber like zombies, with groans that lust for liquor instead of brains, shaking the rope as they grasp it themselves, destabilizing my footing on the wall.",
            "But I tighten my hands on the rope. Past halfway, I find it stretches less, advantaged by the boost from Derry that left the rope loose for much of my ascent. And as I approach the top, I feel my stomach drop when I look at the other side.",
            "I thought it was another rope down. But instead, I find three logs spanning a two-story-high stretch from one tower to another: the bottom filled with murky, freezing water of an unknown depth. The adrenaline outpaces the panic as the crowd of knights and supporters shifts up to watch as I take my first steps on the log: tempted to hug and hump my way across, but I take a deep breath and take my time.",
            "So far down, Katiya and Jullian stand beside each other, along with Pax and Ryder and the catgirl Naya and a pale-looking Bertram that shakes his fist.",
            "I scrape my muddy feet before I proceed: still a ways ahead of the others, and I take my time stepping across—like an alcoholic walking a line to show an officer that he can drive.",
            "But I catch an odd footing. Panic seizes my chest when the elevation imposes itself, and I fall to my chest as the crowd groans in anticipation. But I hear their cheers still coming strong: Pax chanting \"Science Guy\" in their tongue until the others join, and they cheer when I regain my footing, stumbling slowly before I make it to the other side.",
            "Next is a span of sixteen-or-so bars dangling over the same sickening drop. I doubt my adrenaline will last if I don't keep going: un-Essenced like the others and at a certain disadvantage.",
            "But I continue: taking the first suspended bar in my hands as my feet decide whether they want to leave the safety of the platform, making the mistake of looking down and noticing patches of grass I HOPE are just floating, and not islands that would break my legs.",
            "But the excitement is too great. My exhilarated mind flashes back to the breakaways of all those lacrosse games I miss so damn much with Miguel—and lost in the emotional rhyme, I realize I'm already halfway across, steadily swinging between rails until I make it to the other side.",
            "I turn back to find Derry waving at the other side, making some gesture I interpret as a \"thumbs-up\" as he waits to cross, using his meager townie Essence to strengthen his grasp before it's his turn to cross the bars.",
            "The end of the towers is a series of vertical ropes. And as the others gain on me with their powerful arms, swinging like silverback gorillas, I slide down the rope after saturating my hands in the cool mud caked on my undershirt, regaining my footing as I make it to the bottom.",
            "I reach the end of the 'U'-shape to find the joining section as a simple sprint before more low-level towers at ground height, and I take off for the next side, watching as the Essenced knights double my speed to get a spot on the other side.",
            "I feel a presence behind me. One of Jullian's non-guard buddies I recognize from before uses his advantage to sprint faster, and he's several breaths behind me as we round the last turn of the U-shape, coming to a near stop as we approach a bunch of logs that protrude from a gravel pit: a series of one-footed jumps that focus on technique over strength.",
            "Half cheer my name. But half cheer for my adversary, named Delvin. We balance the desire for speed over the failure of the fall, wagering the swiftness of every jump. And as we're neck-and-neck, I decide to dash the rest of the logs, back in first as I make it to the last challenge.",
            "All that's left is one last straightaway with hurdles. It was my event in track when I was lighter, and had a six-pack on my body instead of in my hand every weekend. But the muscle memory is there, and as I take lane two of six, my rival takes four as we sprint with all we have, letting the fanfare flood our muscles where our exasperated breath falls short.",
            "My steps reach a rhythm like I'm sprinting down the hundred-meter span of hurdles on my high school track: over the long logs in seven steps and a leap, seven steps and a leap, seven steps and a leap.",
            "The goal is getting closer, stacked with kegs. The beautiful town ladies are tensioned with corsets that rise their breasts as a beckoning call to the grizzly men behind us, raising mugs of fresh ale as sirens that call their lascivious warriors to come.",
            "A leap and seven steps. A leap and seven steps. And I see Katiya at the finish, smiling ear-to-ear as her boyfriend stands next to her, cheering on Delvin. And I'm so close now, about to place first, when I hear a pained groan and a loud exhale as Delvin crumples into the second-to-last log hurdle.",
            "And I stop in my tracks, inches from the finish. I look behind me to find Delvin grasping his chest without wind as the horde of others is quickly approaching.",
            "But I decide to turn around as I huff for breath, climbing over the log to approach my rival, offering him a hand so he can rise from the sullen ground.",
            "I take his arm across my shoulders. A few racers sprint past us, transfixed by the boobs and ale ahead of them. And as we stumble over the logs in steps instead of leaps, I feel Delvin's weight shift when Derry grabs his other arm.",
            "We finish twelfth-or-so. Katiya and all her friends congratulate the three of us when we cross. The air stinks of salty sweat, but the ale is sweet and savory as we chug the carbonated brew like cold water.",
            "We hang around for a while until Aldrin presents an award to first place, and though he recognizes my efforts, he presents it to another lean, younger man that passed us while we carried Delvin. Katiya and a few friends watch my face as I react to this loss, and though Delvin is distraught, I laugh and cheer as the winner holds his makeshift trophy in the air.",
            "I find an emotion in Katiya's face that I've never seen before. She looks away when I return her glance. Her other friends chatter on about how I deserve the title, and even Jullian offers me words of encouragement, thanking me for aiding his friend.",
            "A long day ends with us walking home. I say I left my stuff at Katiya's so we could all walk together, and when they're all distracted, I slip inside and disappear through the door—quick to feel the bliss of a hot shower.",
            "After toweling off, I head downstairs to grab a glass of water in my boxers. I hear Jullian and Katiya heading upstairs on their side of the dimensional wall. Katiya whispers something to Jullian as he continues to climb the stairs, and after she takes off her heavy boots, I hear her footfalls as she approaches my door.",
            "She knocks with a knuckle. I'm quick to answer on the other side, peeking out no more than my head and a shoulder.",
            "\"Hey — thanks for doing this today,\" she whispers. \"You surely didn't start off so well, but you ended in a blaze.\"",
            "\"Of course,\" I tell her. \"It was worth the PTO.\"",
            "She turns to close the door, but then hesitates for a moment: something still on her mind that she's tempted to ask. \"But at the end there . . . you were surely going to win,\" she says. \"Why did you give Delvin a hand before you crossed?\" ",
            "She looks up with anticipation, as if she disbelieves the face I wore when they were handing out awards. But something makes her want to hear me say it: to convince her of something.",
            "And so I tell her the truth.",
            "\"I just didn't think the ale would taste any different,\" I whisper. \"You know?\""

            "\"I just don't see how this shirt looks any different,\" I say, \"you know?\"",
            "He glares at me through the door. \"Different? You still look like you were ripped out of the high Middle Ages.\" ",
            "I have no idea what he means. \"But it's a shirt with a collar, right?\" I ask. \"I don't have the fancy noble clothes from your world. This was woven by hand!\"",
            "\"And it looks like you're off to add your name to the Drclaration Of Independence,\" he says. Cody cracks a smile as he slips his feet onto a pair of his work shoes, wearing what he calls a weekend-formal shirt with stretchy fabric and a sharp collar.",
            "\"Are you really sure you want me to go, then? All you've done is insult me since I showed you the only other outfit I have,\" I say. \"I'm dressed by the guard. They only let me take a hundred pounds of personal items when I came here.\"",
            "\"It shows,\" he says.",
            "I sneer at him. \"Are you done?\"",
            "He rises to his feet, taking one last glance at the odd texture of my shirt: thin in some areas, and mildly frayed from wearing it beneath my armor.",
            "\"Not yet. Give me a second,\" he says, retreating back upstairs to rustle through his cupboard. Half a minute later, he returns with another nice shirt. It's stitched with the letters NAVIDSON-MONROE: evidently woven by one of the fancy machines of his world.",
            "\"I'm going to fill a whole closet from you at this rate,\" I say, hesitant to take another garment.",
            "\"It's been like a month since the last time I gave you that shirt,\" he says. \"And we still haven't even properly shopped for you yet. I got this in a New Years raffle from my company when they were trying to empty out the old employee storeroom. It's a women's medium, and I don't have the body for it.\"",
            "He extends his hand though the doorway. I crack the door shut to quickly change, trading the bright, uneven stitch-work for a smooth, silken, short-sleeve polo, surprised by how little I feel of the texture — and in moments like these, it makes me hesitant to indulge any further in even the simplest of his world's conveniences.",
            "\"Well?\" He asks. I crack the door open again as he takes his work passport into his pocket. His eyes glow with a certain sarcastic pride. \"You look like a new intern. Just don't ask the guys for any questions on your projects, or they'll never leave you alone.\"",
            "I get the impression it's some backhanded compliment. \"I'll be quiet unless talked to.\"",
            "\"No, not this time,\" he says. \"The whole point is to interact with people! You get to meet my team: it's an open house. The world left behind keeping women quiet a while ago.\"",
            "\"Okay. And...\" I gesture to my boots: the last oddity we haven't discussed. It's the casual pair, emblazoned with the faintest trace of metal around the toe and heel. \"Are these really okay?\"",
            "\"Just means you can go on the floor, if you're wearing steel toes like that.\" Cody gestures for me to enter his car port. \"You look fine. We should really get moving, or else they'll eat all the pizza before we can even get there.\"",
            "He cracks the door to the car port, and the solid steel gate slides along the rails. It's been more than a month since my first and last adventure in his car, and I feel ready to withstand all the twists and turns.",
            "I gently feather the car door open and sit in the seat. My body feels so light and free without the weight of the armor, as if I'm wearing nothing at all, and after he pulls out of the car room into the street, the gate closes behind us.",
            "We take a different route this time, driving straight instead of turning left. It's been about a month since the self-defense training program, and with all that time passed in forgettable engagements, we share a couple stories from our lives.",
            "I describe how fast the town of Gaffesend transitions from festive joy to dreadful unease. I talk about the letters from my family back home, and how proud they say they are of my brother and I — though I'm glad they aren't around to see what the other townsfolk think. I tell him how my mistake still overshadows me, and that I'm glad they've forgotten my foolish leap between buildings, and how I've returned to prowling the streets.",
            "He tells me about work, but doesn't say much: just that he's nervous about being let go, and that he's developing something \"stupid\" that might make or break his career. I'm entranced by the unfamiliar foliage that whips past us, pretending we're driving on the backroads between Gaffesend and the capital, surprised at how open Cody's world actually is when you get away from all the tall buildings.",
            "I ask him about Kei: he says not much has changed. He asks me about Jullian, and I say not much has changed, either: still middling in our relationship.",
            "His eyes glaze over with an unfamiliar joy when we wind the switchbacks, taking the turns with a certain passion, and though we're taking his daily passage to work, I doubt it's related to his employment.",
            "We pull up to the gates an hour after midday to find them open. The armor-less guard waves us through, and we come to a stop in a large dirt lot.",
            "Cody looks at me before we exit, as if to say something, but then his face falls. ",
            "\"Damn it,\" he says.",
            "\"What?\"",
            "He rifles through the center cupboard on his car, pulling out a cheap pair of dark glasses with letters on the side. \"Here.\"",
            "\"For what?\"",
            "\"I forgot about your eyes,\" he says. \"I just got so used to them from looking in them all the time.\"",
            "My face flushes. \"Are you—\"",
            "\"No . . . no! Not at all. Calm down,\" he says, covering his face with a nicer pair of glasses as he gestures for me to exit. I CAREFULLY open the door, so I don't hit the vehicle next to me.",
            "\"You keep disguising glasses on you?\" I ask. \"When would you need them?\"",
            "\"They protect your eyes from the sun, dummy,\" he says, overcompensating for his accidental pick-up line. I feel my nerves rise as we approach the massive building, shaded like night as I look through the lenses, my body masked behind Cody as a nervous shadow.",
            "An unfamiliar voice calls to him as we approach his colleagues. \"So you finally made it to your first work event,\" the lady says. \"Even I made it to one before you!\" Her face changes when she sees me step out from behind Cody, reminding me a little bit of Jullian. \"And who is this you brought?\"",
            "\"This is Katiya. A neighbor of mine,\" Cody says.",
            "\"Nice to meet you,\" I say, speaking seamlessly in Cody's tongue.",
            "\"And I'm Kei,\" she says, shaking my hand gently. \"Kei Sakurashima.\""

            "The installation looks like one of those dug-in shelters on the border of the Purgatory Line, and when we enter the quaint area dug into the side of the mountain, facing the set of reflective steel doors, I expect they'll open to a grand chamber beneath the ground.",
            "But when Cody's paramour presses the glowing arrow button, the doors slide open with a chime, exposing a tiny room that the three of us enter. The metal doors are just about to close when a fourth guy shows up, sticking his hands directly into the metal jaws to keep them open.",
            "It's a young man with the same aesthetic as Cody, except he has beach-blonde hair and a much more energized personality. He stares at me with his hazel eyes. \"Ha! Looks like I made it just in time,\" he says. \"Cody, my man, and Kei. And who are you?\"",
            "His conversational flow throws me off guard, stammering for words, but he speaks again.",
            "\"I'm Reed. Reed Broderick,\" he says, extending his hand.",
            "\"I'm Katiya,\" I manage, giving his hand a gentle-but-firm shake. \"Katiya Bre—\"",
            "But as soon as the doors close, the room jostles upwards, catching me off guard as I nearly fall, taking both Cody and Reed's hands.",
            "The two men lift me to my feet.",
            "\"Bad hangover, huh?\" Kei asks. \"I hope Cody didn't challenge you to any drinking games. Ever since he joined that fraternity, he became a fish!\"",
            "I ask, \"A fish? As in...\"",
            "Cody cuts the silence with a laugh. \"Very funny. We thought we'd pregame this little mixer to make it go faster, you know?\" And then he takes me aside, muttering to me under the tone of his breath. \"You can take the shades off now.\"",
            "\"But my eyes,\" I whisper. \"Won't they think I'm weird?\"",
            "\"It's fine. Remember the lie I gave you?\"",
            "\"Caused-play,\" I say. \"But shouldn't I at least know what caused this?\"",
            "Cody creases his brow with his fingers in disappointment as the man called Reed continues.  \"Well, hey, quite a coincidence you work at Navidson-Monroe too, huh?\" He asks, pointing to my shirt. It says ENGINEERING TEAM beneath it. \"So are you, like, a purchaser or something? Or are you on the Aerospace team? I don't see you in the main office,\" he says.",
            "I stammer over a response, watching Cody prevent his face from changing shades of red when he realizes he's trapped himself again. \"It was that shirt I won in the raffle that didn't fit me,\" he says, \"and I decided to give it to her.\"",
            "Kei laughs. \"You don't have to explain,\" she says, catching contagion of Cody's secondhand embarrassment. \"Unless you're dating or something. But even then, you know. You wouldn't have to...\"",
            "\"We're not,\" Cody insists, turning his eyes down as Reed masterfully switches subjects.",
            "\"Well then I hope it will be a better raffle this year. My dad said they were just emptying out the corporate closet of shirts before the moths could get to them. And all those mugs and pencils and flash drives they were handing out at the job fairs,\" Reed says. His piercing eyes meet mine. \"Say, Katiya: where do you work if you don't work here?\"",
            "\"Oh. I work in, uh, military.\"",
            "Cody elbows me.",
            "\"The military?\" Reed smiles. \"Nice, Just like my cousin. Well, thank you for your service. What branch? Are you at the Air Force base up north or something?\"",
            "\"I'm in the mountains,\" I say, unsure how much further I'm digging myself, wondering if I could ever be ready enough for Cody to bring me anywhere.",
            "Cody interjects, \"She's stationed up near Grand Lake, working on some topographical research, for uh, NOAA.\" He glares at me, but in a humored way. \"Guess we shouldn't have pre-gamed so hard, huh? I told you to start clear.\"",
            "\"Well, you two seem pretty close,\" Kei says. \"Reed and I had to cheat, making each other our plus one.\"",
            "Cody opens his mouth to speak, but then the doors open, just as he ushers the words: \"So you guys...\"",
            "The carriage lets out to a breathtaking atrium with a curved glass ceiling, surrounded on both sides by stairs and private walled rooms. The chatter is almost deafening from the volume of well-dressed people — like a royal ball — and when I look up to the sky, I find a full view of the mountainside through the ceiling glass.",
            "But a lady is poised at the top, standing there with her husband that almost looks like one of our farmers from his brawny arms. As she approaches, exposing a name tag that says KIMBERLY (KIM), I find a reticence suddenly take over Cody, even though it's too late.",
            "\"Kei! Oh, hey, so good to see you,\" she says, smiling with dimples from ear-to-ear. \"And there's my son. Won't you say hello?\"",
            "\"Hey, Mom,\" Cody says. \"And Dad,\" as he approaches.",
            "\"Oh, don't look so surprised. Both my boys work here,\" Cody's mother says. \"I swear. The last time I saw you two cuties dressed up together was Junior Prom. And that's before you vanished into our basement all night, to—\"",
            "Cost lunges between Kei and Reed. \"Whoa, whoa, already too far, Mom,\" he says, redder than a tomato.",

            "Cody's dad almost looks disappointed for a second before Kei interjects. \"Not this time. He brought a neighbor-friend.\"",
            "They turn their faces to me. And after they look me up and down, I almost gleam a sense of pride lighting their faces again.",

            "\"Well isn't he a lucky son of a gun?\" Alan says, and I feel the urge to drag Cody away before his redness turns to blue. Reed begins to introduce himself to Kim with Kei as Alan gestures for us to keep walking. \"Well, don't let an old chunk of coal like me hold you kids up. It's nice to meet ya.\" He gives me a firm handshake. I tension my hand a little harder than usual.  \"And sweet Jesus, she's got a grip!\" He turns to his progeny. Some surly thought skips the queue in his mind. \"Son, you know what they say about strong wrists in a woman—\"",
            "\"Yeah,\" I say, \"nice to meet you.\" I take Cody's hand to rush him to the water table, pulsing some healing Essence into him so he might not pass out, but he seems fine. I barricade us both with a group of young trainees from a local seminary, led around by their instructor.",

And after watching as many of the children's science demonstrations as possible — while Cody eagerly riffed on about all these concepts named after scientists — we take a break on the east balcony that opposes the view from the elevator, looking out across his world's well-developed landscape.",

            "\"Air has a lot of the same properties of fluids, so we call it fluids,\" he says. Then he mentions several scientists from his world as if name-dropping will support his argument. Bernoulli. Lagrange. Some guy he says is an oiler, which sounds like he deals with fluids, only supporting me further.",
            "\"It's Euler,\" he says, beginning to gesture with hands that only hurt his explanation. \"So there's streamlines, like this,\" he gestures, \"that you look at,\" he gestures, \"you know,\" he gestures again, \"and then there's streaklines. And you can look at it through the LaGrangian form that emphasizes states of a moving frame of reference, but the Euler form is for a control volume FIXED instead of moving, and in Aerospace, which is what I want to get into, I find that . . .\"",
            "There's something entrancing about his passion when he rattles on about concepts I can't hope to understand. I find such a radiant light when I meet eyes with his, and he thinks he's explaining it clearly.",
            "I nod my head as I turn to gaze out across the landscape, still bright with early-morning sun, trying to wrap my head around the fact that this whole landmass is safe from ocean to ocean. And with no clear lines partitioning them, the buildings grow like weeds without the culling force of constant conflict.",

Pray tell: do you know how many people have the emotional resources to be passionate like you where I live?\" I say. \"Your people focus on designing planes and big machines. All our people have to think about is what's moving around in the dark.\"",
            "\"That's why you should come over more,\" Cody says. \"You might have scared me at first, but I like spending time with you now.\"",
            "I adjust my sweaty hand on the hot steel railing, unaware I'm sliding closer to his. \"You aren't too bad either,\" I say. We touch with a spark, then withdraw our hands. \"A good friend. I'm just afraid of getting comfortable with all of this.\"",

            "We step inside to tour the last section we haven't seen yet: the Engineering showroom, with models of all the famous planes like the Flawless Diamond and the SR-71. Cody continues his ramblings, dumbing them down a little further as I look at him with a refreshing sense of admiration. He talks in my language of war: about the big bombs named after a little boy and a heavy man, and the cold war between nations that followed. The planes were made for spy missions, surveying enemy lands at unfathomable speeds.",
            "\"Maybe one day I can see the view from one of those,\" I say.",
            "\"Maybe you will,\" he says, turning to face the last presentation wall we haven't seen yet. It reads FUTURE ENGINEERING TALENT, with a few profiles of new engineers. ",
            "He scans through the posted pages like trainees at the Academy after an exam. ",
            "\"What is this?\" He asks, trying to mask his words as only those of curious interest, but then mutters, \"a fucking email sent to them?\" His fingers trace the dates of hire. \"Some have been here longer than I have!\" And when his hand reaches the profile on the guy in the elevator, his hand balls into a fist.",
            "I approach him. \"What's wrong?\"",
            "He pulls out his smart telephone, scrolling frantically through it, opening an app with messages that read longer than a simple text. He scrolls the subjects of those correspondences, getting angrier and more dejected as he looks further and further. \"So they just don't consider me, huh? Because my dad doesn't have a fucking name around here, and I came from nothing, so they—\" He curbs his words when he realizes I'm still here. \"Heh. Sorry, Katiya. Just some work stuff,\" he says, smiling with an embarrassed laugh.",
            "He hears voices behind us coming around the hall, and he drags me beneath one of the displays. I open my mouth to protest, but he covers it, and I recognize the voices in an instant.",
            "\"Finally somewhere quiet, huh?\" Reed asks. \"I might be good at the social stuff, but even I'm pretty tapped out.\"",
            "\"And I never get out,\" Kei says. She walks towards the display we're hiding behind. I watch Cody's mind scroll through possible explanations to diffuse the embarrassment, but just as she's about to cross our hiding spot—",
            "\"Here it is,\" Reed says.",
            "\"What?\" We watch Kei's heels pivot as she turns.",
            "\"You never got the email about this?\" He asks. \"You're still new enough, right?\"",
            "\"The new talent wall? I think I forgot to respond to the email about it.\"",
            "\"It was something the Engineering Director was pushing through. Said he wanted to highlight some of the fresh talent.\"",
            "We hear silence as they scan the wall for something. \"There's mine,\" Reed says. But Kei looks further.",
            "\"Huh,\" she says.",
            "\"What?\"",
            "\"I really hope he hasn't come in here,\" Kei says. \"Haven't seen Cody or that neighbor he brought, so I hope they went home.\"",
            "Another silence.",
            "\"Oh. He's not even on the wall,\" Reed says. \"Did he not fill it out?\"",
            "\"He totally would have filled it out. You see the way he looks up at this place? His eyes get more sun dreaming of this place than any of the lifers that sit next to the windows.\"",
            "\"Huh.\"",
            "\"Maybe it was an accident. Some kind of mix-up?\"",
            "\"I don't know about that,\" Reed says.",
            "\"How can you be so sure?\"",
            "\"Just something I've thought about since I came here. Some talk between my dad and his best friend, the Director of Engineering.\"",
            "\"Well, he got you hired here,\" Kei says.",
            "\"But there was more,\" Reed says. \"I was listening to them on the patio out back behind our place. He said he's clearing the way for me. And that 'that other engineer wouldn't be an obstacle.'\"",
            "\"The 'other engineer?' You don't mean...\"",
            "\"He said Cody was unexceptional. Just did his time and left, not really ever trying once he reached a certain point. That the life left him. That he never makes an effort to meet anyone, and that he'd be easy to make an excuse for,\" Reed says, and I watch Cody bow his head as he balls his fists. \"I mean, I like the guy a lot. We're pretty similar, and I really want to be buddies with him.\"",
            "Kei takes a long pause. And I almost think she'll stand up for him. I hope she does, for Cody's sake, but she says something else. \"We used to be pretty close, you know. High school, we dated: just like his mom said, and he was so full of this joy, it was like staring at the sun.\"",
            "Reed asks, \"But what?\"",
            "\"But the summer I left for school was when he lost his brother.\"",
            "\"He lost his brother?\"",
            "\"Yeah. To some conflict in the war: Jackson was a Navy SEAL. And Cody never opened up about it. And by the time his last year of high school ended, he followed me to college, but I couldn't even recognize him. He was just a shell. And he still is, though sometimes there's a glimmer of that guy who had so much joy. That I liked a lot,\" Kei says, looking around nervously. \"I hope something changes. Because he's surely next out of all of us.\"",
            "They turn to leave. And Reed says, \"Well, at least I can be that for you.\"",
            "Kei laughs. \"I still don't know if I'm ready for that,\" she says.",
            "I feel angry for him. I want to stand up and call them out for speaking so ill of him. In fact, I begin to stand, but Cody weakly grabs my borrowed shirt.",
            "\"Stand down, soldier,\" Cody says. \"It's alright. Nothing they said was wrong.\"",
            "\"But this Reed guy is slighting you! His family line is aimed to cut you down because you're in his way, though you're the venerable one,\" I say, grabbing his shirt while I turn his chin to look in my eyes, finding the crest of his tears ready to break.",
            "\"Maybe I deserve it,\" he says. \"I've become a mess since then. I dragged myself through this stupid degree because it's what I used to want to do. I'm running on fumes of a past when I was fueled on that thing: the spark, what Kei and anyone else liked about me.\" He sniffles, trying to keep his tears to a professional medium. \"No passion. No prospect of a girlfriend in years. I don't know . . . I think I just suck now. Even my parents can sniff it out.\"",
            "His words anger me because they insult someone I've come to care about, and it's him, and of all my years of guarding, I feel nothing more than the urge to protect this guy and his precious dream.",
            "I feel the heat rise in my circuits as I grab the collar of his shirt, forcing him to look at me as I pin him against the display. I dissolve his tears with the Essence in my hands. \"You listen. Your dreams are far from stupid, Cody Dunsmore, and you are gods-damn precious,\" I say.",
            "He looks down. \"You're just—\"",
            "\"Shut up,\" I command, jostling him against the wall to shock him into a sense of truth. \"Can't you see that you're already enough as you are? You say the ale doesn't taste any different. And you're the only person I've ever found who means it. You care,\" I say, \"so Gods-damn much about anyone.\"",
            "\"It's just lonely,\" he says. He gestures for me to get off him, and I help him to his feet. \"I think something broke in me that I can't fix.\"",
            "\"What do you mean?\" I ask.",
            "\"I said I'd tell you why I invited you here. I mean, yeah — all the engineers and techs and business guys were ogling you, and you're an amazing piece of arm candy. You even made my family have faith in me again.\" He laughs. \"But I brought you here because I have no one else to share this with. It feels like everyone's left me or moved on. And I'm tired now. And it's getting so late.\"",
            "I wrap my arms around him, letting the heat of my body speak where my words fall short. He hesitates, but then gently returns my embrace, holding for just a second before he releases. And even in his act of forced vulnerability, I almost feel a piece of myself open, too.",
            "\"Bastards,\" he says.",
            "\"Huh?\" I ask.",
            "\"Bastards have probably already eaten their way through the food trucks,\" he says. \"I totally forgot. Usually it's like eight bucks for a slice of pizza, but Navidson-Monroe's footing the bill.\"",
            "I don't know what a food truck is. But if it's designed to move, and it has food in it, I assume it won't be around for long.",
            "\"And hey,\" Cody says. \"You have to be careful saying stuff like that.\"",
            "\"What do you mean?\" I ask, noticing his face flushes lightly now that we're out of the dark.",
            "\"You have a boyfriend. And yet you almost made me break our tenth rule.\"",
            " \"Then you must be weak,\" I tell him. \"Too weak for me,\" I say, though I feel refreshed by his sincerity. \"But that doesn't mean I can't help you.\""

            "\"It's when you were busy moping around behind the ration trucks,\" Katiya says, with a smug grin. \"But I didn't embarrass you too much.\"",

            "\"No, tell me,\" she says, leaning even closer, just as a voice chimes over the intercom, declaring we're at the first stop in Hearthland Ridge on Mineral Street. ",
            "The train car lurches to motion, and with her sweaty palms slipping against her bare thighs, her face crashes straight into my chest.",
            "But my mind is quick. \"Maybe it's because we just got here and you're already throwing yourself at me.\" I gently lift Kei up by her shoulders: despite my courageous words, I'm more afraid that she'll sense the swiftness of my heartbeat, and how badly I'm afraid of fucking this up.",
            "\"Oh, don't be so sure,\" she says. Her face flushes. \"I bought us the tickets, but that's only because I make big money compared to you!\"",
            "My mind is fast at this performance. I wonder when I stopped feeling the humor in the words. \"And you'll probably spend every last red cent of it on this date.\"  I find a smile. \"What is it? Another hundred dollars more than me?\"",
            "\"Who said this was a date?\"",
            "\"Please,\" I say. \"You said that, like, four sentences ago.\"",
            "\"Oh. I guess I did.\" She brushes several rebellious strands of her dense, dark hair behind her left ear. ",
            "We fix our eyes on the distant mountainscape. It's the only fixed point when residential houses, rusted refuse, and reckless weeds tear past us at a blistering speed. The only place we're allowed to look when too much eye contact with anyone on this train might mean a fight, or an impromptu Sunday sermon.",
            "But despite the courage it took to come back here, it feels like no time has passed. It's not just because she's wearing the same white-and-blue summer dress she wore all those summers ago. Nor is it because she's wearing the same perfume. I assume those two things are just because she's living at home with her parents, not because she's trying to imply something.",
            "Or is she? ",
            "No . . . I refuse to make that same mistake again. But I can feel the excitement of that anticipation as I watch her there, trying not to notice the curvature of her breasts change with each jostle of the cabin, nor the slenderness of her smooth legs lightly damp with sweat from a blistering June day. Not letting that animalistic side that wishes to skip all this overtake what I'm searching for — the one track of feeling that I'm afraid I lost.",
            "I try to notice if I notice anything that might show I still feel that way about her. Or that I still have it in me to feel about anyone. I try to remember when I almost said that four-letter word to her, right on the same platform where we boarded this train, before fear and diminishing time sealed that path off from me for years. ",
            "But that feeling isn't something you search for. It happens to you. It's a place you only realize once you're there, and I swear to God I have the emotional receipts to prove I was there.",
            "Our view of the Rocky Mountains is shaded by one of those big law firm ads that wraps around the train car, like looking through those bug-resistant screens that pixelate everything into a disparate spread of dots. Looking at the mountains makes me wonder how Katiya's date is going, hoping that she finds all the things she missed inside of Jullian. The silhouette of an image overshadows the entire car through the windows, but I can't see the full picture. I spend more time looking at how beautiful Kei is, accented with dots like the shading in a comic book, how little she's changed since the last time we were here, and wonder how much I've changed in ways that I don't even realize.",
            "I do small talk. ",
            "\"These windows are scratched to hell, huh?\"",
            "\"What?\" She asks, distracted like she is when I approach her with redlines, still mesmerized by the way everything tears past us.",
            "\"The windows. I thought I remembered the Denver Light Rail being a lot cleaner.\"",
            "\"Was it ever clean?\" She turns to me with her sapphire eyes. \"Cleaning this system up is like sculpting dry sand.\" And I realize this small talk is getting me nowhere.",
            "I feel that mindless feeling rise within me, dragging me closer to her. She leaned that far earlier for a reason. She's wearing this dress and that perfume for a reason. Maybe she meant to fall like that. ",
            "Or maybe she didn't. ",
            "And yet all I want is to just make a move.",
            "I look weird now, the way I'm bent over so far.",
            "\"You drop something?\" Kei asks.",
            "My heart seizes, still absorbed in her words from a day before. \"No, I just . . .\" and then I feel my body move in an act of fear, finding myself right next to her on the two-seater with our legs pressed together.",
            "Her skin is so pleasantly cool. The smell of her is overwhelming, and I feel that same part that led me to all those meaningless hook-ups in college urge me to move a little closer.",
            "But she's my colleague, I think. Didn't you learn last time that she doesn't see things that way?",
            "She's not moving away, keeping her position either because I made her vastly uncomfortable and she's stuck with me now, or because she's interested.",
            "But I don't want to assume. I don't want to lean on hope again.",
            "Her voice is warm. \"Took you long enough,\" she says, \"so is it realer now?\" ",
            "\"Sure,\" I say. The feeling engulfs me after all these lonely years. I venture my hand on her leg, and she returns by placing her hand on top of mine, leaning close so I can feel even more of her. ",
            "\"I guess we're right back where we started now, right? And yet you couldn't even ask on your own.\"",
            "\"Well, what can I say? You're a lot of things I like. You still make me hella nervous.\"",
            "\"Hella nervous? I can tell,\" she says, feeling a slight tremble in my hand. \"Is it still stressful dating an upperclassmen?\"",
            "\"There's no grades here anymore,\" I say.",

Meaningless hook-ups, lonely nights when my sorrow almost set me over the edge, and even though I long to relish the comfort of this exact moment, I'm so afraid of showing it. I'm afraid this feeling isn't what I want it to be, losing grasp of my ability to judge, falling headlong into that hedonistic sense of longing.",

It builds with the crescendo of all the unspoken questions: the useless questions that get us nowhere; the useless, pathetic questions that drive a larger wedge between us, preventing us from just enjoying things the way they are.",
            "What more can I want?",
            "The driver of this personal carriage is distracted by the noise of the horses. It's surely not his business to care, anyways: just to focus on our safe  passage from the Knights' Quarter of Gaffesend to the day spa in the springs. And as the carriage jostles us around on uneven terrain, I grab his shirt to pull him closer, stabilizing the two of us while the rest of the world trembles.",
            "I speak with my lips against his for every question that crosses my mind. The nostalgia of this love brings me back to the better times, when all we had to do was study, and not to serve our sentence on the brink of war. He tastes the same way he did all those years ago. And when I shift seats to sit next to him on the two-seater, with our legs pressed together, I find his skin so pleasantly warm, contrasting the cold of the alpine air.",
            "The smell of his musk is overwhelming: the Jullian smell in all the shirts he left behind. I feel that same part that led me to all those passionate nights in school urge me to move a little closer.",
            "But does he still feel that way? I ask. Why did he set this up for us?",
            "That same fear that keeps me from the scouting quests rhymes with the anxiety I feel now. I wonder if his kisses are just performative, because every time I pull away to collect my breath, it seems as if he wants to stop.",
            "\"What's wrong?\" I ask.",

            "\"I mean, how many OTHER drivers care about that? I'll bet you half the people they chaperone in small carriages like this  are couples. No storage on the top: most certainly unable to move a family. Designed for just a group of friends, or two lovers, on a day trip.\"",

I made sure to drink as much as I could when we went bowling, to loosen up a little, because even if alcohol makes me feel the call of the void the day after, I need to steal that emotional currency from my future self.",

Last time she beat me with her perfect technique, and just as she was about to beat me again, I gave up on trying to win, spinning the twelve-pounder with only two of my fingers in the holes. She laughed at my gutter balls, and when we played a round with the guards up, I wondered how Katiya would fair in a bowling match.",

            "\"I don't know,\" I say. \"I honestly think I was just trying to make you laugh.\"",
            "\"You always make me laugh,\" she says, but her eyes narrow. \"But, I don't know. It's felt like there's something different now.\"",

            "\"No,\" I say, still flashing a smile. \"It's alright.\"",
            "\"Well,\" She hesitates, but after another sip, finds it in her to finish. \"You know, ever since what happened. I've just felt this kind of sadness in you. Even when you laugh sometimes — and I'm not saying you don't laugh sincerely.\"",

            "\"But then what happened?\"",
            "\"I don't know. Then, I guess, the two quarters were up, and so was Senior Design. School was over, along with the drive, and now it collects dust in my garage.\"",

            "So I pack it in, smile, and add, \"But that past is over.\" Because it is. \"And my brother Jackie would want me to live on. I have to live enough for the both of us!\"",
            "But do I really have that spark left? Is she right? I wove this connection between Katiya and I — I mean, Kei and I, when I had that passion, but that weaving feels like a forgotten craft. All I have left are just the relics from that time that feel foreign to me: a song I forgot how to play, and all I know now is just how to improvise over it.",
            "I feel so drained of energy now, even dizzy. I anticipate those basic-bitch California rolls to absorb all the alcohol in my empty stomach, and I find I'm thinking of Katiya again, wondering what she's doing. It breaks my focus, causing my words to trail off as I grit my teeth and continue to recite even more of our past."

It's from the pain of how heavy-handed those backwater Ahkvasans are — digging their manicured claws into the thinnest muscles on our backs, extracting pain from our overworked muscles by dealing it. And now I'm tasked to withstand the freezing water for a couple minutes, because it's supposedly good for me.",

            "\"I think I'm already in the future I wanted,\" he says. \"And I hope tomorrow is just a continuation of that. Just the prospect of being free is enough: from all those awful years I never had the freedom to do anything. School, then training, then taking care of my brothers. Sleep for a while. Then repeat it all over again,\" he says.",
            "\"You met me in those years,\" I say, losing the feeling of ice.",
            "\"Oh. I mean, of course,\" he says. \"And you saved me from doing that forever. Could you imagine our lives if we weren't free like this? Boyhood was something I never had. And surely you'd admit that you didn't have a childhood either.\"",
            "\"I had a piece of one,\" I say. \"But what we have now is control. To steer our lives somewhere better. That after all the hard work and delayed gratification, we can reach something and call it ours. That thing we both wanted, remember?\"",

            "\"But what?\" I ask. \"What's changed?\"",
            "\"Nothing's changed. It's just—\" he starts, then lets out a long sigh. \"I remember being the oldest after both my brothers were born. And I remember school as the only time I had to enjoy myself. And my friends: Gavin and Auren, and how they'd keep inviting me to things, again and again, turning them down every time since I had to walk home and pick up my stupid siblings and feed them. While they got girlfriends, and they forgot about me, and got new friends, and . . .\" ",

            "\"Is what so wrong?\" I ask. \"You're not being specific, Jullian.\"",

            "\"To wish my father never died in the mining accident: to knock up my mother and leave me to care for them. Or to wish they were never born, and I could have enjoyed my life. Or if I can't go back there, then to change the present.\" But then he stops himself in his moment of passion. He recoils, frightened of his true nature for just a moment until his expression glazes over. \"Nevermind,\" he says.",
            "\"No. Finish the thought,\" I say, losing sense of the freezing water. \"What is it you wish for?\"",
            "\"For nothing,\" he insists. I can feel the anger and disappointment of all these months flood through me, but it can't come out of my mouth. I'm choking on it, like holding back the urge to vomit: the thought of the something that comes after those final words. It's the thought of oblivion. That with how things are going at training, that I'm headed for death anyways. That I don't have the time or the temerity or the looks or the emotional energy, and with all that fear, all I can do is keep holding it here.",

            "Inspired. Soulful. And as unpredictable as possible. ",
            "It was the way my instructors in the Northaven military academy told me to approach my combat: that there were only so many techniques they could teach us to commit to memory, that the artistry of the process would have to supersede the mechanics.",
            "But I was far from inspired or soulful when I woke up three hours ago: the first time in a while that the rapping of the knocker beat me to breakfast, causing me to rush through the motions of getting ready. I wore the odd undershirt that Cody gave me to find the slightest advantage when inspiration and soul feel unreachable — especially after the night before, when I sent Jullian home without any parting grant of affection.",
            "Now I stand in a shooting stall for a short interlude. Test three of four: a brief intermission between demonstrating acts of war. Strength and conditioning were easy because I can train both of them outside the base, avoiding the garrulous crowds that love to speak ill of the weak. And though I placed in the top percentage for each of them, it's the remaining tests that concern me the most. Especially the last one: because defending the innocent is the entire point of service as a Royal Guard.",
            "My finger hovers off the conductive plate of the aged IGR-4 Cinderjack rifle, a beast that's never seen war since it's spent most of its life collecting dust in the armory. I tuck my elbow to my chest, trying desperately to steady my trembling hand on the grip. My overwhelming concern for failure spills over the threshold of my mind, leaking its way into all my nerves and muscles. And the more the anger resists the trembling in my hands, tensing the tendons into a static position, the less control I find I have.",
            "My right hand impatiently waits on my left arm to steady the barrel of the Cinderjack. My eye stares directly downrange through the crosshairs at a disparate spread of punctured points in the paper, depicting the silhouette of a Chymaeran with its sickly, amethyst claws drawn. But not a single shot has hit the two-dimensional bastard in the head, between its triangle of eyes. Only two of the five shots I've taken have ripped the black ink on the parchment.",
            "The Essenced energy coalesces in my right index finger. I can feel the conductivity of the cold steel plate connected to the ignition chamber as my finger is drawn towards the metal, and when I lightly contact the combustion plate, transferring the Essence to incinerate the blasting powder, the round blasts through the rifle, startling me again, punching a sixth hole in the upper left corner of the page.",
            "I look around, expecting laughter, but the shooting range's bays are partitioned by thick steel blinders. Behind me is only the bag of gear I brought for all the exams. And when I look out across the span of twenty sheets, I'm the worst of all of them. ",
            "The guard next to me holds a tight spread of eleven shots that are damn-near heart center, surely the best out of everyone — and yet my hands tremble so much that I have to rest the rifle against the stand. I watch my rival's rifle protrude from the edge of the partition one last time to purge the mag of its twelfth and final round. ",
            "His barrel is steady. His aim is calculated. And when their finger conducts Essence through the Cinderjack, the rifle hardly jumps as a bullet hole erupts through the black on the page: completing a circle of holes so perfectly apportioned that it clips a single paper snowflake, excising the entire Chymaeran's chest.",
            "And then a set of long, black, manicured nails reaches for the rope of the pulley, dragging their disfigured parchment victim back to the firing line. And when it arrives, I raise my rifle in response, insecure about all the time I'm wasting. I fight the tremor I've had since the night of the fire, but just before I can begin to take aim, I feel a hand on my shoulder.",
            "\"Stop for a moment. You have to stop holding on so tightly.\"",
            "It's a female voice. And I realize that my rival isn't a man after all.",

She's trying to be helpful, but her words sound like ice, lacking any of the warmth that might comfort me. Yet her eyes light with some odd glimmer of excitement.",

For the final project, you gave that 'after-action' analysis on what should have happened during the Siege of Hillfar — and told the story of your survival.

            "\"Until then,\" I say, feeling far more unraveled than I did before.

            "The room is dimly lit, and so their seven silhouettes are hard to distinguish when the projector's lens burns the first slide into my retinas, reading CODY DUNSMORE, BATTERY SOLUTION across the Navidson-Monroe PowerPoint template. ",
            "The sixteen-point Arial text is just the right size in the center of the first slide. Two lines. It reads: CODY DUNSMORE, BATTERY SOLUTION. Four words, two per line. A perfect split, and it even makes a square with the words.",
            "I swallow. My voice catches in my throat as I can't decide whether to begin. The three unfamiliar envoys from Mahogany Row—far more used to their view from the ivory tower—are still busy typing an email, surely waiting for their Golden Boy to close it all out. But Nav watches closely, so instead of clearing my throat, I decide to proceed.",
            "I temper the excitement from my voice. \"After three years under the tutelage of senior engineers that have taught me everything about industry, I've come with a solution that I think will optimize ease of manufacturing,\" I say. \"I wanted to make something as simple as possible. No over-engineering. Just exactly what we need without any extra features.\" I realize I'm gesturing with my hands, and I stop myself as I depress the clicker.",
            "Click.",
            "The light flashes with a standard fade-to-black transition at 0.3 seconds. Several pairs of eyes dance across the next slide, taking in the intricacies of the preliminary engineering drawing. Five pairs of them, while two are still busy typing an email. ",
            "Sameshima squints with his glasses to read the enlarged engineering print. And after the criticisms over my last couple designs, I've managed to get it all on a single page.",
            "\"And it's all on a single page?\" Kei asks.",
            "\"A single page,\" I say.",
            "\"And there's no assembly?\" Nav asks.",
            "\"No assembly,\" I parrot. And I find there's a part of me that relishes the look of surprise when they see the reveal of how perfectly simplistic my design is. That unyielding glimmer of hope and excitement rises again: the one that gets me in trouble, dragged into a room a year ago by Nav to tell me that I talk too much.",
            "Their eyes dance over the page, snared on the ANSI callouts and the title block, and as the time passes, my mind pieces together a story of how I came to design it. That I saw a piece of origami on Sameshima's desk and had the idea to make a single part. That it hearkens back to designing the drone back in college. And how it brought back the best worst memories of being three energy drinks deep at 3:00 AM trying to resolve the very core of my entire design, and then I'd make a joke that—",
            "\"So, yeah, folds on an angle brake five times,\" I say, crushing the artistry of my work like stepping on an aluminum can. \"Nothing fancy. Entire pattern is laser-cut.\"",
            "\"So you're telling us that you managed to make this whole design a single part?\"",
            "Hell yeah, isn't it great? I think, but say, \"yeah. Reduces material cost and labor. Current design is three brackets to hold the battery.\" I gesture to the contours of the 3D view, trying not to reveal the sweat that's saturated my armpits. \"And in those lines there, there's a reference to where it mounts on the machine.\" I pull at my collar, feeling beads of sweat trickle down the back of my neck. \"Three holes. And this will cost even less than the three brackets it currently takes to make this.\"",
            "They sit with their mouths agape: my team, that is — except for the executives, that looked up to find that they have no idea what they're looking at. Maybe my team wants me to tell them more, to boast a little. I surely want to, but something restrains that fleeting feeling.",
            "\"This is great,\" Kei says. \"Seriously. It's incredible that you got this down to a single part!\" ",
            "And their reactions are real. For the first time in a while, even Nav looks impressed, while the executives look bored as hell.",
            "The electrical engineer Michael asks, \"what about mounting holes for the supply and ground of the battery wires?\"",
            "\"That's on the next slide.\" Click. \"I talked to our manufacturer, and they're able to emboss a flange for wire clips.\" A sweat drop rolls down my nose. I adjust my tie like Rodney Dangerfield, except I think I'm actually getting some respect, and Michael says, \"that's also really smart. So the techs don't have to deal with those stupid clips.\"",
            "\"Not at all,\" I say.",
            "\"But how about how it all goes together?\" Reed asks. I know he saw my slides before this, but he still looks captivated by the design. And despite our uncomfortable rivalry, it almost seems like he's posing the perfect question to lead me to the next slide.",
            "\"And that's why I have this to show you,\" I say.",
            "Click.",
            "A flash of black darkens the room for a split second, and on the next slide, an animation autoplays on the screen. Since something moves on the page, beyond pre-baked transitions and bullets of text, the executives look up from their computers. ",
            "And it's the part I'm most proud of, feeling a rise of anticipation as they react to what I designed from scratch.",
            "They all watch as my design folds perfectly into the shape from the first page, and from a flat pattern of laser-cut steel, the single piece folds from flower-like flanges into a bud as if it bloomed in reverse. The design was stolen from my past self — from all the suffering I went through alone, designing a lightweight drone chassis with an unemployed college student's scrappy budget.",
            "\"But how does it fold like that?\"",
            "\"Folds on an angle break,\" I say.",
            "\"And the holes are pre-drilled?\"",
            "\"No, cut from the laser, or water-jet.\"",
            "\"And what's it made of?\"",
            "\"Stainless steel.\"",
            "\"And how can the technicians mount it?\"",
            "\"Through the relief cuts. Quarter-twenty screws like the last design.\"",
            "I want to believe I've finally got it when I scan their faces. Maybe this time I can let that fleeting feeling wash over me, relishing in their response when I'm not wasting my talent on those stupid redlines. ",
            "I feel like I did all those years ago when I presented the drone project. I remember that sliver of happiness between the brutal beatings of exams and class, and I almost think that back then I was happy for the first time since Jackson died, the way these fleeting moments rhyme.",
            "But then an executive closes his laptop, leaning with his elbows on the steel cover. \"That's great and all, Cory, but who would want to buy this?\"",
            "My heart pulses. I nearly drop the clicker. ",
            "\"What do you mean?\" I ask.",
            "\"I mean, it looks so plain,\" he says. \"Look. Our customers want something sleek. Functionality is fine and all, but marketability is what moves units.\"",
            "\"Plain? This is—\" a fucking bracket, I think, but I halt the words.",
            "\"I mean, it has to be sellable,\" he says. \"We'll send out a tech bulletin with this part, and no offense, but aren't their eyes going to glaze over if they see this? I don't mean to be harsh, but what makes it stand out?\"",
            "I squint my eyes, and through the blinding rays I find it's the man that gave Reed the box of \"new guy\" donuts to share on his first day. I stutter over my words. I look to my team for that same sense of wonder, but they're silent: too tense about layoffs to argue with the Grim Reaper.",
            "But Kei speaks up. \"I think it's brilliant,\" Kei says. \"One sheet of steel? Minimal setups for the ones making it, as long as they hold down the center of the flat pattern?\" She points, \"look, he even considered that. It mounts right there with a cap screw.\"",
            "Two more beads of sweat saturate my brow. I try to forestall the feeling of anger I feel: these executives' knowledge of our operations is shallower than a piss puddle; more pedestrian than a preschooler. And after all this effort — to present something in EXACTLY the way they've molded me since the beginning, all I feel is a sense of betrayal.",
            "But it's not the only sense of betrayal.",
            "The executive continues, \"I mean, what do you think, Naveen?\"",
            "He looks nervous, resisting his genuine sense of awe as he contorts his face into a grimace. \"It's . . . I mean, I guess I can see some of that.\" He points to the engineering drawing on the screen, but he can't even meet my eyes. \"Cody, who told you to make the corners so sharp on those bends?\"",
            "\"I figured they would be close to ninety degrees, if it's in a steel brake,\" I say.",
            "\"You figured?\" He asks.",
            "\"Yeah,\" I say. \"I mean, this is just an early—\"",
            "\"But did you talk to anyone?\"",
            "\"Yeah.\" A familiar fear settles in my stomach. This will end just like all the others. \"I, uh . . . talked to my father about it. It's how I got the fasteners to be accessible.\"",
            "\"But anyone else?\"",
            "\"Not really,\" I say. The truth is I didn't want to bother anyone. I don't want to be lectured even more when I can swear I know my worth. And I wanted to surprise them: just to catch that moment I had before.",
            "\"And the metal thickness isn't even CE compliant,\" Nav says. \"One-eighth? I mean, if you previewed this to any one of us, we'd be able to tell you that.\"",
            "\"We told Reed that,\" Michael says.",
            "\"This is just a prototype,\" I say.",
            "The other executive says, \"It might be a prototype, but what's our company's motto? What's the second pillar of the House Of Quality?\"",
            "\"Built by precision,\" I regurgitate.",
            "\"And precision means getting things right,\" he says. The chair squeaks when he leans back. \"Getting things right the first time. And what about the third pillar?\"",
            "\"Rely on others.\"",
            "Nav speaks up again. The point is to show your process. We don't do this work alone, and newer engineers should ask for advice.\" And then he adds, \"Like Reed.\"",
            "I want to tell them I wasn't trying to work alone. I want to tell them that I was excited to see their reactions from the moment I considered this, challenging myself to get this down to a single part and pulling through in the end. But all I can do is stand there and take it — like being a pledge in the fraternity again, bludgeoned by broken rules when my works should at least be acknowledged.",
            "At least someone seems to get it. While the others are stone-faced and unwilling to defend me, I find an unlikely voice of dissent. ",
            "Reed balls his fists on the table, but still waits his turn to speak. \"I thought Cody's folding concept was incredible! Mine uses far more parts than his does. And it's heavier. And it's bulkier. And yet Cody rolled out this design as if—\"",
            "The executive says, \"but Reed, you asked the whole damn department for their input. So this is everyone's design.\"",
            "Reed purses his lips, and an awkward silence spans the lineup of this unwitting firing squad. The projector whirs overhead. We can even hear the clattering of tools, machines, and raucous chatter behind us, as I wait for someone — anyone else — to speak up. But it's not a friend: there never seems to be anyone in my corner here.",
            "\"I think we agree that the problem with your design is that you didn't ask for help,\" one of Reed's visitors says. \"The problem is that you came up with this, and you didn't ask for help. Or else these issues wouldn't be there.\" Another silence as the projector whirs overhead. \"But I like the folding thing. And the animation on the second slide. Folds like origami.\"",
            "Another silence.",
            "He says, \"do you have any other slides for us?\"",
            "The unfolding box plays over and over on the screen as a GIF: my presentation was only four slides by design.",
            "\"That's it,\" I say. \"I was trying to keep things concise, not over-explain.\"",
            "\"Concise? How long did you spend on this?\" He asks, scribbling something on his empty pad.",
            "\"Weeks,\" I say.",
            "\"Weeks?\"",
            "I turn my head away. Through the shades of the back window, I can see the glowing reflectors of the Aerospace building, and maybe it gives me just enough to reply.",
            "\"Yeah. Weeks,\" I say. \"I thought you wanted something . . . optimized, you know. Inexpensive. And simple.\"",
            "\"I think it's simply great,\" Wilbur says, with enough years and irreplaceable knowledge to say whatever the hell he wants. \"Cody, you did a great job, and this is really impressive.\"",
            "I smile. \"Thanks, Wilbur.\"",
            "\"No wonder I still have a lot to learn,\" Reed says.",
            "I smile. \"Thanks, Reed.\"",
            "\"Nice,\" Kei says.",
            "I smile. \"Thanks, Kei.\"",
            "I turn to Nav, to Michael, to anyone else, but they're still as cardstock.",
            "Another silence.",
            "I press my thumb against the clicker, and after a final flash of darkness, a blank slide says QUESTIONS. But I'm sure I know their answer.",
            "\"Thanks for your feedback. I'll look over all that again. Wall thickness. CE compliance. Bend angle,\" I mutter, pulling the HDMI cord from the side of my machine, returning the room to darkness as Reed recircles to plug in his.",
            "The screen lights with a bright and colorful presentation, bathing the walls in a mirage of hues like the northern lights: certainly not the standard template from the folder. And as he opens his mouth with a smile, he delivers his first, rehearsed line, with such a naive and enviable spark of genuine excitement."

For a while, our two strike teams were neck-and-neck as we dispersed across the diamond shape of the battlefield, but now we no longer catch flashes of crimson between the narrow alleys. Either they're ahead us or behind us, but either way, I feel the anticipation rise for Pax's flare.",

            "Another blast echoes through the air. My body lunges for the nearest alley, but Bertram's strong grasp prevents me from escaping. And for the first time, I see his infinite patience with my trauma begin to crumble.",

            "I peek out of the corner, sighting the adversary that's reloading the rifle, then pull the trigger. My first round misses, and I dive behind the corner of the alley while Bertram's disappointed glare propels this self-hate to unprecedented heights. ",
            "I groan again, cursing myself as I rack another round. Something slams against the other side of the wall, casting a cloud of blue dust into the air, and in the space that Bertram's killer takes to reload, I raise my weapon, steadied with my shoulder against the corner of the wall.",

            "Fight defaults to flight, but at least I'm running, fueled wholly on disappointment as I draw my dagger, putting the two insurgents behind me: exactly where I don't want them.",
            "The intended action point is approaching, and at least my conditioning can get me there fast in this heavy armor: all I've ever done my whole life is run. I hear the blasts echo from behind, running in a zig-zag pattern like a hare evading the jaws of a predator. Blue chalk accents the walls to the left and right. Aryn shouts something else, but I'm unable to hear her when my heartbeat pounds in my ears, drawing raspy breaths that taste like poison as the breach point approaches.",
            "But then Pax's radiant signal launches into the air, followed by a loud pop. I'm still running, exhausted; mind racing too fast to respond quickly when I blast through the door; heart racing too rapidly to catch a breath before I breach.",
            "And it fires straight up into the air.",
            "This was a plan based on time, and my fear has left me behind. Expecting Bertram and I to be waiting on the other side, I hear a crash as Naya and Ryder bludgeon their way through the far door, and a long five seconds later, I finally find the wall where Bertram and I should have been waiting.",
            "Several blasts echo between the walls as Aldrin's searchlight illuminates the entire footprint of the roofless building. I lower my shoulder to breach through the door, entirely unprepared for what I find waiting for me on the other side."

            "Reed's entirely prepared as he advances towards his last slide. In the lower corner, it reads 20 OF 20: even with a custom progress bar to show the stages of his presentation.",
            "\"And, again, here's a full view of my assembly,\" he says. \"Not animated in that cool way like Cody's, but I've colored each of the parts.\" Each of the five parts: two more than the current design already uses. And although his design looks really cool—with even the company logo laser-etched into one of the faces- the design doesn't have a single sharp edge, defaulting to the rounds called fillets that are a bitch-and-a-half for machinists.",
            "But this is everybody's design, according to Naveen. I watch his expression twist in all the ways it did during the presentations I gave in my first year, calling out impossible corners and stress concentrations. But he's been silent this whole time, along with all the others.",
            "\"This is my first effort in designing something here,\" Reed says, putting his hands together in a prayer-like gesture. \"I'm new to this, and I want to humble myself before the process, though I can't tell you how excited I was to present my ideas.\"",
            "\"I like how the L-brackets save on cost. Going for what already exists, just like I told you,\" Sameshima says.",
            "Michael adds, \"and the holes for mounting wires.\"",
            "Nav adds, \"and you got the metal gauge down to the right width.",
            "I feel like I'm expected to praise him, too. \"And you used the material I recommended. It'll definitely be lightweight with Aluminum.\"",
            "\"Please,\" Reed says. \"Not as light as a single piece of sheet metal.\"",
            "\"Well, you did well,\" Naveen says. \"It's the best first presentation I've seen.\" Yet with that familiar expression, it looks like he has something else hr wants to say.",
            "But what? I think. The egregious number of fillets? The oversized mounting screws that could hold up one of our airplanes? The cuts that don't contribute anything? The laser etching somewhere a laser couldn't reach? The surface finish? The stacked tolerances? The unmarked dimensions? The fact that this thing is over-engineered so evidently for aesthetics over function?",
            "\"What is it, Cody?\" Nav asks.",
            "I realize they're all looking at me. Maybe my face made some stupid contortion. \"Nothing.\" They draw the silence out longer, and I try to offer the most meager critique. \"I thought this was a design review. Shouldn't we be, uh . . . critiquing each other evenly?\"",
            "They stare at me, blankly. I spent the whole presentation obsessed in watching them react, and as someone who's fielded more criticism than an intern, I can see it in their faces.",
            "Reed's father's friend replies. \"Well, I don't know. I think Reed got all that out when he asked the whole damn company,\" he says, followed with a corporate laugh that all the others try to mimic.",
            "I look down at my sheet of paper. It's still vastly overcrowded with criticisms I jotted down for myself than ones for Reed, but I feel something inside usher the words without being able to stop them. My pen taps the first one. \"Nav, you told me that the angles on my design were too sharp. But what about the ones on those two parts,\" I gesture, \"over there?\"",
            "Nav looks pissed all of a sudden. \"This isn't about me, Cody. But sure, I can see that?\"",
            "I tap another bullet point on my sheet. \"And what about the screws? They might be oversized for the application. I remember Sameshima once told me to keep from doing that.He gave me one of his design charts.\"",
            "\"That's a good point,\" Reed says, jotting it down.",
            "I think my words might usher other obvious criticisms, but from the way the executives glare at me, I find the rest of the room is still silent, but something inside urges me to keep going. \"And the fillets. Kei told me once to keep them to a minimum, only for stress concentrations. Don't get me wrong, your design looks fantastic and is more serviceable than mine, but you might want to . . . dial it back a little?\"",
            "Reed jots it down: not offended, not upset, but professional, yet it's the other lifelong corporate dregs that have an issue.",
            "\"All I've heard is the ways that the others have criticized you, Cory,\" the executive says. \"If you're so good at taking criticism, then why can't you be a good employee and ask for it?\"",
            "I ball my fists as my face flushes with heat, barely able to keep my composure as I think I'll snap the steel drafting pencil in my grasp. It takes everything to level my voice flatter than the landscape below the mountains — the view these pencil-pushing fucks take for granted while they take the elevator to get down here.",
            "\"There just hasn't been any criticism yet. And I had a couple things to share.\"",
            "I see Naveen catch a glance at my reddening face with sympathy. He knows what's really going on. But like everyone else here, the coward insists on just playing his corporate game: the game our new hire seems to be miles ahead of me on.",
            "I look around, pleading for anyone to stand up for me before my emotions push me to an early professional grave.",
            "\"Reed,\" the executive says, \"you've done a great job. It's no wonder you're on the wall of future talent.\"",
            "A cloud shades the landscape beyond the glass, casting the bright reflection from the solar arrays in shadow. And then the words leave my mouth before I have the wherewithal to form them.",
            "The entire room is stunned for a second. Even the executives are surprised.",
            "\"Excuse me?\"",
            "\"I said, three years of busting my ass here, but it was never about the work, was it?\" I parrot.",
            "And at least it's my own words I'm repeating this time. ",
            "\"People like you stroll around the shop and design floor like you have your fingers on the pulse of the company, but you don't know anything about design. I didn't ask anyone for help — you know why? Because I've had three and a half years of critique to hone my works, and I've listened to every word.\" I feel myself stand, no longer trembling with fear. \"I've remembered, and recorded, and meticulously followed the script for as long as I can remember — only to have my boss critique me on the exact things he instructed me to change!\"",
            "Nav looks terrified. The rest of them are too afraid to argue as I crumple my page of notes in my hands. ",
            "Nav mutters, \"Cody, you need to—\"",
            "\"You know how long three-and-a-half years is? To someone that's dreamed of this company since they were a child in Hearthland Ridge?\" Their expressions change ever-so-slightly from anger to something else. Because I have something other than just some short temper. I turn to Reed, and he looks sympathetic, so I spare him. \"You're going to be a great engineer, Reed. I know it. But I don't have a golden spoon up my ass like you do, and I don't have a sympathetic audience to turn their words in my favor.\" I rip the badge from the retractable reel on my work pants. Work pants that my shirt was actually tucked in to, because I hoped that today would be different, because I let that stupid feeling inform my actions again. \"If you're not going to give me a fair shot, and if the only thing that matters is who I know, then why the hell am I even here?\"",
            "The silence is thick. The fear still furrows their faces, and as I'm about to turn, I find an unlikely voice in the struggle.",
            "Reed taps his pencil against the lectern. \"Cody's points are valid. I mean, his idea is way better—\"",
            "\"Get him out of here,\" the executives say.",
            "\"Enough, Reed,\" Nav says: the guy who's supposed to impress his superiors by how he cracks the whip. \"Cody, that's enough! Go cool down. We'll be having a one-on-one after this.\"",
            "I nod. Then I awkwardly return to the front of the room: grabbing my work laptop and the crumpled page with all the criticisms I intended to take to heart.",
            "My hand falters. My fingers kick the page on the floor, so I have to go around an embankment of three desks in humiliation as I grasp the crumpled ball of graph paper, feeling the horror wash over me like the guys in the control room during the Cuban Missile Crisis: entirely aware of how my future trajectory might have irreversibly shifted.",
            "\"I'm sorry. I just—\" I manage, but the stream of tears beats the words as I turn away to hide them,  rushing down the hall and out the door, debating whether I have a desk to return to."

            "If I don't act now, I won't have a home to return to. When my shoulder bludgeons open the door to the roofless, charred edifice, it is not an act of courage, but the response of a frightened girl that can't resist the currents of fear.",
            "I flow like water from the heights of terror to the lowest point of controlled panic: just an autonomous reaction, and I rue the fact that I haven't the mental space for clever and quickness. My trembling hand grasps the chalked wooden dagger from the holster on my chest, trying to mask my heaving breaths of exertion as Aldrin's beam animates the shadows between the cracks of the uneven cobblestone walls.",
            "Rifles aren't allowed in close quarters, so I'm prepared to pounce on anyone. Last time I had the upper hand with Cody — and a window to watch him stumble through the foyer first — but here, I'm met with an uncomfortable silence, more unsettled by my adversaries outside the walls than the contents of this flame-lashed footprint.",
            "I check the corners, ready to strike at the slightest provocation: my grasp on the dagger tense but unsteady. Maybe they were in the North Wing, where Naya and Ryder breached. All that commotion — could it already be over? And when I press through the center of the space, squinting my eyes as I try to distinguish the features through dusk, the western door bludgeons open, casting me to the floor.",
            "Paxton looks twice his size when he tenses all his muscles, and though the searchlight meandered in the east, it quickly snaps back to the blue team's house after I lift myself from the floor.",
            "\"Where are they?\" Pax says: his hands ice his grasp on the sword with the same power that stacked shot glasses in the tavern. \"I heard commotion, and then nothing: what's happening?\"",
            "And then another figure emerges from the north: impossibly silent on her feet.",
            "\"It was Ryder and I,\" Naya says. \"We managed to take out two of them, but Ryder was killed.\"",
            "\"Where the Res were you, Katiya?\" Paxton asks. \"You were late!\"",

            "\"We were ambushed. Bertram and I. We tried to put up a fight—\"",
            "\"But where are they?\" Pax asks. \"Where are the hostages?\"",
            "Naya says, \"we went right while Bertram and Katiya went left. And Paxton went around.\"",
            "The only conclusion left is preposterous. \"That's an incredible wager,\" I say. \"You're telling me...\"",
            "\"If they get to the red flag, it's over!\" Paxton shouts, retrieving the training rifle from his back. \"We need to rush them!\"",
            "And just then, the blue team's flare takes its turn illuminating the battlefield.",
            "\"They have the advantage — what's happening?\" Naya asks, her tail frayed with apprehension. \"It's three versus three, and they have a straight shot to victory.\"",
            "\"They're not going for an easy victory. Aryn isn't going to leave any of us alive,\" I say.",
            "The blue flare feathers out, leaving us in the wake of its ambient glow. \"So what are we going to do?\" Paxton asks. \"Whatever they're doing, they're doing!\" They turn to me: our two other confident tacticians are dead.",
            "I idle. \"But how did they get around?\" I ask.",
            "\"It doesn't matter. Get to the windows,\" Pax says, and shamefully, I begin to untie the bandanna from my head.",
            "\"Stop,\" Naya says, grasping my hand with her claws. \"There's no time to denigrate yourself.\" And then the quiet one gives me orders. \"Get to the center window.\"",
            "\"Alright,\" I say, resting the barrel of the red-powder rifle against what remains of the windowsill. We hear the thunder of rocks resounding against any metallic surface. The three sound like an army of hundreds coming to cleanse us from this battlefield, and as I sit at the window, I can't help but feel like that same petrified girl that once listened at the window, until one day her nightmare came true.",
            "And, just then, I hear a blast from the south.",
            "\"I got one,\" Naya exclaims, but just as she's about to turn to face me, a loud blast from beyond powders her spotted fur with blue dust, casting her towards the wall away from the window.",
            "The clatter of stones and pebbles accelerates like a hailstorm of bullets against steel, brass, and bronze, as if the Gods themselves cast their judgement on my cowardice from above. The maddening, raucous clatter crescendoes as Paxton takes up arms at the rear windowsill.",
            "\"They're behind us!\" He shouts. A round rips through his window, decorating the back wall with blue powder that darkens from the cloud of ash and dust, only inches from my head. \"Run for the red flag, Katiya, it's the only way you can save this. Touch the hostages. Save our—\"",
            "He takes a round to the chest, and it hardly staggers him. Two more crackle off his chest armor, and before my mind can interpret the death of my last misled comrade, I leap through the window, evading a maelstrom of blue-powder rounds as I fire blindly, decorating the sky and ground and walls with red.",
            "I'm running down the same thoroughfare as the weakening reflection of Aldrin's eyeglass observes me. There is no space for reason when my heart is in my throat, along with my lungs, and running straight for the front with my rifle leveled, I feel myself pull the trigger at the first figure that emerges from the corner.",
            "The figure crumples, falling to the ground as they wheeze, grasping their unarmored chest. Aldrin's reflection catches the bright green linen they're wearing, with a thick weave of gambeson armor on the top.",
            "\"Hostage down,\" Aldrin exclaims, and riding the fumes of bitter resentment, my mind concludes the rest of the hostages are around the corner. ",
            "The rounds keep whizzing, grazing, and missing, displacing the air around me, not a single one contacting me loll as I turn the corner to touch as many hostages as I can.",
            "But instead, I touch the cool breastplate of a soldier: one that lashes me to the ground with the wide face of her broadsword.",
            "\"You will never save anyone if you're always the last to respond, Katiya,\" Aryn says, glaring down at me with her piercing, slitted azure eyes. She raises her hand to stop the others from claiming victory prematurely, granting me the clemency to lift myself from the ground. And as my body crumples on another episode of public mortification, Aryn remains still and absolute, speaking with a voice and expression like one of Cody's automatons.",
            "\"Prove yourself to me. Prove to all of us that you're better than you act,\" Aryn says, as Jullian steps from behind her, unable to bring himself to look at me again. \"Fight me,\" she says: \"fight me and regain your honor!\"",
            "She takes a slash at me with the training sword at full force, and I deflect with the dagger in my left hand, barely able to catch her rounded edge with the hilt.",
            "My other hand withdraws the light, wooden sword from its sheath. The rest of the world fades to darkness as the sun sets behind the Purgatory Mountains, leaving only the searchlight that sketches a circle in the street.",
            "The dead approach from both sides, saturated in homogenous purple: the victims from the blue team; Bertram and Ryder and Naya and Pax; and the other active blue-team soldiers with their weapons still drawn.",
            "\"Show me you deserve to be here,\" she says. \"That you deserve Jullian. That you deserve a key and a home. That your presence isn't just an insult to all the ones that didn't make it!\" She hammers me with blows on every line, driving me further away from the trembling ring of light. My wordless rebuttal only lies in blocking her sword, as amethyst dust clouds the air. Every assault comes at full force in a furious flurry of slashes, without the inefficiency of hesitation. ",
            "Every strike is another scene that plays within: every evasion of the base; every quest spent meandering around the city; every time I turned down my friends that only wished to challenge me from a place of love. ",
            "I'm driven further out of the ring: to a premature death, towards my colleagues that cower in secondhand shame. ",
            "But in her mechanical string of attacks is an absence of variation. ",
            "It's a pattern. ",
            "Like the pistons of touring cars, her strokes land all the same, and when I draw on the flood of emotion that immolates me from within, I find the faintest opening. ",
            "A creative force of Essenced energy flushes my circuits with one last spark of intention. The maroon dust clouds shimmer with notes of blasting powder. Between blows as I'm drawn to the absolute edge, I let my hands scald with the energy of life and fire. And when she lunges for a final blow, I ignite the air and dive behind her, closing my eyes as the blinding flash stuns her.",
            "I level my sword to strike, catching her in an unprecedented moment of weakness. I turn to face Aron as she reflexively wipes her eyes, my strike committed and absolute, but just as I'm about to deal Aryn's death, a close-range slug of blue powder explodes against my back, sending me directly in to her as we both sprawl outside the circle.",
            "\"Drill is over,\" Aldrin shouts. \"Blue defenders win four-to one.\" ",
            "I turn my head to find the rule-breaker that blasted me at close range, and I find Jullian standing there. Maybe his glance is one of pity, or maybe it's fear. Or maybe it's relief — from how his jealousy resists any motion I make towards redemption.",
            "My body lacks the strength to stand up, but Aryn finds her footing. She hesitates to extend a hand, offering one last string of words before Jullian braces her, taking her arm over his shoulder as another one of her teammates approaches.",
            "\"You will never save anyone like this, Katiya,\" she says. \"You're worse than Rayna. And you'll die faster than she did.\"",
            "\"I saved Rayna,\" I mutter, but it's too quiet for her to hear. ",
            "\"You will always be a victim,\" Aryn says. \"And to think you were my inspiration.\"",
            "Bertram and Paxton lift me by the arms as Ryder draws the Essence to mend my minor scrapes. I hear Aldrin's voice call for me to approach overhead as they carry me towards the wooden elevator, grasping the railing as they pull me from the battlefield to become an observer of the grand map.",
            "\"I'm not sure why you chose to wear that headband,\" Aldrin says.",
            "\"I had a plan,\" I tell him. \"I had a great plan.\"",
            "\"But you were late! You cowered, and hid, and had Bertram here dragging you like he is just now. You're a casualty. A piece of twine that guises as a steel link in the chain,\" he spits, \"and a leader that waits until it's safe. Leaders don't wait!\"",
            "\"I . . . but I —\"",
            "\"I've given you so much leeway, Katiya. You have talent, but Gods be damned, why are you even here?\"",
            "I choke back tears to withdraw the words. \"Because I have a dream,\" I say. \"I had a dream. To save someone. To save anyone. To make my family's death and all that pain mean something! Or else . . . \"",
            "\"Well, you're below the line, Katiya,\" Aldrin says. \"The first one this term. And I KNOW you have it in you.\"",
            "\"Yes, sir.\"",
            "\"I need to see a whole success from you, from start to finish. No hesitation!\"",

            "\"Yes, sir\" I add.",
            "\"And here.\" He withdraws a small envelope from a folder, extending it to me. \"You haven't been to the mail room in ages. This has been sitting there for a while. You've got a letter from your family: hopefully it can act as motivation.\"",
            "Maybe it's just another check-in card, another undeserved pulse of praise from afar.  But I quickly realize it's something substantive from the weight.",

            "Sometimes this numbness can be a blessing in the same way that it's a curse. ",
            "It's a curse that makes tearful graduation speeches from my father sound like lectures from a professor. It makes moments of intimacy with the woman I thought I I'd end up with feel like a meaningless hookup. But in moments of toleration — whether it's the long, dragging pledge process, an hour-and-a-half waiting for a new license at the DMV, or the verbal lashing I received from Naveen — the curse can be a blessing. ",
            "I observed myself from the corner of the room just like I do in every situation, fully detached from the experience like I'm reading my own story, like the words are already written on the page and I'm anticipating what comes next.",
            "All I know is that I'm not getting fired. I've spent most of this car ride home just trying to locate the debris inside me, thumbing through flesh for the fragments from my explosion.",
            "But I don't think anything is there.",
            "Either my soul is too calloused, or its affects phased right through me, just like all the other acts of love when feeling and setting aren't aligned by chance.",
            "Cody was sitting in the dimly-lit room with the shades drawn. He was called in there from his desk by his boss, before the others could return from the meeting. He was certain he was being fired, but he found the strangest sense of relief in the idea of starting from scratch, no matter the pain of what that process entailed, or the dangers of that mortgage for the interdimensional house he took out in his name.",
            "But he quickly found that the lashing almost felt like a formality. ",
            "The punches felt they were being driven by something else: weak and auxiliary, like catching blows from a marionette. Naveen said the leadership decided to go with Reed's design, and despite all the effort he put into it, channeling everything he learned only to be told to discard everything he learned, he realized that all he could do was just ride out the slow swell of mediocrity.",
            "Maybe Reed really is better than me. Maybe Kei really does deserve someone better. And maybe all that someone like me can aspire to is just to mull around designing batteries and fixtures for the rest of my life.",
            "Maybe I am that second type of engineer, I think to myself. Maybe I'm the type that digs a foxhole into a single forgotten field, while the rare few are able to ride their passion. Have I ever been passionate? Why did I even choose this in the first place?",
            "All I know is that the anger is still there. It's hot and uncomfortable, and when my foot sinks the pedal to the floor, apathetic to that pointless, abandoned light at the bottom of the hill, I blast directly through the red without any observers. I pound the wheel. I scream as loud as I possibly can with the windows down and the wind at eighty miles per hour and climbing rushing past my face, shouting obscenities and trying to let it out though the discomfort is still there, thinking that if I coax it out by going through the motions of people who feel, that I might find its release.",
            "But all I have is speed, and the feeling of inertia when the car jostles over the uneven hill before the highway, forcing me to slam my brakes so I don't flip off the on-ramp. My fingers tension the rubber wheel, ruing this feeling of internal anguish and the fear of what comes after when I return to the office. Maybe the enclosure design failed for bureaucratic reasons, but I still have the battery project. And maybe I just have to impress them so much that they can't help but promote me: to acknowledge the talent I KNOW I have inside me.",
            "But no. That's the feeling of hope again. ",
            "Maybe I all I have is just to do it at minimal effort, and pass time like all the others in my company that settled early."

            "Cody pulls in the garage a little after 17:30. I hope it's excitement that brought him home so quickly: maybe to relay the news, that the presentation gave him everything he ever wanted. I was happy to be a spectator for his rehearsal this morning, though I wasn't listening to a word of it. It wasn't because I didn't care. It was less because I didn't understand, and more from rising panic over the demands of my competency test.",
            "I couldn't stand to stand or sit or lie down in my own home, to relish in so much as a square cubit of undeserved space. It felt as if the ground might vanish beneath me if I put too much weight on it, and thusly, I retreated past the threshold to rest in the calmness of Cody's world.",
            "I sit on his couch in comfort clothes that he gave me a couple weeks ago: cozy pajama pants in a strange black-and-red pattern that Cody tells me is reminiscent of tree-cutters — called jacks of lumber or something — and a thin, cotton shirt that's tight around the chest, reading SHALEBOROUGH RENAISSANCE FAIRE. With nothing but time to waste, I try to thumb through the device he got me, wondering how it could fit all the literature of his world in so small a space.",
            "The garage closes. And the door bursts open as if he were kicking it for a breaching drill. His face is red, and his eyes are red, but it doesn't look like he was crying. The crescents of his eyes are worn deeper than I've ever seen them, unshouldering his bag pack as he covers his face with his hands, letting out a loud exhale.",
            "\"So what happened?\" I ask: it's what asked me when my world first fell apart.",
            "\"Everything,\" he mutters. I watch his body sink onto one of the barstools. Then he settles for the floor, crumpled with his head resting in his hands.  \"I'm pretty sure I lost everything,\" he says, \"or I lost everything at the start, and only now, I'm realizing what's gone.\"",
            "He's distraught, but I find a strength in his weakness that's entirely absent from my world. A strength to lose races for friendship. To make jokes. To bleed publicly. And despite the anguish of all my shortcomings, I find the overwhelming desire to do nothing but protect him: because I think he's the only person I've met who understands.",
            "And I try, one last time, to draw out those feelings from within myself.",
            "I rise from the couch to join him on the floor. \"I wonder which of us had it worse,\" I say.",
            "\"I found out my company doesn't need me,\" he says, and instead of heaving breaths that will surely lead him to a panic attack, the sentence provides enough pause to slow his breathing.",
            "The thought of Jullian makes me hesitate to touch him: maybe it's because of the fear of being hurt; that I'm still trying to reconcile how something so great can devolve into apathy. The rules are still taped to the door: the last one circled several times in impossibly bright yellow ink.",
            "\"I found out that my 'company' might be better without me, too,\" I say, focusing my eyes on his face until he decides to turn and face me, but he still hides with his head in his hands: ears red with tufts of short brown hair displaced by his fingers.",
            "I want so badly to touch him.",
            "\"And what did you do?\" He asks.",
            "\"I failed an examination. A very critical one. They said I was too weak. That I'll never save anyone. And then I lost to my rival in a humiliating way,\" I say, and I sniffle.",
            "\"They showed me that I'll never be good enough. All they care about is the ones that play the game. But I had a shit hand to start,\" Cody says. \"So my dad is a technician? The union are just scabs for corporate guys to pick off one by one.\"",
            "\"And weakness of any kind is a malady. And my past keeps getting in the way,\" I tell him. My head sinks slowly until it's about to rest on his shoulder.",
            "\"At least you had a chance to fight,\" Cody says. \"My struggle was fixed from the start.\"",
            "\"Oh, please. At least you didn't have to fight with your fists,\" I say.",
            "\"Fight?\" It's the first time he flashes his dark brown eyes at me. \"Violence isn't the only incisive way to shred a person's soul. I spent three years trying day-in and day-out.\"",
            "\"And I tried just like you,\" I say, sternly, discomforted by a new hole for my anger that I haven't the time to suture shut. I know what he means, but the words leave anyway. \"What, you think it's all just in my head?\"",
            "\"In your head? What are you talking about? Your struggle is actual violence. I'm just saying professional death can hurt, too,\" he says, slowly sliding away from me.",
            "\"I never said it couldn't,\" I say.",
            "\"I know. I'm just saying you have the agency to change things. To choose what image you fight for,\" Cody says, \"but . . .\"",
            "\"So you are saying it's all in my head!\" I exclaim, rising from the floor to look down on him. \"Tell me, is your family dead? Were you the victim of unfathomable violence that scarred you in places you'll never be able to find?\"",
            "\"No,\" Cody says, standing up as he backs against the icebox, nearly tripping over his bag. \"I'm sorry, Katiya, I misspoke. I mean that—\"",
            "\"You weren't even there when your brother died. He's more of a warrior in any sense than you'll ever be,\" I hear myself say, balling my fists until my nails might break the flesh on my palms, and I feel the unfairness of all the world exit my mind wholly through the keyhole of my mouth. \"How do you get better at sitting in a box?\"",
            "\"Fuck you,\" he says. \"What are you going to do, Wonder Woman? Stab me again?\" He pushes a buttering knife across the counter, confident enough to know I won't use it.",
            "A sliver of me relents for an apology, for how messed up the words are that left my mouth. I piece together the first words to even begin to tell Cody that I'm sorry, to try to mend this, because I feel a different feeling still drawing me closer to him, almost strong enough to overcome the white hot rage.",
            "Cody says, \"Your father died before he could teach you how to chill the fuck out. And that's not my goddamned fault.\"",
            "\"At least I try,\" I say. \"You don't even try at all! You're a coward, so struck by a death you didn't even witness that you give yourself permission—\"",
            "\"—and all you do is no different,\" Cody says. \"They were right. You won't save anyone if you can't even leave your town!\"",
            "The knife on the counter tempts me. But it's the other unfamiliar feeling that tempers me. \"This was a mistake to ever think I could depend on you,\" I tell him. I tear the power cord from the wall, tugging and tugging and tugging it from my world along with the meager array of appliances that crash as they fall from the counters. The hot box. The toasting unit. The charger for the smartphone. And the power strip.",
            "He tries to say something, but it gets lost in the raucous clatter. With a final tug, all the life-softening devices cross the threshold, and I kick a toaster that blocks the door across the kitchen.",
            "\"I hope one day you can be stronger than the pathetic weakness that is legion in your world. Your brother would be ashamed of what you've become.\" I hurl the smartphone in his direction, but without the strength to hurt.",
            "And his words are the last I hear before the door slams shut forever.",
            "\"And, and don't come crying to me again. I won't be there. I mean it! I—\"",
            "I slam the door, scalding the new handle until it's unusable: the handle that Cody installed after the second time I crossed over. The threshold closes for a final time. No longer will that avenue of solace be open to me, because all I have left is to purge every trace of weakness from my process.",
            "For my family this time.",
            "Maybe Cody is right in his approach. Maybe he's right to extinguish his sense of spirit when nothing ever comes of it. And maybe that wrenching feeling of discomfort will become a new home for me, when I'm doing all scouting quests instead of slothing around the town of Gaffesend raking leaves and guarding potatoes.",
            "I hear a thunk on the other side: something contacts his door after he slams it. Maybe it's his head. And maybe he's sitting there too. And maybe there's a chance I have to say something.",
            "It's the new feeling he gave me that almost entirely overpowers that experience of fear in speaking up. The one I got when he stood up to Jullian, and the one I find when he flashes that stupid smug grin of his when he says something provocative. It's the same feeling I got when I received the letter from Aldrin: I panicked more at the ramification of my mother's words than the failures in my training.",
            "I open my mouth with the hopes that something will come out to rectify this, to yell across the door, but I decide to push those feelings down. They're feelings that have only gotten me into trouble, because I can't be the perfect soldier like Aryn: no wonder Jullian and all my friends are over me.",
            "Instead, I reach for the letter sitting on the low table, reading and rereading and rereading the first set of lines again and again, wondering when I'll have to meet them, and what I'll say when I pay them a visit.",
            "It was dated a month-and-a-half ago.",
            " DEAREST KATIYA,",
            "NEXT MONTH, WE WILL BE MOVING TO GAFFESEND, ENTRUSTING THE SAFETY OF OUR FAMILY TO THE STEADFAST BRAVERY OF OUR CHILDREN."

            "The six-man patrol of an Army long-range surveillance detachment flies under the cover of darkness in the predawn hours, kept awake by the thrum of the rotor — and the talk of anything that might distract them. First it was family, then to food, then it devolved to getting Keller to retell the story of his \"favorite worst pregnancy scare.\"",
            "But now the conversation is anywhere else, and instead of Helten delivering another sobering recitation of the plan, Gjersee decides to start a war.",
            "He rubs his mustache. \"You fuckers don't even know what good food is. My mom makes the best food. Her enchiladas are amazing, passed town from my abuela.\"",

And then he turns to Aberbook, sparing no-one in the free for all. \"At least it's better than this guy — he can't  taste anything his mom makes, because anything that tastes like something isn't Kroger.\"",

            "Gjersee searches for words. And Dunsmore leans in to add: \"He's calling you stupid, if you can't put that together. A GED is the piece of paper you were supposed to get at...\"",

            "\"Don't talk shit about Cody,\" Jackson says, as he unclips the latches around the top cover, revealing the smooth contours of the RQ-11B Raven drone recessed in the die-cut foam. He frowns when his fingers touch the chassis, feeling the coldness of the metal despite the seven hand warmers pinched between incisions in the foam.",
            "Aberbook squints his eyes when he looks down at the drone. \"Say, Jackie, did you plug that thing into the wall last night, or did you forget?\"",
            "\"It's not that,\" he says, taking the battery pack underneath his arm. \"She's  more of a warm-weather girl. Prefers the sandbox over the tundra.\"",

            "\"Going dark,\" Dunsmore recites, and flicks off the muzzle light he was using to inspect the position of the latches. And after the fumbles over locking the last three, he slides it beneath the seat: closing his eyes, trying to remember how this moment rhymes with the helicopter tour he took in Maui, convincing himself that the biting cold is similar to the numbness of bright sunshine flooding through the window as they descend into the valley of the landing zone.",
            "The dream ends when the door slides open. Synthetic daylight glows green in his night-vision goggles. He removes all his belongings faster than a civilian on a short layover: dismounting the rumbling steel chassis to plant his boots in the dry snow.",
            "It's after the six disembark that the blades accelerate, and moments later, the helicopter is gone, disappearing rapidly into the cover of night, leaving the six skilled foreigners with their feet planted two hundred miles inside a foreign land.",
            " \"We're Oscar Mike,\" Helten says, urging his team to motion. \"We're ten klicks out from observation point Alpha: right on the ridgeline of the suspected logistics hub. And we've got about an hour of dark to get there and set up.\"",
            "But they're well-conditioned despite the burly camouflaged coats and protective gear: each hauling a load of equipment. In Desert Storm, it was hours spent suffocating in gas-resistant NBC suits under the punishing sun, but even with the alpine cold and constant snowfall, the ache of muscles and thinness of the mountain air makes it feel just as exhausting.",
            "Helten tells his team to \"stay frosty\" when they break the summit of the first ridge, and Gjersee reminds him that they already are. They walk in a single-file line, compressed by heel and toe so that the snow fills in faster. The others seem alright, but Dunsmore feels his panic rise over the contents of the case.",
            "\"How much further, Helten?\" Dunsmore mutters.",
            "\"About three klicks out. Why, you got somewhere to be?\"",
            "\"No. I'm not asking for me.\" Dunsmore gestures to the case. \"Some of us can't stand the cold like humans do.\"",
            "\"Then we'll launch shortly after establishing our position,\" Helten says.",
            "Dunsmore tensions his grasp against the handle, as if he could transfer the rest of his meager surplus of heat. He requisitioned an extra battery, trying to warm it inside his coat as his other hand carries the case, trudging between the sharp needles of unfamiliar trees as Helten heads their caravan."

Gjersee and Aberbook unroll the camo cover to thaw against the brush, setting a tarp down in an odd recession of the ridge that masks the mast as just another continuation of its rocky edge.",
            "Chemlights are planted in the snow with the glow facing down, and the infrared strobes are tested: only visible as a green shimmer on their night vision goggles.",
            "It's hard enough to set up camp when Jackson dedicates so much of his focus to warming the heart of the drone, reminding him of the battery on his GameBoy Advance back in middle school, when his family took ski trips to the mountains and his brother Cody hoarded the console for too long.",
            "He finds the courage to peek at the power level indicator: two lights out of four, and it hits him with a panic. It's been nearly five minutes since setup and the camo tarp already bows under the weight of the fat flakes, and though it blends them further into the landscape, Gjersee works to gently shake off the residual clumps of sticky snow.",
            "Jackson's hands feel so slow when he withdraws the Raven's controller, cracking open the pelican case for one last time as he steadies the small machine in his hands. He snaps the battery into its slot as Aberbook watches — steadying the drone in one hand like his father Alan once did with the model plane at the park.",
            "And in one smooth throw from behind cover, tangent to the perimeter of the logistics hub, the engine whirs to life, climbing as the small, matte, metal bird struggles to settle in the slipstream of the valley's wind lane, scanning with its watchful eye.",
            "Helten records this stage in his logbook: 0428 / INFIL COMPLETE / OP ALPHA ESTABLISHED. Above their heads, the silent drone slices the precipitous air with its long, curved wings, and even higher, Overwatch listens for every word of their transmissions, transcribing their reports to the last surviving record of OPERATION BLUEWINGS.",
            "The team settles in absolute silence against sleepless shadow. Jackson flies the grid as the rest of the team stakes the sectors and posts observers.",
            "The heavy gusts knock the Raven sideways as it tries to stabilize. Without the feedback of the whir overhead — or a haptic sense of the drone's disturbances — Jackson Dunsmore feels deprived of critical senses that might allow him to steady the small machine that's bullied and buffeted about the sky. ",
            "He holds a breath until the thin air burns his lungs. The console's power indicator flicks down to the second bar, and the wind is getting stronger, covering the display with flakes of snow that are too cold to condense.  And as the Raven approaches for its first pass over the logistics hub, the first signatures of enemy life illuminate the screen: far more dots of white-hot heat than they anticipated.",
            "\"I'm counting at least twenty tangos on the ground,\" Jackson mutters. It was supposed to be just several men that were sustaining the supply line, and he doesn't have to infer what that means to the other four of them. There were rumors of his presence in the area, and whether this was an act of God or unfortunate coincidence, the discovery overwrites the assumptions of their plan, and how well-defended this compound might be.",
            "Helten transcribes the discovery that sends an even colder chill through all of them. \"Overwatch, confimation of HVT present in facility.\"",
            "But there's no reply. Dunsmore eyes the rubber antenna pointing like a tiny flag into the darkness.",
            "\"Overwatch, do you copy?\"",
            "And as the wind accelerates, casting an array of blinding flakes that vanish their operating point into a room of white, Dunsmore struggles to distinguish anything through the drone's camera. The battery level flickers between one and empty, and only halfway over the logistics hub, his controls transfer over in slower and slower responses, like remotely driving a rover on the moon.",
            "He wants to curse, but the fear of violent crosswinds carrying his foreign words halt the words in his throat as his freezing hands tension further around the control sticks. It's then that the feed disconnects entirely, plunging the bright-green rectangle of the screen into darkness.",
            "LIVE FEED DISCONNECTED, it reads, though the vitals of the machine still come through. He drives blind by the accelerometer's roll, pitch, and yaw, panic-stricken by the precipitous pitch that tells it's pointed forty-five degrees down, like a surface-to-air missile without a payload.",
            "Aberbook mutters something to him, but he's too lost in panic: far from staying frosty when his mind is ablaze, struck with the decision whether to level the drone above the enemy's heads in audible detection range, or plunge it straight into the ground to stop the sound.",
            "Then the feed flicks back: only for moments, flashing with the white-hot ruminations of a gathering of tangos, so close that he can distinguish the heat from each of their fingers. ",
            "Fate makes the decision for him when the power cuts out. The drone accelerometer coughs one last string of readings: so steep the absolute position is lost in gimbal lock.",
            "And over the console:",
            "Jackson's throat goes dry as the tablet flashes red. \"Viper Six to Overwatch — Viper Six to Overwatch, come in. Raven is down . . .\" his mind fumbles for the recited coordinates \" . . . Raven is down, grid 13T VH 679 334. TIC. Request QRF/CASEVAC. Over.\"",
            "Static eats the end of his sentence: white and granular like the snow, and moments later, the base's alarm blares loud enough to fight the headwind, radiating the air with flashes of red.",
            "Now thirty sets of enemy eyes scan the ridge, expecting them, with far better equipment than their team could carry on foot. Tracer rounds radiate the snow in streaks of red, punching the crust of the ridge as the team coalesces behind the barrier, their only line to Overwatch severed by the brutal storm."

            "\"This is all my fault,\" Dunsmore mutters. His voice trembles: their LRF detachment wasn't intended for combat, and six M4 rifles against the concentrated might of the enemy feels like lobbing stones at an M1 Abrams tank.",
            "\"You can't control the weather,\" Gjersee mutters, just as the shrill sound of snowmobile engines undercuts the whine of the alarm. But Dunsmore eyes the antenna, allowing shame to stir his emotions towards an act of courage. ",
            "Helten urges them to move. Keller keeps trying the comms, but to no avail, and as they stumble up the wooded hills with aimless bullets whizzing overhead, they struggle to crest the summit.",
            "The belligerent snowstorm conceals their forms, directed now only by the sense of \"toward\" and \"away\". Somewhere below, the snowmobile engines cut off as the enemy follows their footprints, firing volleys uphill as Aberbook takes over trying the radio.",
            "\"Viper Six to Overwatch, Viper Six to Overwatch,\" he says, breathlessly, as rounds eviscerate the bark of trees on their uphill climb. \"Request QRF/CASEVAC.\"",
            "And then static crackles over the radio, interspersed with the words of Overwatch. \"Repeat, Viper ... exfil ... activity ...\"",
            "Gjersee turns to Dunsmore. \"The signal is getting better: once we get up there, we just need a wi—\"",
            "The first round finds flesh instead of bark, stealing the words from Gjersee's throat. The punctuation is in the awful gasping sound as Gjersee chokes on blood, unable to breathe enough to continue his climb. Aberbook rushes over to grab him by the vest, dragging him up the hill as his other hand holds his medical provisions. They're so close to the crest of the hill, and as Dunsmore offers his other hand to help Gjersee as the life loosens from his limbs, the first coherent string of words rattles over the comms.",
            "\"Viper Six, provide SITREP. Viper Six ...\" and then the words retreat to static when the weather accelerates.",
            "Dunsmore is kept viscerally awake by awful sound of Gjersee next to him, as their medic Aberbook tries to tend him on the run. Helten and Keller stay several steps ahead and to the left, firing in bursts back downhill as covering fire.",
            "Dunsmore feels the sting of something hot in his left shoulder, so flooded with adrenaline that he barely registers it, still holding tightly to the antenna as a plan forms in his mind. In the frozen fog of war, the summit is only several steps away. But it's when they cross the threshold that their feet fail to find flat ground.",
            "They haven't the time to warn each other. Aberbook falls with his hand tensioned around Gjersee's collar. Dunsmore holds strong to the antenna as he cascades down a chute of stark land, feeling the texture of every rock and branch that isn't covered with powder, rolling as the strapped rifle flails violently, reaching with his arms for anything to stop him. He stops uphill of the others after several rolls, slamming his back against the bark of a tree, knocking the wind from his lungs in a cloud of exhale.",
            "He hears his comrades falling further as he inspects the antenna and the communications equipment: the last link his team has to Overwatch.",
            "\"Regroup,\" Helten manages over the comms. \"Regroup at the bottom for exfil.\"",
            "\"Negative,\" Jackson says, able to distinguish patches of land from his high point on the eastern slope. \"I'm getting us a direct line to Overwatch with coordinates.\"",
            "\"They're right behind us,\" Keller says. \"That's suicide!\"",
            "\"We each have a job here,\" Dunsmore says. \"Mine is this. Now get the fuck away from here.\"",
            "He has just enough energy to get high enough on the summit. He parrots, over and over, until his elevation is just enough, as the enemy combatants come closer and closer, able to distinguish every syllable of their language through heaving breaths in the climb. The rifle is too defective to fire, but his handgun is still strapped across his chest, and he withdraws it after he makes it to the top.",
            "The adversary expects them to still be far. It was a couple snowmobiles that raced over here: maybe two tangos per machine, so maybe they're just a small detachment that took a stab in the dark.",
            "Jackson Dunsmore peeks over the edge as the sun barely peeks through the storm, just enough to distinguish their forms. The six climb the hill in a line, and Jackson's pistol is still topped off with fifteen rounds.",
            "He doesn't hesitate to pull the trigger: stabilized with his arms against the hard shell of his equipment. The first two rounds punch through the furthest targets: two headshots, painting the trees with red gray matter stickier than the sap, and when their panic makes them harder to target, Jackson turns the gun to the two closest, delivering two rounds to each of them: enough to cast them to the ground, rolling back downhill as they disappear from sight.",
            "He ducks back behind the ridge as several rounds whiz overhead from automatic weapons. He abandons the equipment for a brief moment as he slides along the edge towards the first two victims: hearing one voice become quiet and another become louder, surely commanding each other to \"split up.\"",
            "Jackson waits as he hears volleys of rounds from the eastern slope, and looking down, he finds the team far down and right, providing covering fire as a distraction, to edge them away from Jackson's position.",
            "Surely enough, the closest combatant turns to approach the other. Jackson hears his voice though he still hides behind the ridge, and when he stands up to fire his rifle, he doesn't expect a seventh.",
            "The trigger pull sounds off a blast in stereo: two simultaneous pulls at two different targets. And though the enemy in front of him collapses, Jackson feels a stinging pain in his chest as he falls to the ground, holding weakly to the summit's edge.",
            "He tastes and smells the iron in the air. It's too dark to distinguish the color fo what flows out in front of him, but the directive changes when he eyes the antenna sitting roughly twenty yards away. ",
            "Rounds from his friendlies blow eviscerate the seventh crouched behind him, and he hears a shrill scream as rifle rounds tear through the flesh of his attacker.  Past the antenna, the last survivor crouches behind the other edge, and as Dunsmore wills his fading body to approach, he reloads the M9 with a magazine: reaching for the first one to find the bullet blasted through his chest and out the center — then for the second one, removing the empty clip and trading it for another.",
            "The last enemy is injured, in a state of incontroverible panic — maybe just some low-ranked, dutiful base-dweller servicing snowmobiles and taking stock, and it shows in the spread of bullets. ",
            "He pulls the trigger in Jackson's direction until the mag runs out, pulling three, then four, then five times past the hollow click, reaching into his pockets for more. ",
            "But Jackson is faster. And when he raises the handgun, it takes just one pull for deliverance.",
            "The adversary collapses against the eastern face with part of his jaw missing, twitching before gravity reclaims him, casting him downhill like the rest of Jackson's team. And when he hears the second wave of reinforcements surely responding to the exchange, he rushes faster than his wounds will let him, steadying the antenna as he takes enough wind into his lungs to speak.",

            "Three young boys stare up at the dense canopy of trees, squinting their eyes to watch as the girl makes her way across the branch, approaching the point where two trees are ten seasons from shaking hands. ",
            "\"How did you even get up there?\" A boy asks, watching from the ground as she dangles above the village's ancient stone wall.",
            "\"The bark of these trees thicken with age,\" the girl says, swaying with the long branch as her feet swing freely. \"Widen your arms and pull together hard when you climb!\"",
            "\"You don't even have to be that high, Katiya. What if the village elder sees? What about this branch right here?\" Bertram asks. \"You don't have to go that high to get over.\"",
            "\"Because I wanna,\" she says, gathering momentum that bends the high branches as she swings her feet. \"And you're the boy, so you get to carry the tools to add to our fort.\" ",
            "The whole tree shakes. And when she knows the two younger twins are watching — Raph and Raven, who were brought along for their first adventure beyond the walls — she launches her slender body skyward, floating through the air like an ascendant Auvryan before she wraps her arms around the branch on the other side.",
            "\"Gods, Katiya,\" Bertram says, emasculated enough by the short-haired tomboy to force his stocky frame up to the second branch: death-gripping the veins of bark as the pit in his stomach seems to make him lighter.",
            "\"And now you cross,\" Katiya laughs, shimmying further across the second tree's branch. \"You get to climb the wall 'cause you were too scared!\"",
            "\"Am not!\" Bertram says, his voice trembling as he hugs the narrowing branch: high enough to drop-and-roll and pray to the Gods that he doesn't sprain an ankle if he slips. \"It's only because I'm carrying all your dad's stuff you borrowed.\"",
            "She's about to open her mouth and call him something else.",
            "\"I said I'm coming,\" he grumbles.",
            "Bertram springs from the end of the branch after his feet register on the narrow edge, dragging his husky body over the top of the ancient cobblestone wall, then grasping the rope that his village crush tethered for their return.",
            "\"We shouldn't be doing this,\" Bertram says, scratching his arms where a long scrape itches. \"Katiya's Dad said we could do another wood making thing.\"",
            "\"My dad is boring,\" Katiya says. \"He only wants us to stay close where he can watch us.\" She raises a rotten stick from the ground, and levels it at Raph, as if to knight him. \"Don't you want to explore? To show Raph and Raven our treehouse, and put them to work?\"",
            "Bertram hesitates, but the other three have already disappeared into the shaded hollow to the east. Since as early as he could remember, his parents regaled him with tales they bought from the old book shop in Gaffesend across the lake: tales of adventure, of courage and glory — so how could they get mad if he was living the same spirit of the dungeon-crawling adventurers a hundred years ago?",
            "Katiya drags the stick against the ground, tapping every tree with a whip of the wrist. \"My Dad says he'll make all of us swords when we're double-digits,\" she says. \"A year is so far away!\"",
            "\"And we're only seven,\" the twins say.",
            "\"It's okay. I'll let you play with it,\" she says. \"Bertram and me will get one, and then we can have duels!\"",
            "The ground begins to slope downwards, and Bertram thinks he can hear the distant sounds of war getting louder. They left this part of the world off the village map for a reason, and all he has are the instructions he committed to memory. ",
            "Due east to the clearing. Turn North to the treehouse. ",
            "They arrive at the clearing on the other side of a hill, where glistening fronds of cereal grasses reflect the sunlight: a circular clearing nearly a hundred yards in size. It's familiar to Katiya and Bertram, but a sight in the distance surprises them. ",
            "Far on the eastern side of the clearing, beneath a dark canopy of trees, they find a couple older boys that take turns pushing each other into a pond.",
            "\"It must be deep if they can dive like that,\" Raven says. \"That's deeper than the shore of Lake Gaffe!\"",
            "But Bertram grabs the young boys by their collar before they can run. ",
            "\"We don't know them. We should go around, and go to the north where the fort is.\"",
            "\"But they're playing,\" Raph says. \"They don't play during war!\"",
            "Bertram turns back to Katiya, and notices a rare look of unease in her bright, amber eyes. \"We're the older kids. We promised their parents to get them back by sundown. Maybe we should turn around and head west: do the wood stuff with your dad again.\"",
            "\"You're right,\" Katiya says. She sighs. \"Maybe more wood-shop with my dad isn't so—\"",
            "But a branch cracks behind them, and they realize they never should have turned their backs on the two mischievous twins. Raven sprints east across the green space, shouting to the strangers.",
            "\"Khiras above,\" Bertram curses. \"And—\" Raph runs after Raven, assuming  permission in the absence of authority. The other strangers notice the two boys running toward them, and stop pushing their friends into the lake, quickly jogging over to meet them.",
            "They look human. Or at least they do when they're halfway across the field: as rare as it is, they were always warned that Chymaeran adults could make themselves look like kids.",
            "\"Gods damn it all,\" Bertram says. He can't consider the fate of two reckless boys when he's deciding whether to just run home. \"They're so stupid! Stupid, stupid. There's no way,\" he says to Katiya, \"we can't—\"",
            "Katiya grabs his wrist. \"We're responsible for them because we're bigger. You remember the rules of the village?\"",
            "\"Yeah, but . . .\" we're not in the village, Bertram begins to say, but Katiya's steely glare bleeds the conviction out of his words.",
            "The strangers call to them as they shake the boys' hands. Katiya drags Bertram straight toward the group as he shields himself behind her, and over her shoulder, he sees a group of older boys and girls — maybe eighteen or something — older kids that none of them recognize from  upper seminary or the neighboring villages.",
            "\"They said they want to play hide and seek with us,\" Raven says.",
            "\"Our Elder said we shouldn't talk to people that we don't know,\" Katiya says, trying to drop hints to the other twins. She struggles to make eye contact, because it's something about their glare that discomforts her: their eyes all dark brown despite their different colors of hair, and just like the trees, he can almost convince himself he sees amethyst in the brown.",
            "\"But we're not the bad guys,\" one says, laughing a little longer than usual. \"The Chymaerans are big and purpley and thin, no?\"",
            "\"But they take faces!\" Bertram protests.",
            "\"I don't see any faces laying around here,\" another laughs.",
            "\"But what if you're walking in the flesh?\"",
            "\"Fleshwalking?\" The first older boy says. \"You know that only a tiny number of Chymaerans can do that.\"",
            "\"Like the elite ones, the Death Scouts. And they're trained for years and years and years,\" one of the others says, but then a girl strikes him in the chest. ",
            "\"But we're like you, see?\" The girl says, and a few of them offer their hands. One of the boys standing aside them looks timid and nervous: trying to approach Katiya as he walks around the circle.",
            "The four Hillfar kids touch their skin: Raven and Raph the fastest, while Bertram and Katiya hesitate. The skin is cool and wet: likely from being in the pond, though their clothes aren't damp.",
            "\"Are you convinced? Can we play now?\" The older boy asks, withdrawing his hand. ",
            "\"I don't know,\" Katiya says. \"I think we're going to play alone.\"",
            "\"We should play us versus you!\"",
            "\"But you're older kids!\" Raph says.",
            "\"Then how about we give you a big advantage?\" He grins. \"Let's play hide-and-seek.\"",
            "Raph and Raven lean closer. \"That's what we were going to play!\" Raph exclaims.",
            "The older children begin to circle the Hillfar kids until they're surrounded, spaced evenly without effort. Most of them are excited. A few others look uninterested.",
            "\"So what should we play for?\" Their leader asks.",
            "\"Play for?\" Bertram asks.",
            "\"We'll play for fun,\" Raven says. \"We don't get to have fun back home.\"",
            "\"Back where?\"",
            "Raven says, \"In—\"",
            "\"Gaffesend,\" Katiya says. \"Our moms and dads said we could play here for an hour.\"",
            "\"Moms and dads? So you're trying to say they'll be looking for you,\" the leader says. \"That's wise of them. But I think we should choose what we're playing for.\"",
            "\"If we win, then you have to let us play in the pond,\" Raph says. \"Dad says I can only swim if I have an adult. You can watch us. Can you push us in, like you did to your friends?\"",
            "They laugh. ",
            "\"Sure. We can go play in the pond, all right,\" the leader says. \"But what if you lose?\"",
            "\"I dunno,\" Raven says.",
            "\"How about if you lose, we get to throw you in? You get to float either way,\" their leader offers. \"But we should get straight to the fun. So we'll be the seekers.\"",
            "Katiya feels a freezing hand on her shoulder as one of the older kids takes a knee, and she shivers before he can deliver the words. ",
            "\"You shouldn't be playing with big kids like us. I think that some of us can get the other ones to let you go home.\"",
            "\"Why?\" Katiya asks. \" Should we be scared?\"",
            "\"I just . . . think that kids like to play to have fun. But,\" and he chooses the next words slowly, \"sometimes grown-ups don't play to win. Some of them only have fun when other people lose, and lose really, really hard.\"",
            "\"What the Res are you telling them, Vylen? Are you giving them an advantage?\"",
            "\"Nothing, Nhytyx,\" he says, emphasizing the strangeness of the name. \"I was just telling Miss Katiya here that—\"",
            "\"—We need to play,\" Nhytyx says. \"Come on: we all have the same blood around here! My daddy Ullrich is human. And so is my mom, so I am too. So we're gonna seek and you're gonna hide.\"",
            "Vylen whispers to Katiya that they don't stop when they start playing, but the twins are already running towards the North: probably headed for the treehouse though they don't even know where it is yet.",
            "Katiya feels the lucid reality of their situation finally hit her, far beyond the range of her father's shrill whistle that might bring them home. But her mind hasn't yet been taught to hesitate.",
            "\"You just lost ten seconds for cheating!\" Nhytyx sings. \"Forty. Thirty-nine, thirty-seven, oops ... I mean, thirty-eight, thirty-six ...\"",
            "\"Now run!\" Vylen urges Bertram, seizing Bertram's heart with such panic that he'd freeze if Katiya didn't grab his arm again. ",
            "Katiya's voice cracks when she speaks, and it almost scares Bertram more than the uncertainty of what awaits them.",
            "\"We're all going home,\" Katiya insists."

            "At twenty-eight, Katiya and Bertram are already halfway across the field, stumbling over uneven patches of dirt as they run as fast as their bodies will let them. Raph and Raven are laughing gaily as they cross the threshold of the tree line at eighteen, followed by Katiya at fifteen, and Bertram at fourteen — choking on the rancid taste of exhaustion in his breath as he struggles to keep up.",
            "Nhytyx's voice gets louder after they break the edge of the field, and it sounds ever-present as if he whispers in their minds, accented with the faintest resonance of Chymaeran clicks, and at twelve, while their leader's voice crescendos with excitement, Katiya can barely distinguish their slender forms from the narrow shape of the trees. The distant, thin trunks of the bordering tree line sway with the wind, but a few of them seem to lean in the other direction.",
            "At ten, Katiya manages to clench her fingers around Raven's collar like a mother cat collecting wayward childen. His face drops when he sees the unfamiliar look of panic, and when Raph turns around, Bertram grabs him by the shoulders, releasing a shriek when he pins him against a tree.",
            "Bertram is inches from his face from six to four, spitting with each syllable. \"This is not a game,\" he says. \"You need to stop playing and fight for real.\"",
            "Raph pants. \"But—\"",
            "\"We're going to the treehouse,\" Katiya says, just as Nhytyx calls TWO. The unfamiliar chill assures her that they started running long before the count. She pulls Raven so hard that he's almost flagging behind her as she runs for the knotted rope ladder: it's not in sight yet, but she can feel the shape of the forest from twelve trips before.",
            "The sound of snapping twigs sounds behind her, but too far behind her, so she doesn't dare to turn around. All she can hear beyond the heartbeat in her ears are the last words she spoke to the twins' parents, saying they'd be out to play late, and not to worry, telling a bald-faced lie about some stupid game she made up on the spot, and they were stupid enough to believe her.",
            "And now they're too far to be saved by anyone. She thinks she can see obsidian shadows moving faster than her tiny legs in the corner of her eye, but her vision is too dry, and as the sweat burns and dries them even further, she can only run on the newfound feeling of panic that overwhelms her.",
            "But she made a promise, and she's going to protect them. They're going to climb up the treehouse and go from there. They're going to climb up the tree and—",
            "Where is it?",
            "She stops. Anticipation swells in every space of  her body where muscles aren't fighting to escape, and she looks up to the top of the canopy, and surely enough, the treehouse is still there — but the rope ladder is snagged in a branch from some heavy gust of wind.",
            "\"Gods damn it!\" Bertram says.",
            "Katiya catches two seconds of breath, her body urged to act before she can think, climbing the tree with all the holds she memorized before they could smuggle the rope.",
            "\"Go, Katiya, go! Or else we'll have to go to the shrine,\" Bertram says.",
            "Her arms strain, and she hasn't the time to climb carefully: scratching her body everywhere as she fights nature more than the chase. She can hear whoops of laughter. And as she fights to withdraw the line of the ladder without falling, she gives up and jumps for it: leveraging all her weight on gravity  to bring the shoddy ladder down from the branch.",
            "And it gives.",
            "Her hands tension around both strands of the long loop of rope, wrapped once around a thick branch, and when her feet try to find the thin rungs of the ladder, she feels the wood snap beneath her, helpless as she falls to the ground and the wind is knocked out of her.",
            "But the boys are already climbing the ladder before she can find another breath that will enter her lungs. Bertram grabs her as she hears an inhuman voice click in the distance, claiming that \"climbing is cheating,\" but she finds she's already on the ladder below Raven and Bertram, leaving the last boy to climb alone as he wets his pants.",
            "She can see them now. Bertram drags Raven over the edge of the platform, then pulls Katiya as she scrambles through the splintered hole in the logs, and then Katiya reaches for Raph, only to notice that he's much further down the ladder than she thought.",
            "\"Please don't leave me,\" Raph sobs, snot covering his reddened face as he struggles to lift himself up the ladder.",
            "His left foot reaches the step that Katiya broke, and he stumbles, just as something dark and obsidian slices the air where his head was like a scythe harvests grain.",
            "And Katiya feels something weak and feeble that she hates inside her bring her further over the edge to reach as the Chymaeran Death Scouts cycle through the faces of human children they stole to terrify them further, and when she slips over the edge, Katiya and Raven grab her ankles, giving het just enough distance to grab Raph by the wrist.",
            "The Chymaerans give them space at the spectacle: maybe impressed a little, and maybe that slash was just a controlled act of terror.",
            "Nhytyx changes back to the form of the older boy as fast as Katiya can blink. \"You're a lot faster than the other children. But you get up there, and where will you go from there?\"",
            "Bertram and Raven pull with all their might. Katiya winces as her waist is stabbed with a thousand tiny splinters as she comes over the edge with Raph, the smell of excrement wafting through the air as the suspended twin cries. But when they pull him to the top, they realize his cries are of pain instead of panic, and when the dark crimson begins to soak the severed halves of the treehouse's planks, they find the reason Raph was light enough to pull.",
            "He crawls with a single foot as his skin turns pale: colder than the Chymaerans, and somewhere far below, the boys play catch with the part of him they left behind.",
            "\"I guess one part of you is going to get to dip its toes in the water first,\" Nhytyx clicks. \"But the rest is soon to follow!\"",
            "Raven holds Raph as he's on the verge of passing out, clutching the stump at the base of his twin brother's leg. The treehouse trembles as the scouts shake the trunk, casting amateurly-assembled planks driven with shallow nails, and as they hold to the only parts of the fort that hold their weight, Raph slips from Raven's grasp, sprawled across the uneven surface as his blood flows like sap between the gaps.",
            "Katiya tries to reach for him as she hugs the largest branch, but something resists inside her. The dry, severed logs are cracking beneath the weight, and when she finally wills her body to grab for the dying boy, he crunches through the platform, falling headlong as Katiya follows after.",
            "She falls for seconds, and she doesn't feel the rapture of swinging between trees. Below, the boy called Vylen extends his arms and catches her, barely able to slow her fall as something else catches Raph.",
            "Katiya lands to find Raph expressionless, yet impossibly upright as Vylen reluctantly claims that he \"found her,\" failing to convince the others that their game is over. But Katiya's head rests against something else, something uneven and organic. Something that sliced the flesh from her left brow to her cheek, and something that separates her skull from Raph's.",
            "The boy chokes with a guttural cry as he reaches for his head, finding that a branch has pierced directly through his jaw and out his mouth. Ralph stands fully upright, barely able to touch his toes as he tries to speak her name, but it's just the consonants.",
            "And Katiya screams.",
            "No longer does she remember the two other boys still hiding in the tree. She flees away from the treehouse, and away from home though she doesn't even realize it, and she runs and she runs, sobbing and weeping and screaming with the rapture of a fresh new emotion she's never experienced before, running and running until she breaks the trees, running through the clearing though she's lost every sense of direction and can't hear if they're still following her.",
            "She stumbles over something soft on the far side of the clearing, but doesn't have time to look. The pond is murky, dark, and motionless, as if the waves forgot how to move, but her nose is too stuffed from the crying to tell the contents of the brine.",
            "It's when the second clothed object arrests her feet that she falls headlong into the still water — finding all the other friends that Raph said they were pushing in."

            "It's the cold snap that brings her back again, to find herself floating in a pit of flesh and brine. She must have been warmed by the panic of her rapid breathing in the last moment she remembers: feeling her meager volume of Essence sear her skin with the powers of fire she hadn't even learned yet.",
            "And in the odd moment of stillness, before she finds the space for the newfound habit of panic to arrest her again, she wonders if she's made it to the Reservoir of Souls when she looks up at the blanket of stars, like the planes of dark obsidian in the barren, dimensionless landscape where all their souls will convene to be born again.",
            "But she doesn't hear the voice of her grandfather calling her into the mist, or the voices of all the ones she's told will die long before and after her. She hears the voice of the seekers approaching as they hoist Raph's body in the air.",
            "She thinks something must have dislocated in her mind at how easily the panic arrives, but can't move when her body's so numbed by the languid brine of blood, rot, and water.",
            "Their voices click in their foreign tongue, passing through excited vibrations as their guises dissolve from the faces they stole. And as the cold brings her signature of life to a near halt, feathering the edge of death, she can only listen as they start to slide between languages.",
            "\"What happened to the two in the tree?\"",
            "\"They ran sometime after the boy and girl fell, and that bitch ran,\" another says.",
            "\"And where did she go?\"",
            "\"Probably ran home like the others, doesn't matter. Those kids and all their friends and family will all end up in holes like this one, whenever the reinforcements shoe and we get the others.\"",
            "One of them laughs, saying something in clicks. \"Speaking of, our work isn't done. And I think we have one last contribution to make here,\" they say.",
            "\"Dumb fucking kid,\" another laughs. \"Makes all this shit almost worth it. Swimming in a pond? Pushing each other in?\"",
            "\"Well, let's make his last moment count,\" Nhytyx says, and Katiya hears the rustling of fabric. They count in clicks as Raph is still too weak to make a sound — blotting out the starry sky like a small, dark comet before he slams into the solid, wet mass of bodies, shaking the entire mass as Katiya remains motionless.",
            "\"This pit is done. Let's dig half the next and save the rest for the morning,\" Nhytyx orders. \"The rest of you set up camp.\"",
            "And when their thin silhouettes no longer shadow the constellations, Katiya reaches over her head for the small boy, pulling with all her might, dragging to her chest the outcome of her cowardice.",
            "It was only last week that her father began to teach her how to heal, but she can feel the dying Essence in the spilled blood of the hapless civilians like electrons flowing freely between atoms.",
            "To pull the vital source is to feel flashes of those final moments, but it's nothing compared to the incessant sound of digging somewhere past the edge of the pit.",
            "At every slam of the shovel, she pulls Raph closer although she can barely feel him holding on: his tongue a dead instrument though she can feel the faintest rhythm of his heartbeat, his severed stump cauterized by Chymaeran frost so they could derive pleasure from delivering on the result of their game.",
            "And as she wraps her arms around Raph, tighter and tighter as she leeches every last spark of Essence from the dead that no longer use it, she feels the longing for something crystallized into an indebted purpose inside her as the slamming of shovels sounds off in an endless staccato, waiting forever, just for a chance to break for home.",
            "And the chance arrives after the shovels stop, and the distant clicks no longer echo across the landscape. Lantern light wanes, and when Katiya tries her muscles, she finds enough of the proffered dead Essence to lift herself from the mud and tar, feeling a debt to the victimized grow with every shambling step she takes across the wide, open field.",
            "She has no words for Bertram or Raven when she finds them at the rope, waiting there all night on the faintest hope of their return. Nor does she feel anything for months in the other end of the verbal lashing when they claim they fell playing heroes as they swung between the trees, hurting Raph so severely that they spent all night afraid to bring him home.",
            "She would never speak of that night again, because the only living witness without a tongue to tell would later die in the fire with his brother, when the Chymaerans chose to deliver on their promise to return.",
            "And every night since, Katiya waited at the window, feeling the chill in the air wrap around her like a wet blanket, listening to the sounds of the war front as she waited."

            "\"I want you to know that you've improved a lot since the incident last quarter,\" Nav says. He scrolls through notes on the tablet's touchscreen as he sits across from me in the dinky, makeshift break room — the break room he booked as a conference room for our weekly one-on-one.",
            "I don't say anything. I just nod until it gets him to continue, speaking further about deadlines and redlines and upcoming builds that he'll just regurgitate in our standup meeting, trying to fill every minute of the quarter-hour block so we don't get lost in small talk, at least until we get to the end.",
            "I stare at his tie as he previews the three weeks ahead, wondering if his son bought it for him: little ones-and-zeroes in colors that rhyme with Navidson-Monroe's navy blue. There isn't much left in my mind when I promised myself all those weeks ago that I wouldn't leave space for anything else. My neurons packed the boxes with every distraction, leaving only my internal clock.",
            "But it's worked.",
            "\"I've noticed your efforts,\" he says. \"You get in at seven o'clock now. Your redlines are done early. Less time 'dreaming,' so to speak, and you even come to most of the after-hours events.\"",
            "\"I am here for the team,\" I say.",
            "\"And the free donuts,\" Nav says, twisting his lips into a light smile, as if he requisitions a response. ",
            "I don't catch his attempt at a joke until the pause grows uncomfortable. ",
            "\"Huh?\" I ask.",
            "\"Like you've said the day before all the morning meetings?\"",
            "\"Oh,\" I say, losing my grasp on the numbers I was pulled from for all this idle chatter. \"Yeah. Free donuts.\"",
            "\"Well, at least today's better than donuts. Don't forget we have the company luncheon today, around noon.\"",
            "\"I'll stay hungry, then,\" I say, though most days I'm not hungry enough to eat anyways. The numbers on the scale have been going down: going to the gym with Miguel is about the only social thing I do every week. Most weekdays I sleep for five hours. Most weekends, I sleep for twelve.",
            "\"And there's some announcement or something,\" I say. \"What was the cryptic email about?\"",
            "\"I'm not allowed to say,\" Nav says.",
            "\"I thought we were headed for layoffs, and there's a promotion?\" It's probably one of the buyers after the initial layoff: one that makes the lower office even more of a ghost town. People pinch monitors, gold-tipped HDMI cables, standing desks, and black-mesh paper trays from late peers like how buzzards peck at fresh kill in the desert, leaving only the bones of thumbtacks and used paper clips.",
            "\"Maybe, maybe not,\" Nav says. \"I'd suggest you just enjoy the free food and not think too much about it.\"",
            "He opens the door, unplugging his computer as fluorescent light exchanges for the blinding blue screen that now reads HDMI_1. I pass the chatty row without a glance, retreating to my desk to realize for the first time in three hours that I left my phone in the car.",
            "But I don't touch grass to go and get it. I complete two tasks. I check in the changes. I fill out the paperwork, and when the calendar reads 12:00 COMPANY LUNCHEON (MANDATORY), I head down alone before Kei and Reed can catch me.",
            "The food is good: they always spend well on these things, and it tracks my father's words. One lunch, he told me that \"office pukes\" will \"always work under the worst conditions, if management buys a box of shitty donuts for them once or twice a month.\"",
            "But I can't complain. It's not that bad here. Even though they still separate lunches for the elevated Aerospace team — then for the technicians and the rest of us — barbecued brisket served by managers takes my mind off the mortgage. And when I sit with my father, avoiding the ire of upper managers I lit up with those irrevocable words, he's always got some gearhead vet reminiscing about brothels in Okinawa, or using fruits to describe the new girls working at a strip club in downtown Denver.",
            "The laughter abates the anger and ennui for a while, and when my father claps me on the back as he laughs at every joke, I realize it's the first time I've been touched intentionally in months. ",
            "I try not to think of the premonition I've had of the meaning behind that cryptic email. The announcement comes after the raffle, and it's easier to depress that feeling of rapturous static when I've confirmed that I'm always rolling loaded dice. ",
            "The husky technician across from me opened his raffle prize to find an extra-small women's golf polo, and put it on to give us all a laugh. We all  got USB keychains, at least: labeled MONROECAREERS.COM, probably leftovers from last month's college job fair that'd fill too much space in the supply room.",
            "And then, finally, one of the executives clears his throat when we're all halfway deep into a slice of red velvet Bundt cake.",
            "\"We want to thank you all for your hard effort,\" he says, then talks about moral values, then immediately boasts about financial values. \"And I have a special announcement here for one of the Miscellaneous Equipment Group teams, to celebrate the work of a possibly overlooked young man in our company. And, more specifically, one of the young men in the battery division.\"",
            "My flesh crawls more at the sensation of my father putting his meaty paw on my shoulder. He gestures to his friends with a smile, and I can't even bring myself to meet his eyes and glance at his expression.",
            "\"He's been with us for a while,\" he says. \"He's put in long hours and developed an exceptional prototype for an assembly we'll be using in our new power controls.\"",
            "\"Sounds like I know the guy,\" my dad jokes, joshing me by the shoulder.",
            "\"And he was on the wall of engineering talent, where he belongs.\" ",
            "I look across three tables to find him sitting next to Kei, who rests her hand on his shoulder just like my father does to me. ",
            "\"Reed Broderick, stand and be recognized!\"",
            "And I feel my father withdraw his hand from me slowly. He reluctantly puts his hands together before muttering something he might tell me after a bad little league game, and when I look to the stage, I try to avoid Kei's eye contact when she glances back at me.",
            "\"This young man has only been here for a little under a year, but he gives us all something to aspire to.\" ",
            "I can feel the rage I thought I buried all those months ago leech through the surface like coffins in a flood. But I don't have the currency for another outburst, or even to leave, so I put my hands together just like my father who tries to hide his true feelings, clapping tensely without spring in either of my wrists.",
            "But remembering the fear of layoffs and the mortgage is the only thing that can humble me: the feeling of the long, looming shadow since that first meeting I almost overslept in spring — when they said they were coming, and to prepare ourselves.",
            "\"You are,\" my dad starts as he whispers, \"you are still my son, and I'm proud of you.\"",
            "Reed returns to his seat next to Kei as I bury my head in my hands. \"Thanks, Dad.\"",
            "\"And you're doing just fine,\" he tells me. \"I guess ... you know, I'm just not important enough to give you a fair shot.\"",
            "\"It's not your fault,\" I say. And I smile. \"I should have watched my temper. They hate me now.\"",
            "\"Just don't forget what you'll always have,\" he says. \"You have the essence that you need.\"",
            "And when I mishear his words in self-immolation, an idea begins to form in my mind."

            "I thought approaching the table to congratulate my rival would be the last I'd have to see him today. I left before he got the new insignia for his cubicle's nametag, before all the other strangers could approach him and offer their praise.",
            "But when I saw the large, crumpled box labeled MCMASTER-CARR on his desk, taped with a manifest from the machinists' cell with REWORK emblazoned in a large red stamp, I should have known he'd suffer quietly for another thirty minutes after he returned.",
            "Reed only shuts up for a while when he's nervous: the only other sounds in the office are the 3D printer's whine, Wilbur's wake-apnea, and Michael's drastic fit of coughs every quarter hour, and when any of them are missing, I know that something's wrong.",
            "But he's not the kind to go it alone. And when I'm sitting in my chair, watching myself do grunt work as my mind goes blank, he approaches me with the heavy box in his hands, choosing me as the elder subordinate to help him.",
            "I try to look busy, but it's hard not to notice him: holding a box between his arms in a mess of paper and packing tape, struggling to keep his grasp as I decide to wait a little longer.",
            "\"Cody. Hey, Cody,\" he finally says. as a couple bolts fall out of the bottom of the box, disappearing under my desk. He reflexively reaches for them with a burdened hand — then one of the mild-steel panels tears a hole in the side of the box, sliding out slowly until I push it back in.",
            "\"I, uh . . . could use your help,\" he says.",
            "\"No shit,\" I say, removing the other ear of my half-worn headphones. \"Why aren't you holding it by the bottom?\"",
            "\"It was a box when I started lifting it,\" he says. He shifts his weight to support the clattering mess of parts and washers and nuts and bolts inside, as Wilbur peeks his head over the partition. \"I heard you were born with a wrench in your hand,\" Reed continues, \"and I could use a second set of eyes on this prototype.\"",
            "\"Oh,\" I say. The pieces start to look familiar. \"It's the one from the presentation?\"",
            "\"Yeah, but...\" he gestures with his head to the manifest. \"There's some issues. And I think you understand this better than I do.\"",
            "The technicians slapped a barcode sticker that summarizes it better than the manifest, and beneath the pattern of lines is three words.",
            "\"Shit don't fit,\" I read.",
            "He drops the box in the empty cubicle across from me, unable to withhold the loud clatter of big metal pieces and screws, so loud that the purchasers across the room begin to laugh. \"And I'm not looking forward to the techs making fun of me over this,\" he says.",
            "And maybe they should, I think, and there's a part of me that so badly wants him to fail the way I hoped he would, the way I told him off after our walk all those months ago.",
            "But Reed is desperate, still hugging the pieces together as he begins to tremble from the weight. \"So can we grab a conference room?\"",
            "And I ask, \"is that an order?\"",
            "He looks at me with a different kind of panic, as if I poached the elephant in the room while it was weak. But I spring from my chair, finding an odd relief in the spectacle.",
            "\"Kidding,\" I say.",
            "I reach with another set of hands, unloading the uppermost pieces from the box. The parts are so smooth: it looks and feels more like an industrial art piece than my soulless origami design.",
            "\"You put so many fillets on this thing, I can't feel an edge,\" I say. \"No wonder all this slipped out.\"",
            "\"I tried to apply your critiques and all, but they already ordered it,\" Reed says. \"They said it was just a prototype. And I'd have to rework it, but I don't know anything about putting it together.\"",
            "And yet you got the damn promotion, a part of me says, but it's something about his vulnerability that keeps me quiet, even if today's the second-worst day I've had working here.",
            "We settle in the conference room after placing down rubberized mats from the machine shop, and ransacking my father's toolbox for all his lower-drawer, half-broken tools when he's having a smoke outside.",
            "He sits as I take the assembly in my hands, trying the fit — remembering the vicious wisdom of all the unsettled technicians that approached me in the two-and-a-half years before Reed got here, distilling it into something constructive although the anger is still there.",
            "They'd lambaste the poor bastard over fits. One of the holes is designed for thread, though it's supposed to let it through. The square edge jams into a round because he forgot a chamfer, and sitting in the same seat I almost lost my job in, I tell him what to fix as he takes notes on a printout.",
            "\"So we need to rework this ourselves,\" I say.",
            "\"But how?\" He asks.",
            "And so we go to the floor.",
            "I enter Dad's code for the supply box. I kit him out with gloves and sandpaper and taps and drill bits, and we head to the belt sander. And I let him work the steel surface like my father did when I first got here — humored by his panic at the silver sparks that launch from friction.",
            "And then to the mill. And then with the two-fluted end mill that we chuck in three pneumatic chirps, where I explain that this two-ton, belt-driven beast can only change gears when it's in motion, unlike the lathe that changes gears when it's halted.",
            "We set the pieces so they're square with the machine and clamp them down, and when the spindle reaches its speed of eight hundred rotations per minute, I find myself back in the zen of the machine shop all those years ago: shaving fifty thousandths at a time on pass after pass of quiet precision; casting slivers of scalding steel from the surface that dance in long, mesmerizing ribbons; hearing the coolant sizzle against the steel when I spray before Reed makes another hand-fed pass.",
            "And two hours later, the pieces fit — and Reed's printout is saturated with greasy fingerprints and red scribbles, our gloves pleasurably dirty with the grime of hands-on work, and for a second, I think I remember what I thought I was going to do here in the beginning.",
            "\"The church of iron,\" Reed continues. \"The gym. You have a membership too, right? We should go sometime.\"",
            "And on the rare feeling of energy spurred by a high of action, I oblige, before I find myself sitting back at my cubicle, reviewing my ongoing battery design that hasn't progressed a click since last week.",
            "The clock reads five-thirty, and when I look out the far window to the floor, the shop lights flick off one by one. Even Kei is no longer here — and as I try to understand how such a miserable day could end so reasonably, I feel that feeling of hope escape for just a second before I can recapture it."

            "And in the silence of the dark garage, I'm lit only by shop lights as I roll around on a scrapped shop stool I stole from the dumpster at work. As the soldering iron sizzles against the damp sponge, my mind replays the half-baked encouragement from my father, remembering how he told me that \"I have the essence\" of what I need.",

I tin the tip of the soldering iron, recirculating the sharp end with a growing bead of molten tin until it's almost too heavy to hold by surface tension.",
            "My hand slowly approaches the negative button end with a trembling bead, hoping it will work as flux to accept the molten metal, and the closer it gets,  the connection glows brighter with faint crimson light, no brighter than an LED.",
            "The sight distracts me from a healthy dose of hesitation. It was so easy to forget that there's an entire other world beyond the door with different rules, and when the glowing bead finally adheres to the powdered lead, drowning the contours of the cheap metal tab with scalding metal at liquefying heat, I'm unprepared for the realization of what comes next.",

            "The powder works as flux.",

And when my finger flicks the slide switch, I feel a massive jolt of energy kick the flashlight backwards as it slips through my hand, casting the entire garage in a bright, crimson glow.",
            "The nurled handle of the flashlight embeds itself in the pegboard, displacing all the tools in a raucous clatter as a wall-mounted bucket of tiny screws explodes like shotgun pellets, but the crash is silent compared to the otherworldly, phantasmic screech that rings in my ears.",
            "My eyes and ears need seconds to recover — my heart even longer — as my eyes fall to the triplet spread of holes in the far wall, siphoning streetlight in three beams that take shape from floating dust.",
            "But it's not in the steel of the garage door. It's in the solid wall, and when I approach it, I peek with one eye through the half-inch peephole to find two <em>MORE</em> new holes a hundred feet across the driveway, glowing with heat as a road sign now reads ST P."

            "This dinner provides the briefest respite from the last two months of agonizing intensity, but I remain on-guard against myself. My left fist clenches beneath the table to try to prevent me from relaxing too much, or else my head might plunge into the porridge after all the sleepless nights I stayed awake — dreading every tomorrow for the same reason every morning.",

            "\"Surprised, daughter?\" Holden asks, massaging the tender meat of my shoulders that have tensed for weeks, even in slumber. \"You look like you're going to pass out.\"",
            "\"No. This is great news,\" I say. \"Just a lot to take in.\"",

            "\"She'll be on my side in no time,\" he says, placing his hand over my clutched fist to try to get me to release. \"I've been watching her personally. And she's been working as hard as she did in the Academy.\"",
            "\"That's so good to hear,\" Stella says. Tears crest her eyes as she rests a hand on her stomach. \"So many years we've waited, but this is a chance for us to be a family again. To take back everything.\"",

I went out there with only the emergency lights on, missing security and custodial staff that might have asked me to turn around, with the battery in one hand and the pouch of Essence in my pocket. I only used his credentials because \"open to anyone\" stops applying after hours. I've heard the techs let each other in all the time: even engineers, and the sign reads PROTOTYPE SHOP OPEN 24/7: TEST LABS RESTRICTED, leading me to ignore the intimidating packet of operating procedures pinned to the bulletin board outside the door.",

It was too dark to read in the dim light from all the other screens, and I convinced myself that it was just there to secure the wires, not that it was locked and tagged out. ",

            "The readings broke all the rules of this world, and it didn't take numbers to realize the room was getting colder. I turned up the current through the wire until I could see my breath fog the power supply's seven-segment readout. A stack light flashed red around the time I almost thought I'd need gloves to withdraw the pouch of Essence. Then the E-stop relay tripped. The cell status flipped to HOLD, and the HVAC system sputtered to life after it logged an anomalous temperature, recirculating heat into the cold air.",

And if any scientist witnessed the sheer impossibility of a battery discharging power while charging — like a candle creating wax as it burns upwards — it would efface every understanding of science. And if it leaked further, I'm certain there wouldn't be a power in the world that would hesitate to use all their strength to secure the source.",

The moment made me feel powerful, like I could accomplish something the powers above would have to accept. But I should have known why Prometheus was sentenced to rot for all eternity.",

Everything was fine when I left the office at 6:35, saying goodbye to an unfamiliar, overnight gate guard. I took for granted how we only scan IN to the office and not OUT.",

Maybe she slows the world around us because she needs more time to unscrew all the bottled thoughts she has: the gentle ones; the ones she couldn't spill to her hearty band of brothers.",
            "The dormant grasses crunch beneath our feet on a nearby trail as the morning sun filters through the falling leaves, and I wonder if she's dropped a second since we left.",
            "\"You know, I've followed you for a while,\" Aryn says, and yet my first instinct is to think of the smartphone in my pocket: the one I've been charging in my hand with Essence, still secretly siphoning that invisible \"cloud\" from Cody's place.",

It just meant more money to keep us close, so I never had a sense of adventure. Not when I was stuck with four other sisters running around all the time.\"",

It's why I didn't have many friends beyond the ones that wanted to play at my house,\" she says, \"but I'd look at you, and the physical proof of what you survived. And most of all, how even though you went through all that suffering, you still decided you wanted to serve.\"",

Then high school president. Then business clubs in college, and it just kind of happened, because I never learned to speak my mind.\"",

            "\"No, but seriously,\" Reed says, as he one-ups me with thirty-fives. \"I'm the kind of engineer that will only ever be able to manage stuff. But you're destined for so much greater, because you have it.\"",

And for a moment, I wonder what he's doing and how he's been after all these months: if his face still wears that crestfallen, hollow stare, because I see the same in Aryn's expression from how her ears droop, and how her tail sweeps slowly in strokes like the feathered bow of a violin."

            "It was a walk so it doesn't count. And it doesn't matter if I've worked a long day questing.",
            "The static returns to my hands when I sit idle on my sofa. Listening to the sounds on the electric music box named JACKSON'S IPOD only worked for so long until it ran out of power, unchargeable by Essence from my hands—and though the hear-buds' end fits into the phone Cody got me, I don't have many sounds I've saved to play.",
            "But he made me a playing list on an application for my workouts — and saved it to the box, so I could use it when the \"cloud\" couldn't give the box the music.",
            "I'm efficient enough at scrolling that he told me I was \"better than his mom,\" and when I scroll through the list, I find my favorite song from a band that must have played a lot in public if they named their group after a common space.",
            "The screen reads LINKIN PARK—BREAKING THE HABIT, as it scrolls the letters across the screen. I wonder again what Cody meant when he called it \"new metal.\" I think of the sound of my stepfather's hammer in the blacksmith shop: whether hot or cold, shouldn't it make the same sound either way?",
            "But the motifs speak to me. The speed sounds like my panic. The rhythm feels like my heartbeat. It describes my anxiety better than any combination of words, and when I let it speak for that bottomless sense of panic, it makes me feel a little lighter, maybe even understood.",
            "So I take it with me, clutching my cure with the buds in my ears. I tightly lock the door and try to lose my breath again, though my body still aches: so sore and dehydrated, but there's a resentment that's stronger than the burning in my breath. So I start running, circling the lake as night approaches, fighting the feeling of dizziness that threatens to take me over.",
            "Internal weakness is an enemy I can actually fight, so I use that churning feeling of self-hatred as something combustible. The fear for my family overrides the feeling of strain in my muscles, and though I'm short of breath, I'm perfectly distracted by the chill that signals winter, breathing across the surface of the lake in a phantasmic fog.",
            "And the words of Aryn cross my mind. I remember Jullian's look of disdain, and I think of Cody and how much I miss him, though I'd never tell him that, and by the time I'm coming back after a quarter-pass around the lake, the feeling of lightness overtakes me.",
            "I struggle to catch myself before I collapse into a planter of withering mountain flowers, crunching the dormant stems beneath my weight. The darkness is immediate when it overtakes me, and when I lose control of my muscles, time flashes past in a dreamless sleep until I wake to a vibration beneath my leg.",
            "My head aches. My tongue is parched. The two moons and Oceanus hang brightly in the sky, and though my vision blurs from overwork and dehydration, I'm close enough to the house to read a message from the other world.",
            "It's from one of the only two contacts I have, and it's not Kei: it's from Cody, and it's urgent. I'm only a block away from home, and by the time I approach to see what happened, his three texts pop onto the screen.",

            "I just want to go home, but now more than ever. I rushed through every redline I could early, just to have an excuse to be up and around, just to listen, because I've heard nothing so far from the team.",
            "I ate lunch in the empty set of cubicles that look out to the shop floor, pushing away the furloughed purchasers' junk they refused to take home. I watched my father toil away on the floor, sorting through the bins of KANBAN bolts and screws to make progress on his projects, none wiser since the technicians don't have an email.",
            "But they usually print out the announcements and tape them to the break room door, and every hour I got up to scan the floor for Human Resources, or Compliance, or a new posting on the door my father will surely bring up, I don't find anything.",
            "Maybe they expect the technicians. Maybe that's why they haven't bothered coming up here. Or, shit, maybe they're playing it \"fast and quiet,\"waiting for a response — or maybe it's like those cop shows where they give the guy eight hours to wait and stew before they interview him? If that's the case, then—",
            "\"How many coffees have you drank today?\" Wilbur asks, peering over the edge of his cube. \"Are those bathroom breaks, or did you put Red Bull in the coffee filter?\"",
            "\"I'm not seeing noises yet,\" I say, but the flatness in my voice doesn't carry the joke.",
            "\"What's wrong?\" He asks.",
            "\"Nothing,\" I say. \"Just, uh . . . a little nervous about what's coming, you know, with winter approaching.\"",
            "He leans further, speaking in a hushed tone. \"The layoffs, you mean. The ones they told us about at the start of the year?\"",
            "\"Yeah,\" I say, fidgeting with the thumb-around-the-pen trick I learned in middle school.",
            "\"Well, what brings it on now?\"",
            "\"I dunno. I just looked at the calendar the other day, and it all came back to me.\"",
            "\"Listen, Cody. You're a good engineer. You're doing just fine, okay? I guess you youngsters need to hear that more often. Ever since my generation realized participation trophies weren't replacements for an 'attaboy,' you fellas haven't gotten anything.\"He leans closer, and I can see a sincerity in his eyes that only makes me feel worse. \"I mean, you haven't done anything wrong, right? You work hard. And that origami design you came up with proves—\"",
            "Maybe it would help if I could listen. Every time his eyes return to the screen, I glance up at the clock, wondering how long before I'm in the clear and I can go home and breathe.",
            "\"It means a lot,\" I say. And it does. Wilbur Sameshima has been an engineering dad to me, but he has no idea what I'm capable of.",
            "\"Hey, Cody,\" Nav says while I'm distracted. \"Did you get the email?\"",
            "My heat sinks as I turn around. My hand fidgets the pen further. \"Yeah, the compliance thing.\"",
            "\"No, not that: just some techs doing what they shouldn't. I'm talking about the one I just sent you, about the battery project—\" He glances down at the redlines I've blasted through. \"Hai ram, am I not keeping you busy enough?\"",
            "\"Had a pre-workout drink before I went to the gym with Reed this morning, and my face still itches,\" I say. \"Big mistake.\"",
            "\"Well, at least my team is getting along,\" Nav says. \"Good work. Tell you what: how about I let you head out thirty minutes early?\"",
            "\"Really?\" I ask.",
            "\"Sure,\" Nav says, clapping me on the shoulder. \"And you did the paperwork for these changes too, right?\"",
            "\"In the system,\" I say, collecting my things as I toss my bag over my shoulder. I hear a door open on the far end of the office from the floor, and as I grab my mouse and lunchbox, I notice it hangs open to let several people through.",
            "I turn the corner of the cubes after thanking Nav. Several suits are walking towards me, but I walk in the opposite direction, banking on the knowledge that they've never seen my face before, refusing to turn around as I wave to Reed and Kei and Michael, and I proceed out to the concrete steps where I take my first real breath of the day.",
            "I rush down to my car and turn the key as soon as my leg hits the brake. And I laugh: not because I've won, but because I realize I'm feeling something other than depressed for the first time in ages, and the capacity to feel almost scares me.",
            "But there's only so long before the spike of adrenaline retreats into the same sea of apathy as I drive home. Ever since the layoff warning at the start of the year, I've constantly wondered how many more times I'd be driving the switchbacks along the hillside, and for the first time, I wonder if I can count them on my hands.",
            "I get home around the time I'd typically leave work, and by the time I pull into the garage, I realize the fear has completely left me. When I spend so long looking up from the bottom of the darkest pit, I don't think fear ever really stays: in the end, I guess I just figure it works out somehow — or if it doesn't — I just don't think I really care.",
            "The last time I felt that continuity was when Katiya was always over, like shoveling coal into the cold engine of my soul, and before that it was just the busyness of school and the incessant badgering to go out my my business major roommates.",
            "Whatever I have isn't renewable like everyone else. Just like Kei: the reason why we can't fit, if neither one of us can make the energy.",
            "I sit on the couch in the dark, and I try to cry, just to see if I can do it, because I think it's what anyone else would do, and my mom says it's healthy, but I can only muster a tear before it ends in a yawn, and my body thinks I'm just trying to wet my eyes for my contacts.",
            "And so I just sit there without turning the TV on, back to the same habit of just doing nothing until I get too bored and go to sleep.",
            "That is, until I hear the crash next door, and the desperate crash of footfalls as someone or something proceeds to tear through every room of the house next door.",
            "I open my phone and scroll through Messages to select her name. The send button is blur, meaning she has it on, and it bewilders me. ",
            "Hasn't it been months?",
            "Cody Dunsmore // 08:18How do you have blue messages? ",
            "I hear further crashes in the unit next door. Then someone fumbles at the knob between our units, and in fear, I grab my lacrosse stick: still battered to hell from Katiya's greatsword.",
            "Cody Dunsmore // 08:21Also heard something loud next door u alright?",
            "I slowly open the door between our units, reaching for Katiya's mangled knob as I notice it begins to glow.",
            "I withdraw my hand, hearing the exasperated groan on the other side, as if someone's in a rush.",
            "\"Katiya?\" I try. And then the door flings open, and I'm greeted by someone else: someone who's trying to get through to my side.",
            "But I block her. ",
            "It's a human girl with cat ears, and they're real, but before I can settle the debate over whether she has human ears, too, she pleads for me to hide her.",
            "\"Please,\" she begs, \"they're coming!\"",
            "\"Well, we can't hide in there,\" I say, closing the door behind me as the metal cools enough to stick. \"What's going on?\"",
            "\"I made my break. I used to live here: it's the only place I could think of, but they know where I am and they're after me because I can't ever leave and I—\"",
            "\"Calm down,\" I say. I find myself patting her head reflexively before I rip my hand away, rushing to Katiya's front door as I hold the lacrosse stick end-up. She must be close enough to get my WiFi after I installed the extender right outside my door, because her messages are still blue.",
            "The front door buffets open, and at first I think it's Katiya about to close the loop on our relationship. But it's someone else: two strangers with the bodies of cats, and they're holding daggers as the catgirl shrinks behind me.",
            "I have only time to send one last text, knowing I don't have the strength to repel otherworldly assailants from another world.",

            "A different feeling hits this time, and it's so much stronger than any other. I rush down the line of row houses on a street lit by lamplight, filled with the anticipation of catching a first glance at the damage to my home. But there isn't enough of a spectacle to draw neighbors.",
            "With the element of surprise on my side, I turn into my next-door neighbor's front terrace and jump the short wrought-iron fence so I'm out of sight of my open door. There's no shattered glass, and there isn't any damage to the door frame from kicking in the entry door. Something dark and metallic protrudes from the lock, and I realize it's a key: not my key, because when I check my pockets, it's still there, and as I approach closer, I hear two panicked voices pleading with the intruders.",
            "They're both familiar. The panic in one of them stirs my feelings, but the sound of the other is difficult to remember.",
            "\"Please don't involve him, he's just a neighbor! He thought I was the girl who lives here.\"",

            "\"I have no debts to you,\" Rayna insists.",
            "\"You indebted your life when we took you in. You were a coward, a deserter, and now you're those same two things all over again. What do you think could ever be left for you here?\"",
            "\"Enough of this,\" another Ahkvasan says. \"We'll kill you and the stupid fool that tried to defend you. You thought we beat him up bad? Your bodies will be floating in the lake by midnight!\"",
            "And I feel a certain something spark in me that I thought I forgot, when I launch myself through the door: finding Cody tethered to a chair and Rayna begging on her knees. ",
            "And yet, even the power of time can't speed their reactions fast enough.",
            "I let all the fury the run failed to quell rush my circuits with Essence, and by the time my fist reaches the first Ahkvasan's face, an eruption of fire blasts them against the back window, shattering the glass as their body crunches into the frame of the lower window. As I watch Cody look on through swollen eyes, my rage builds so fast that I feel the heat coalesce around my entire body, and when the second one slows me down enough to slash my arm with the dagger, I feel nothing, as my body's already committed to driving my other fist square in the assailant's chest.",
            "It smells like burning fur, and maybe that ignites something forgotten in Aryn's forsaken sister. As the other tries to wedge their body out of the shattered glass frame, embedded with shards that redden their coat, Rayna blasts a fireball that knocks them out the window, protecting the space behind Cody as I step in front of him.",
            "\"You're not taking Rayna,\" I say. \"And you're not hurting my friend. I think you better get out of here before you wake the whole district.\"",
            "The Ahkvasan growls with defeat, clutching his chest where a scalding hole penetrates his light leather armor. I feel time dilate as his eyes flash green, trying to milk every second to choose his next move — but before I can motivate him further, he jumps out the same hole that Rayna blasted with a pounce.",
            "\"Go upstairs,\" I order Rayna, before the small crowd of disturbed neighbors begins to gather outside my door: most in jackets, and even Bertram — wearing the clothes he got from the hospital as a thin night gown.",
            "\"What happened?\" Bertram calls, as he approaches to lean in the doorway.",
            "\"Intrusion from the Den of Thieves, some local cellar gang,\" I say.",
            "\"Seriously? Are you alright?\"",
            "\"Yeah,\" I say. And I wait for a moment, and then a little longer, just to confirm, finding with surprise that the tremor isn't there. \"I'm perfectly fine.\"",
            "\"But what about the window?\" He says. Then he sees the battered man behind me. \"And your other friend, the inventor, dear Gods! You have enough Essence left to heal him?\"",
            "\"We'll be fine. But would you mind a Gaffe-9 incident report? I can't leave here,\" I say.",
            "\"Of course,\" he says. \"I'm just glad you're alright.\"",
            "And I'm surprised, I think, as he closes my entry door behind him, shooing the onlookers away.",
            "I turn to my estranged friend in the chair, looking far worse for wear, and he looks at me with an expression I've only seen on a man once before in my life.",
            "My fingers singe the tethers that strap him to the chair, and I notice his shirt is open and his sleeves are rolled up, as if he was just relaxing on the couch after getting home from work.",
            "It's just the two of us now. And inside my heart, after all the anguish and heartbreak of the last couple days, I feel the longing for catharsis draw me closer to him as I cup his face between my hands, feeling his tremor as his injuries slowly fade away.",
            "I struggle to shake the thought of all my friends in the capital that became housewives. \"I'm sorry my hands are so calloused,\" I tell him. \"I grew up swinging from trees and chopping wood. I don't think there's a soft part of me left.\"",
            "\"I seriously doubt that,\" Cody mutters, and I hear him sniffle. \"Touch isn't the only way you've brought me back to life.\"",
            "I realize I'm straddling him: sitting on his lap as his hands extend behind his chair in the darkness, and I notice he's crying softly as he sobs into my chest.",
            "I lift his chin. My thumbs trace the smooth skin above his cheeks, singing the tears from his face before I reach to hug him tighter, letting this man try to fall apart entirely right in front of me, and as the guard I am, all I want to do is to protect him.",
            "He mutters something, but I can't hear it: I can feel the vibrations of his vocal cords in my core muscles.",
            "\"Come again?\"",
            "\"I said I'm sorry for how things broke off between us,\" he says. \"I should have said something sooner.\"",

            "\"All those nights alone. I'd just sleep. I missed you, and your energy, you know, the way you seem to make everything glow.\"",
            "\"And I missed the way you calm me down,\" I say. \"It's been so stressful, all of it—\"",
            "\"And I'm almost fired,\" we both say at the same time.",
            "I come off him. \"What did you do?\"",
            "\"Brought something to work I shouldn't have,\" he says.",
            "I grimace. \"What is it? The evil lettuce?\"",
            "He thinks for a second, then laughs. \"Oh, the Devil's Lettuce? No, never,\" he says. \"I brought that bag of powder to test the energy properties.\"",
            "My face falls. \"You're kidding. You can't—\"",
            "\"—And what did you do?\" He cuts me off, standing to a head taller than me with his shirt still hanging open, his chest glistening with beads of sweat.",
            "\"Oh, uh . . . I failed a test,\" I say, looking up at his lips.",
            "\"A test?\" He says.",
            "\"I was too much of a coward. Now I'm below the line.\"",
            "\"So it sounds like you were tested, failed, and ran. But I ran a test and failed,\" Cody says, with that mischievous smirk on his face.",
            "\"This isn't funny,\" I say. \"I'm going to die if I don't pick things up.\"",
            "\"I should have been around to be there for you,\" Cody says. \"With that lousy boyfriend of yours.\"",
            "\"We split,\" I say.",
            "\"Oh. You did?\" I find a hint of masked elation on his face. \"Fuck that guy.\"",
            "\"Yeah,\" I say. \"But there are better men out there.\"",
            "\"Of course,\" he says, glancing at our list of rules I still have taped to the wall, sitting back in the chair. \"I know we have our rules.\"",
            "\"We do,\" I say. \"But what?\"",
            "He leans closer to me, looking at the tight-fitting clothes I wore to go on my run. His hand grabs me by the waist, tracing the definition in my abs with his thumb as I think he works up the courage to bend our rules a little further.",
            "But his head cocks to the side when he hears a sound at the foot of my stairs.",
            "Rayna clears her throat. \"Hello there . . . is noe a bad time?\"",

            "\"I don't know,\" I say.",
            "\"Handle what?\" Rayna asks.",

            "Even in another world, I can't escape the same dream. The only difference is that sleep comes faster on a bed that's made of clouds, instead of one made from horsehair and feathers.",
            "I'm not sure how we got here, but it was something about the way he still trembled although he insisted he was alright — still looking like he was on the verge of tears from the fear of what transpired. Maybe it's my empathy for that paralyzing, sticky feeling of fear that I know better than anyone. Or maybe it was in the feelings we both had of abandonment, as we continue to sully everything in our lives with only the best intentions.",
            "Or maybe it was the excuse to let Rayna sleep in my bed in Gaffesend that allowed us to bend the rule.",
            "Either way, fate finds me in Cody's world, upstairs for the first time. I'm on the side of the bed that faces the door, separated by two thin sheets, resting on top of the covers since I run dangerously hot. I watch Cody curled up with his head buried in a pillow: he doesn't twitch in his sleep like so many of us, but with me sleeping next to him, he breathes so easily, knowing nothing of the violence of war or its outcomes.",
            "And sleep comes easily when I listen to the pattern of his breath: his exhale warm on my bare skin as an unfamiliar breeze flows through the window, and by the time I notice how stale the air is, I've already retreated within my mind to a place I can never leave.",
            "Sometimes it's the scalding log that presses on my chest: other times, it's the body of Raph, and I'm trapped inside that pit again, struggling to survive as I wait for lifetimes in absolute silence. In one dream I'm on the verge of freezing as my body tries to heat itself with every scrap of dead Essence I can pilfer from the bodies, and in the other, I feel the heat rise until I think the flesh will melt from my bones.",
            "But after so many nights alone, even my subconscious mind has stopped providing me with a savior, knowing the bed is always empty when I wake.",
            "So the pit grows deeper, stretching downward until I can no longer see the stars, and even more victims flood the pit as the Chymaerans toss them in. Or the wooden cabin walls grow in seconds, as if grown through Verdalan magic, lifting the doors and window frames higher and higher until they're unreachable, leaving me inside the smoke-filled windowless chamber next to the charred body of my father.",
            "It's both dreams at the same time now, but there's always something pinning me to the floor as the heat rises. I look to the left as my father takes his last, scalding breaths before he turns to ash, and my lungs are burning, thrashing beneath the beam as I find I don't have a mouth to scream, and when the roof finally csves in — or the stars fall from the sky to rebury the pit of remains, I launch awake with another scream, too unconscious to question whether Jullian will be laying there.",
            "But for the first time, my hands find something else, and instead of grasping air as the dream fades from my mind, I feel Cody's touch as he tucks my head to his chest though the sheets still separate us, telling me that everything is going to be alright.",
            "And I cry, though I'm surprised I still have access to this feeling. Even without Essence, I can feel the warmth of his body, passing strings of reassuring words through trembling syllables that I've only dreamed to hear after so many months alone.",
            "And I want so badly to tilt my head up, to meet his lips to reciprocate this blessed feeling, to provide him the comfort that he also longs for, but I hesitate on that feeling of how much pain that progress would inevitably cause us.",
            "Never before have I felt this safe.",
            "So I just rest there, recirculating the warmth of my breath in the tight space between his chest as he instructs me to slow my breathing, even though his own still carries a faint whimper. The night is still dark, and moments later, I delve back into a dream that I've never had before.",
            "I find myself outside the windowless cabin, sitting on the porch, in one of the smoothly-sanded rocking chairs my father made. My fingers feel the persistence of his handiwork against the natural grain, and beside me sit my father, and my stepfather, and my mother and my siblings, and Cody, and all my friends old and new, and even family that has yet to be born, and all we're doing is just sitting there, watching the daylight climb above the sawtooth treeline of Purgatory Mountains as another long night gives way to dawn.",
            "My father takes my hand though I can't see or remember his face, but in the moment, I feel something unspoken between us — something I never tried listening for when I was so busy watching from the window.",
            "And when I wake, I find Cody still sleeping beside me with his hand in mine, and our bodies are still separated by two sheets. Maybe the only way I can repay him is to give him something he won't remember.",
            " I gently plant a kiss on his forehead, muttering the same words my father gave to me in the dream."

            "My phone vibrates beneath the pillow and I wake around 9:30, expecting to be alone — but instead of hearing birdsong through the open window, I hear snippets of words and songs playing on the other side of the bed.",
            "\"Hey, you. You're finally awake,\" Katiya says. Her eyes don't leave the screen of the smartphone as she scrolls through memes and reels.",
            "\"And you're still here.\" I feel a wetness on my forehead that I touch with two fingers, and when she notices, she blushes. \"Did you sleep alright?\"",
            "\"Best I've slept in a while,\" she says. \"And thank you . . .  you know, for taking care of me.\"",
            "\"Of course,\" I say, still adjusting to the jarring sight of a knight binging modern technology. \"And you're still here.\"",
            "She pouts. \"What, did you want me to leave?\"",
            "\"No, of course not,\" I say. \"I'm just surprised: usually you're working or going on a run around this time.\"",
            "\"I didn't like the thought of you waking up alone,\" she says, and it stirs something warm inside of me. \"You shouldn't have to wake up alone: not when I'm here.\"",
            "I blush. \"You should be careful with words like that, or else I might get the wrong idea,\" and when I look at my phone, I find three texts that remind me why I set the alarm on a weekend in the first place.",
            "They're from three different people I've brought together for the first time, and as the organizer, I'm not even ready to greet them.",
            "Kei Sakurashima // 09:00Departing my house in thirty. Will arrive around 10:00 or so.",
            "Miguel Valdez-Ruelas // 09:35oh fuck that things today with the fantasy stuff rite? on my way be there soon dont leave yet hoss",
            "Reed Broderick // 09:40Thanks again for the invite bro! On the way there now, should get there around 10 or so.",
            "\"Shit,\" I say. And \"God damn it,\" I say, launching myself from the covers as I scramble to my feet, wondering how I could set an alarm so late.",
            "\"What is it, Cody?\" She asks, dropping her phone on the mattress.",
            "\"I got a thing today with some friends,\" I say. I'm already in the bathroom with the door cracked shut, debating whether to take a \"cowboy shower\" in the sink, or take a real shower.",
            "\"What is it?\" Katiya asks.",
            "\"Last day of the Renaissance Faire in Shaleborough, at this one spot a ways past my work.\"",
            "\"Renaissance faire? What is that?\" Katiya asks, raising her voice to speak over the shower.",
            "My voice echoes as I try to speak over the water. \"Basically, they appropriate your world for my people's amusement. They take all the good parts of the Middle Ages and mix it with fantasy, so people can pretend they're there without all the war and the disease and stuff.\" I skip out on hair, washing only pits and privates as I feel time drag me out of the shower and into the outfit I laid out. \"I get to wear the clothes you got me!\"",
            "\"Oh, I have to see this,\" Katiya says, as I toe the door shut, so she doesn't catch a glance of me transferring from towel to tunic. \"So it's like my world in yours?\"",
            "\"Basically,\" I say, and as I open the door to show off my peasant wear, I find another figure standing behind Katiya.",
            "\"Pray tell, what is this about?\" The catgirl says. \"Are you crossing over to our world?\"",
            "\"Oh, Rayna, good morning,\" I say.",
            "Her tail flutters, looking much lighter than she did yesterday. \"So you said you're going somewhere?\"",
            "\"Yeah.\"",
            "\"And I've decided I'm going with him,\" Katiya says. \"They gave me an off-day after the whole break-in. Called the defense a quest sheet.\"",
            "\"Oh. Well, I'm sorry about my part in that,\" Rayna says, and her ears lower when she looks down at the ground. \"But it sounds fun, though.\"",
            "A silence passes as I'm trying to apply deodorant and use a flosser at the same time. I watch her tail still flick in anticipation, as if she's begging a question.",
            "\"We talked about norms here — how dangerous your appearance can be in a world like this.\"",
            "\"For that streaming thing on the web, you were saying.\"",
            "I laugh. \"Yes. But also for the other reason, because there are only humans in this world.\"",
            "\"You said you thought my sister was one of those things when you first met her in the other world.\"",
            "\"A furry? Yeah. But that was more so, uh...\"",
            "\"Naya,\" Katiya says.",
            "\"Yeah, Naya,\" I say. \"Anyways—this and Halloween are probably the only two times you can pass at a glance, unless you're prepared to answer a lot of questions.\"",
            "\"I haven't even been out there yet,\" Rayna says.",
            "\"I think the two of you need a good break,\" I say. I glance at my watch: ten minutes from departure, and probably just enough time to rehearse. \"I have enough money here to cover you two for the day. You both have the gear, but I'm going to have to coach you on responses.\"",

            "\"And the ears? And the tail?\" Kei asks, getting Reed to tie the pirate corset behind her. \"How did you get those so perfect?\"",
            "I mouth the letters to her before Miguel makes it in my doorway.",
            "\"Eat...see. Eat-see,\" she says.",
            "\"Oh, Etsy?\"",
            "\"Yeah, that,\" Rayna says, then remembers, \"but you can't touch them, because they're fragile!\" ",
            "Meanwhile, I watch the door as Miguel gets that stupid grin on his face that makes me laugh: matching his costume in how it signals the mischief he's about to create. He wears the jester costume he got in high school, nursing a large handle of whiskey that's probably part of his \"Corolla Collection\" — the bottles that hide in his trunk for any situation — stumbling in with a silly walk like a divorced birthday clown.",
            "\"Ye for wherefore art thou drinketh this fucking handle,\" he says. \"Ye olde pregame, motherfuckers!\"",
            "Kei rolls her eyes: Katiya and Rayna look terrified at how someone could butcher their mannerisms of speech so savagely. And Reed laughs along, because he has the incredible skill to vibe with anyone.",
            "\"Whomst be the carriage driver?\" Miguel asks. He gestures to Kei with the open bottle. \"Milady?\" Then to Reed. \"My-fella?\" Then to me. \"Mi hombre?\" Then looks at Katiya and Rayna. \"Oh, shit, she brought a friend from work. Or does Cody have a new friend?\"",
            "Rayna's pupils narrow. Her tail frays, although she's been trying to keep it still to look like a shitty prop made out of large, black pipe cleaners — face awash with surprise like she heard a vacuum. I think she's about to dive under my sofa and hide until everyone leaves.",
            "But Kei plays it straight with him, just like in high school. \"Enough, Miguel. Cody said he's driving.\"",
            "\"So we're taking the van,\" he jeers.",
            "\"Fuck you. It's a hatchback,\" I say. \"If we took your car, it'd sound like fuckin' Jingle Bells from all the empties.\"",
            "\"At least we wouldn't be driving in a tampon.\"",
            "\"Miguel,\" Kei groans, but struggles to hold back a laugh. Then Reed laughs too: after so much corporate time together, he looks surprised that I have the capacity for a clap-back.",
            "\"Whatever. Drink,\" Miguel says. \"One shot from each of you. Even you, Cody.\"",
            "The liquor burns my mouth as I pretend to drink for a solid second, pressing it to my lips like communion wine. And then Kei gestures for us to head to the car, since she's always been in a position of default leadership.",
            "Miguel elbows me, whispering in my ear with the stench of booze on his breath. \"Who's that with Kei? Thought you were shacking up with her.\"",
            "\"Didn't work out,\" I whisper back. \"But it's alright. Life goes on.\"",
            "\"No kidding,\" my best friend says, \"when you've got . . .\" he gestures to Katiya and Rayna. They both glare at him like he's their town drunk.",
            "I can see Katiya trying to explain driving to Rayna, and suddenly I wonder if this could ever have been a good idea.",
            "\"Rayna will sit between Kei and I in the middle,\" Katiya says. \"Cody drives. Reed up front, and Miguel in the back. ",
            "Then Rayna mutters something, and Katiya nods, as Miguel asks me \"where the fuck I find these baddies.\"",
            "The drive over is nice. I thumbed through my music playlists for the shared one my fraternity still updates, titled MUSIC WHITE WOMEN TURN UP TO, since half the boring stuff I listen to would put them all to sleep. Reed somehow manages to get to know everybody single person in the car by the time we get there, Rayna gets over her jitters after ten minutes down the highway, and Kei and Miguel look wistfully out the window, probably nostalgic for riding in the same car we took between passing periods in high school.",
            "We pull off into a dirt lot. Someone flashes batons to the left like they're directing planes on a runway. I pass a twenty-dollar bill, get a parking pass, and we arrive at a parking spot on a grassy knoll spray-painted with lines, carefully stepping out in boots as we steady ourselves on the uneven ground.",
            "\"Try not to be offended,\" I whisper to Katiya and Rayna, as Kei naturally herds us to the gate. I withdraw the passes I bought at a discount from Costco, and it's only then that I notice the burdensome prop that Katiya carries.",
            "And Rayna carries one, too.",
            "\"What the hell? When did you load that in there?\" I ask.",
            "\"The swords?\" Katiya asks. \"I thought you said to treat this trip like I'm home.\"",
            "\"I'm pretty sure they only allow wooden swords,\" I say.",
            "\"Then why didn't you say something?\"",
            "\"Because I—\" let out an exasperated sigh. \"We'll figure something out.\"",
            "\"We can put them back,\" Katiya says. But we're already at the entrance.",
            "I glance between three ticket windows, scanning the long lines for anyone with a metal sword. The crowd lurches forward a couple people at a time as my friends chatter on: Katiya idles with a fire trick with her Essence.",
            "\"You can't do that, either,\" I say.",
            "\"Awe, come on,\" Katiya says.",
            "Then Rayna's ears perk up. \"Can I at least use some Essence to make this line go faster?\"",
            "\"Not that, either,\" I say. I see the first knight-looking strongman with a metallic weapon approaching the gate, and then it looks like he's asked to leave it in his car by management.",
            "I say, \"So I'm not sure that—\" but then the knight  gestures to a clipboard, and they hand him a form, and after he fills it out, they give him a badge and take the sword.",
            "\"He got in,\" Katiya says. \"What was the page?\"",
            "\"A waiver. Probably put a peace-bond zip-tie on his scabbard to keep it closed. I bet they'll give him something safer to fight with in the arena.\"",
            "\"Hey, let's pay attention,\" Kei says, and I realize we're at the front of our line.",
            "Some belly-dancer lady approaches us, wearing a wooden name tag emblazoned with the sigil of the renaissance faire. ",
            "\"Ho there, fair maidens!\" She says, far better than Miguel. \"Thou mayst not bear those blades within, save it be for honorable combat.\"",
            "I see a spark light in their eyes. Katiya says, \"honorable Combat, say'st thou? What meanest thou by that?\"",
            "\"Why, a chance to cross steel in our tourney ground, so long as ye sign the writ of waiver.\" She smiles. \"By my troth—fine armor ye wear, I wager that be the purpose for which ye wear?\"",
            "And Rayna says, \"Verily! Aye, forsooth—we shall fight for glory!\""

            "The first half of the morning goes on without much of a hitch. That was, until some toddler grabbed Rayna's tail before screaming KITTY! and launched her almost twice as high as a person should be able to jump. Then the child's mother told him \"not to grab things he doesn't know where they connect to\" — and since Rayna didn't get the connotation, I was lucky that I didn't have to explain it.",
            "I spent most of my time explaining Dungeons & Dragons to Katiya, after she saw some jewelry with the d20 on it. Reed and Kei walk together closely, though they pitch back a glance to me every so often.",
            "\"So your world had dragons?\" Katiya asks, brushing her hand against mine for the fifth time.",
            "\"Hell no,\" I say. \"We had dinosaurs, but they were here long before us.\"",
            "\"What are dinosaurs?\"",
            "\"Basically dragons, but they were given feathers instead of fire.\"",
            "\"No fire,\" she repeats. \"Seems like nothing in your world was given fire. How did your people get it?\"",
            "I think for a second. \"Trial and error, I guess,\" I say. \"Until one day, when someone rubbed the right two sticks together.\"",
            "She laughs. \"Your world is boring, huh?\"",
            "\"Depends on who you ask,\" I say, and I gesture to a goblin struggling to pay a jeweler with his phone. \"Our tech might make things easier, but we have just as many problems.\"",
            "Katiya gestures to the arena: between two real matches, tournament fighters in EVA-foam armor fight with swords made from taped towers of beer cans. \"At least yours seem to be less life-or-death,\" she says, as the audience doubles over with laughter.",
            "One petting zoo later, our party arrives at the food court, and Kei is quick to stake out the seats, assigning orders. I offer to wait in line, but Katiya and Rayna are excited to use another world's currency for the first time, and since Miguel and Reed are two extroverts of the same magnitude that point in opposite directions, they're already hitting it off as they chat in line.",
            "\"I'll remember your order,\" Katiya insists, pocketing three ten-dollar bills from my outstretched hand. It's only after they disappear behind a band of Scotsmen with bagpipes that Kei stumbles over saying something to me. ",
            "And it might be the last foreseeable chance we have.",
            "I speak first. ",
            "\"It's been a while since it's been the two of us, huh?\"",
            "\"It has,\" she says, and I can tell she's struggling to read me. \"Since the night we had together.\"",
            "\"Yeah,\" I say. \"The business.\"",
            "A laugh almost breaks her — and though I'm trying to make light of everything in my own way, to tell her it's alright, she insists on holding fast, watching the crowds to judge how much time she has left.",
            "\"I, uh, have a confession,\" Kei says. ",
            "\"I know,\" I say.",
            "\"Know what?\" She shifts her eyes to mine though her body points away.",
            "\"I know about the two of you.\"",
            "\"Oh,\" Kei says. \"So you do.\"",
            "She waits a little longer, refusing to look at me again as if she feels ashamed, as if she expects I'm searching for those feelings inside of her. But my voice is calm, and I face her directly.",
            "\"Look, Kei. I think you were the first girl I ever fell for. You've been such a good friend to me. Our families grew up together, and there's always been a special place I've had for you.\"",
            "\"That's sweet of you to say,\" she says, but leaves that sentence hanging, as if she's unsure whether she'll be the one to deliver the final blow.",
            "I look at my nails, then to our friends that have made it halfway through the line, then I look back at her: to find she's mustered the courage to say it directly to me.",
            "But I save her the grief.",
            "\"Every time I see you, I just get this feeling — some feeling that I think I lost the ability to make a long time ago. Like I left a piece with you, you know, and when you're around, I still feel the warmth of it.\"",
            "\"We've lived most of our lives together,\" Kei says. \"My family, your family, summer trips and all that. Say — you remember when Jackson used to jump the fence between our yards and let our German Shepherd chase him?\"",
            "\"Yeah. Buster. The one that wore the cone all the time,\" I say, laughing at the thought of little Jackson screaming in fear as he raced for the other fence line. \"And we'd watch from the play structure eating those shitty popsicles from the ice cream truck.\"",
            "\"That's why I always had a dollar-fifty in my pocket when I came over,\" she says. \"So we could take turns buying for each other. The picture always looked so amazing on the side of the truck, you know, the ones of the characters? But then you open the wrapper, and it's all melted.\"",
            "\"And yet we'd fall for it every day,\" I say, \"thinking it was just a fluke, that the next time it would be different.\" I look again towards the stalls. Our friends get closer to the counter, and I know our time is running short. ",
            "\"So why did we buy it?\"",
            "\"I know why I did,\" I say. \"I don't think it ever mattered if those disgusting, black licorice gumball eyes were missing or not, but I just remember the joy of giving my allowance so I could hold the both of them and give one to you, and it didn't matter who was buying. Seeing you happy was worth more than what it tasted like.\"",
            "She smiles, looking relieved. \"Then I think that small amount of joy was doing all the work the popsicle should have been doing.\"",
            "\"It did all summer, until your dad got the new job and you had to move to the next town. I was sad for a while, thinking you'd never have ice cream again without my allowance!\"",
            "\"Oh, it was awful!\" Kei says.",
            "\"But I don't know. I just look back on all those times together with such joy. It makes me happy to just know you can still find that feeling, and that's enough for me.\"",
            "I look to Reed, buying two large pretzels, and then to Katiya, struggling through her first transaction to get two burgers. ",
            "\"Even if we can't earn enough of that currency to support each other, the only thing that matters to me is that we have enough. Even if that exchange is with someone else,\" I say.",
            "\"Well, I hope you find that person,\" she says.",
            "\" I think I'm getting closer,\" I say. \"I love you, Kei, and I have for as long as I can remember. But I love to see you happy even more.\"",
            "\"And I love you too,\" she says. I hear her sniffle a little. \"And I'm sorry.\"",
            "\"No. Don't apologize for chasing what makes you happy,\" I say, as the others start to approach: Miguel trying to stabilize a foamy pitcher of Coors with plastic cups balanced on his jester's hat.",
            "She says, \"then just promise me one thing.\"",
            "\"What's that?\" I ask.",
            "\"To always stay close to me, Cody,\" she says.",
            "And I promise her."

            "\"You said you promised,\" I say. \"You said you'd let me win for him. So why are you fighting so hard?\"",
            "\"Those other fighters were nothing,\" Rayna says, as the two of us circle in the center of the dirt arena. \"I've got a taste for it again. I haven't fought like this since the Academy, and you're the only one that's put up a fight!\"",
            "\"Then it's no wonder you're so rusty,\" I say, launching another jab at her as she leaps backward. It's hard not to use Essence or acrobatics: Cody sternly told us not to go all out, saying we'd either get kicked out or end up working here.",
            "He cheers from the stands as the rest of the party chants our names, reminding me of the exhibition matches we held at seminaries — convincing young children to one day join our ranks. She said she'd lose so I could impress him, even though I never asked in the first place. But Rayna doesn't make it easy. I can tell she's stretching time in the narrow moments when she strikes, so fast that the rattan sword bends before it even hits.",
            "But I'm too fast, and the other four challengers were nothing compared to us. We rose up the bracket so fast that the Ring Captain asked us to stretch it out to fill the thirty minute time slot, taking out adults in silver-painted football pads in a single strike, jabbing them in the chest so hard that the end of the sword blossomed like a parasol before snapping back to its original shape.",
            "But Cody's eyes are the only ones I care about, even though so much of the faire has gathered around the hill to watch what was supposed to be a show-tourney. Half the audience cheers for \"Rayna The Cat,\" while the other half cheers for \"Katiya The Brave.\"",
            "There are even more that pour in by word-of-mouth, suspending the more serious ring of warriors that are allowed to fight with metal. I can feel my body respond so fluidly when I'm not afraid, blocking and dodging before my mind can catch up, and I whirl in spins of showful strikes as my adversary parries.",
            "\"If you're joining us now, not a single one has yet landed a blow, but they look like professionals,\" the Ring Captain says. \"This is the final match, and we've been at it for five whole minutes!\"",
            "She tries to sweep my feet, and I use Essence — just a little bit — to drive my muscles to propel me in the air enough to flip sideways. ",
            "The crowd roars. ",
            "\"That's not fair,\" Rayna says.",
            "I strike back. \"Then stop bending time, cheater!\"",
            "\"I'm not,\" she says, flashing her subtle fangs in a toothy grin.",
            "But she's less brazen after I get a sense of rhythm for the ebb-and-flow of the push-and-pull of time. She anticipates a strike and tries to slow my motion, but I feint, and by the time she's accelerated herself for a turnabout, I drive a blow against her chest, using her own energy against her.",
            "She staggers backwards as the crowd erupts with cheers. Someone asks to \"take my hand in marriage.\" And when I look up to the false king that rules this acreage, adorned with a crown embedded with fake rubies and diamonds, I kneel before him.",
            "\"Miss Katiya The Brave, you are our champion,\" he declares: voice omnipresent as it echoes through the speakers. The Ring Captain retrieves a plastic crown from a cardboard box labeled TROPHY CROWNS WEEK 12, putting it upon my head as Rayna comes to kneel next to me.",
            "And then another actor approaches from behind the king's miniature wooden castle: a prince, holding a rose as he approaches me.",
            "The King laughs. \"You have earned the right to take my son's hand in marriage,\" he says, although the two of them look nothing alike. He extends the rose to me and offers his gloved hand.",
            "But then I hesitate.",
            "\"Or is your heart already taken, milady?\" The king asks. \"Has another paramour already captured your heart?\"",
            "\"This is true,\" I say, turning around to look through the crowd as loads of bachelors reach toward the arena with both their hands. ",
            "He blushes as he sits there on the hill, too afraid to get up and embarrass himself, but when I gesture for him to approach, Miguel and Kei nearly throw him off the hill.",
            "The audience cheers when he takes his first steps. I feel I've gotten more praise than I ever will in all my life, even if it's all pretend, and as he shuffles nervously across the long stretch of dirt, I head directly for him, riding high on the mote of undeniable attraction I find in his eyes.",
            "He slows down as I get closer, as if afraid of what I'll do next in front of a hundred people, but Im speeding up as I reach out with my gauntlet, grasping the shirt I bought for him and pulling him in close, steeling myself for an emotional act of stupid bravery.",
            "I pull him down a couple inches as his face flushes further, and the audience cheers when the two of us make contact. It's just a brief peck, but I find my gauntlets grasping the back of his head as my other hand tenses in his shirt, feeling an arm wrap around my waist as we take the beat we've forestalled forever.",
            "I disengage when I remember the rules and the emotional high eclipses. But he's in good humor, and when I hand him the rose, acting like he's the feeble prince, the crowd laughs as he takes my hand.",
            "We make a point to wait for Rayna as she dashes across the field, and when I raise her hand, she gets the last round of applause before we disappear into the crowd.",
            "I mutter to Cody after circumstances catch up to feelings. \"I'm sorry if — I mean, it was just the high of the moment, playing the part, and—\"",
            "\"It's all good theater,\" he says. But after I release Rayna's hand, he still refuses to let go, maybe even holding tighter.",
            "\"How do you train for that?\" Miguel asks. \"And the damn flip, that was dope.\"",
            "I rehearse the cover story Cody crafted for me. my mind's so busy rehearsing plot points that I don't notice when the mood shifts — only when Cody's hand goes limp, and the three engineers pull out their phones.",
            "\"On a day off?\" Reed asks.",
            "\"It's that stupid lab thing,\" Kei says.",
            "The strength returns to Cody's hand, but it feels deliberate, and though he still holds it for the rest of the time we're there, refusing to let go, he never relaxes. ",
            "He's able to laugh just as easily with all his cherished friends on the car ride home. His fingers grip the steering wheel hard enough to choke the rubber, and if the others weren't here singing along to some song, I think I'd try to take his hand again.",
            "His face falls after the others leave and it's just Rayna and I. He says he's exhausted, though he has enough energy to find a drinking glass to vase the rose, and after the three of us watch movies for a couple hours, leaving Rayna with a blanket to sleep on the couch, we retire up to Cody's room to sleep separately together again, but he's snared in something. Hr still refuses to check his phone beyond setting an alarm.",
            "And it's then that I find the courage to ask, though he's turned away from me, facing the window.",
            "\"Are you alright?\" I ask.",
            "\"I'm fine,\" he says.",
            "I speak slowly. \"Do you want to talk about what happened?\"",
            "\"Just an email,\" he says. \"And I really don't want to work tomorrow.\"",
            "I rest my hand on his bare shoulder as I turn to face him, separated by only one sheet this time. I can feel him shake, and so I hug his back to my chest, trying to transfer a warmth beyond Essence, thinking maybe it will release something from him.",
            "And it does. ",
            "\"So they got the wrong guy,\" he says."

            "The pride of my fictional victory is enough to earn a restful night of sleep in Cody's bed, but it doesn't come to me quickly. We face in opposite directions with a sheet still separating us, and while I glance out the window to watch the metallic automobiles zip past beneath the miracle of electric light, I listen to Cody's uneven breathing.",
            "And it's not even that he's snoring or gasping — but they're short and heavy and persistent, and for the longest time, I hesitate to turn back around and address him, afraid I might be a bother. But sometimes I think I hear short mutterings — whether it's a curse or cry or a a whimper between breaths — and I'm sure I can feel him tremble in bed the same way he did the night of the break-in.",
            "After almost an hour, I finally find the courage to turn around and offer my warmth to him. My arm extends around his waist: and I try to pull him in: a position of protection my ex would never let me do, and whether Cody's sleeping or faking it, I finally feel his breaths rise and fall slower with less trembling in his throat.",
            "When I find sleep, I'm outside the cabin again, sitting there as I watch the sunrise, surrounded by all the ones I know and cherish. I'm telling my father of my day in Cody's mockery of my world: the tournament of challengers with fearsome names and lackluster technique. The stands of craftspeople my father would love to meet, with all their trinkets, odds, and ends, and I think another peaceful dream will find me for the second time — until the sun rises red with blood and I can smell the smoke in the air, itching my throat and burning my eyes until a loud screech shakes the entire town.",
            "But this isn't a dream I escape when I wake up. ",
            "The screeching follows from beyond the dream, and when I look up, the small white circles on the ceiling flash with small red lights as smoke fills Cody's bedroom, catching the early morning sun in cloudy beams through the window.",
            "The clock reads 6:40: Cody's gone because he said he had to go to work, and he must have just left. I was planning to do an evening quest, intending to sleep in for the first time in ages.",
            "But the screech is deafening as I throw open all the windows, bolting downstairs in my nightgown in case Cody left something on after making breakfast. My hands rise with Essence on-command to siphon the energy from any open flame, and though the smoke is worse downstairs, I don't sense anything emitting enough heat to warrant such a sightless plume.",
            "As I throw open the windows and turn on the electric fans, I realize the only other place it could come from, and my stomach drops when I come to the realization.",
            "The shattered window I covered with fabric did so little to prevent the overwhelming flood of ashen smoke from the outside air. My floor is covered with specks of black: some still glowing with heat from whatever unfolds beyond my walls, and with my connecting door left carelessly ajar, the specks have scattered onto Cody's polished floors.",
            "I rush back into my world of Gaffesend as I throw the door shut behind me, finding Rayna in a state of incontrovertible shock as she's crumpled on the couch.",
            "\"What the res are you still doing here? There's a fire,\" I say, \"we have to get out of here!\"",
            "\"It's not a fire,\" Rayna says, as muscle memory takes over for dressing into my guard uniform.",
            "I cough. \"What do you mean? What else could it be?\"",
            "\"It's something worse, and I think one of your friends was trying to get you. He knocked on the door frantically, saying your name. Then something about a town nearby, then about a major Essence event to the north. That Blackwater erupted.\"",
            "\"There's no volcanoes up there: what do you mean?\" I ask. I cough again before she hands me a clean dish towel to cover my mouth.",
            "\"There was a massive column of crimson and amethyst light that broke the clouds: so bright it must have woken everyone.\" She reaches behind her. \"And your friend left you something: he was knocking really hard until he slipped it under the door . . . looks like one of those—\"",
            "\"Quest sheets,\" I say. My eyes water, but I can so easily recognize the handwriting. It's the same sheet he tried to give me in the hospital, when I was too afraid to leave the town. And when I rush out the door, covering my mouth as I rue the fact that it looks like I slept in, I try to catch up with him, the world so obscured by the ash and smoke I can only make out the silhouettes of the townspeople as they rush past me."

            "When I rose from four hours of sleep, I found that same feeling of dread I found in college when the world finally caught up with me, when I remembered it was a heavy day of finals. But this was a test I couldn't study for.",
            "I usually leave no later than 6:30, but I awoke around 5:00, finding the knight still sleeping next to me. But it was like waking from a restless night with a severe cold, because once my conscious mind became aware of the great discomfort, there wasn't a chance I would be able to get myself back to sleep.",
            "I thought of leaving early. Maybe if I showered and made it in when the early risers do — like Reed and Kei — I could leave earlier and still finish eight hours of work, but then any odd action might be an admission of guilt, and surely they would know what I was trying to do. So I couldn't go in late, either: I would have to go in at exactly the same time, acting none the wiser, as if a wide-sweeping investigation wouldn't be stalking me as soon as my badge number registered on the door's security console.",
            "So all I could do was lay there with my thoughts like I did last night. Last night I was tempted to re-read the email for the tenth time, but I didn't want the bright screen to wake the girl sleeping next to me, and I knew it wasn't good for me either, so I just let the thoughts run their course like a fever until my mind was too exhausted to trouble me any further. By the time Katiya noticed enough to wrap her arm around me, suffusing me with the warmth of her otherworldly touch, I found just enough comfort to pass out.",
            "But now I rest uncomfortably as the room glows brighter with each passing minute, longing for another sense of touch and warmth. It isn't fear I feel. I'm more frightened of how unafraid I am, pulled back to the depths of my apathetic exhaustion that covers me like a wet blanket although the sheets that wrap around me are dry. Maybe last night I could find a couple tears before my body misconstrued my attempt at exorcising that long-forgotten emotion for a yawn, but as the clock finally reaches the time I'm set to rise, I only have enough energy to shower and dress myself. I wear Navidson-Monroe blue with the logo proudly emblazoned on the breast pocket, and I tuck it into jeans with a belt. My stomach is too empty to fill, so I bring nothing to work with me, fully expecting to be out by midday at a bar somewhere.",
            "The rain starts sometime before I pull out of the garage, and the ride is silent when music can't quell the anticipation: instead the raindrops patter in a continuous drumroll against the metallic roof; all sound without tonic or resolution.",
            "I'm walking up the concrete stairs before I even realize that I parked, and I can't even remember where. Dodging between hallways feels like playing paintball in close quarters until I make it to my desk at the exact average time I get in every day, but the discomfort catches up with me. Maybe it's the breakfast I skipped, or the sleeplessness, or the call of the void that left me without an appetite, dragging me to the bathroom to slam the stall door shut to get on my knees and lose the nothing I ate before this, dry-retching as someone else quickly washes their hands and vacates the bathroom.",
            "I wipe and rinse my mouth several times before I leave, turning the corner to start down the long hallway of half-height cubicles. Several unfamiliar heads float above the partitions on the left side — my side — and I frantically count how far down they are, whether they're looking for me, and whom they're talking to.",
            "But there's no stopping on the direct route to my desk, and I try to quell the feverish feeling as inevitability drags me closer, noticing they're in my row, asking Wilbur something.",
            "I turn the corner, ready to weigh the level of recognition in their faces. My heart races, but my face remains still, as I try to turn a play at confusion into a joke.",
            "\"You fellas lost?\" I ask.",
            "They respond with another question.",
            "\"Are you Cody Dunsmore?\""

            "When I arrive in the west-facing conference room, flanked by a phalanx of employees I've never met before, I find the shutter shades drawn so tightly that the only glow in the room comes from their laptop screens. From the long chain of tables spanning most of the room, with three chairs on one side and seven on the other, I can tell the seating is assigned since there's only one spot left to fill.",
            "Naveen sits in the left chair, and my father sits in the right, still refusing to turn and face me as the outlines of seven unfamiliar people on the other side of the table block the faint glow from between the shades.",
            "\"Why don't you have a seat, Cody,\" someone says, and I find my place between my two mentors. But calmly, and it discomforts me more than all the things I know are coming. Now is the time to be afraid: yet I find the fear isn't there, and as they shuffle through their manila folders for notes to start the meeting, I feel like I'm watching myself from the corner of the room.",
            "Usually I'm fighting the waves of my depression for a spark of energy, but for the first time, I'm almost glad there's nothing left. The representative from Internal Affairs opens his mouth to start us off, and I realize I might be too absent to feel the heat.",
            "The recorder clicks. ",
            "We state our names and the hour, and then they say they're only \"finding facts,\" and to \"say only what you know firsthand,\" and that \"there's no blame yet for anything.\" But when the still image of my silhouette shows on the first projector slide, I'm not sure I believe them.",
            "\"So there was something odd that happened late last week.\" The rep from IA drags his finger across a sheet of paper that's been meticulously highlighted. \"At five thirty-four PM, someone entered the advanced technology lab with Alan Dunsmore's credentials when he was already logged out of the system. And yet Alan was already clocked-out: he left at 5:08, within the ten-minute time window specified by his union contract.\"",
            "Alan's union rep nods, writing something down. The HR lady records the words on her laptop with a flurry of keystrokes, the only other sound in the room beyond the low hum of the outdoor heating unit. I feel my father tap his foot against the floor until he realizes we can feel it, and yet Nav is perfectly still.",
            "I can feel that first question coming, the one I've been waiting for since the email, and after a whole night of mentally debating myself over the best approach, I find I have no emotion left to obscure the clarity of the right answer.",
            "\"But Navidson-Monroe office staff are not required to clock out. Their badges are only read when they enter through one of the four office or warehouse doors. We do know, however, that an engineer's computer was active until exactly 5:23, when he logged out.\" ",
            "He's building the case with the anticipation that I'll try to deny it, and when he points his ballpoint pen at me, leveraging a cold, corporate stare that's devoid of malice, he finally gets to the question.",
            "\"And where were you, then, Cody?\"",
            "I clear my throat.",
            "\"At 5:23?\"",
            "\"Yes, around that time. What were you doing?\"",
            "\"I was logging off my computer,\" I say. \"That computer.\"",
            "\"And then, where did you—\"",
            "\"—I went down to the battery lab to test my prototype for the entry-level learning project.\"",
            "The room halts. The two men I'm sitting with turn to me, but it's not a gasp of revelation. It's a different surprise when they thumb past the first twenty pages of notes, expecting that they would have to work me over harder for the first confession.",
            "\"So it was you that was in there,\" the Lead says. ",
            "\"That's right,\" I say.",
            "\"And would you mind telling us how you got in?\"",
            "\"I was under the impression that it was an open lab, as long as the safety course was complete. I've been using the CAL-04 bench for the last month. I was told it would be left open for Reed and I to test our projects between other assignments.\"",
            "\"And who told you that?\"",
            "I turn to Nav, but not completely. I'm not trying to hang my boss out to dry, even if I know he told us on the first day.",
            "But he speaks up. \"No, it was I that told Reed and Cody.\"",
            "\"And who gave you permission?\"",
            "Nav starts, \"It was—\"",
            "\"—It's been an unspoken agreement for almost a decade,\" my father says. \"Any time there are entry-level engineers running their projects, we try to leave it open.\"",
            "And then the Quality Assurance director speaks. \"Gentlemen, there's a reason we have SOP's. It's so we can formalize these things.\"",
            "\"SOP's require tasks under billable hours, and this doesn't fall under that,\" Nav says. \"It's a rare case where testing is done for experience, not financial gain.\"",
            "\"But he certainly can't be operating without a lead present,\" the safety director says. \"The nature of these projects happening without operating procedures is a big problem we'll talk about later. But this engineer can't be in there without a supervisor!\"",
            "The Lead adds, \"was he given permission by his manager?\"",
            "\"He was not,\" Nav says.",
            "\"Then Cody,\" he asks, \"why were you in there?\"",
            "\"I was there because I'm running out of time to present my battery project, and though it's passable, I want to prove I can do even better.\"",
            "\"But your calendar says the presentation isn't due for another three weeks,\" the Lead says. \"If you have time, why did you choose to work after hours?\"",
            "\"I . . . I was particularly motivated that day.\"",
            "\"Motivated? As in...\"",
            "\"Pressured,\" I say.",
            "\"How were you pressured? Was it a coerced act?\" He asks.",
            "\"I was pressured to perform because it was the day I learned that management thinks I'm not good at my job. Or not good enough . . .\"",
            "\"Cody,\" Nav mutters.",
            "\"I wasn't raised to quit, but I was raised to work harder, even if my skills are subpar. I was in there to test a new idea I had for the project.\" The words anger my father, but he's not mad at me.",
            "The Lead closes the manila folder, perching with his elbows on the tan cover as he draws a deep breath. ",
            "\"Look, Cody, even if you were convinced you were finding a cure for cancer or had the noblest of reasons to be down there, it doesn't change the fact that the Department of Defense is . . . discontented, that one of their golden samples was disconnected.\" He opens the folder again, thumbing through pages of terminal records. \"We could ask about the strange results, and it would be fine to assume it's just an amateur operator. We could ask about the HVAC system reporting a significant chill when you ran the first test, but that isn't what matters. What matters is how we show reconciliation for a multimillion-dollar government project that costs tens of thousands of dollars a day, and the fact that the project was halted due to negligence,\" then pauses to look at me — \"negligence of someone that shouldn't be in there in the first place, and we have to provide corrective action.\"",
            "I bow my head as I await the final sentence. But my father's anger releases with an admonition.",
            "\"My son was just following instructions,\" Alan says.",
            "I say, \"there were no instructions. I acted on my own—\"",
            "\"I clipped the seal,\" Alan says.",
            "The entire room turns to look at him.",
            "\"I'm sorry, Mr. Dunsmore, what did you say?\"",
            "\"Dad,\" I say.",
            "\"I said I clipped the seal. I told my son he could use CAL-04 that day, and only realized I promised him after I started running the test. I'm not going to let my own son cover for my stupidity.\"",
            "\"Dad, that's not—\"",
            "\"I was going to run it the next morning. You see the test log was dated a day later?\" He gestures to the page as they flip through their folders. \"I was planning to run it the next day, and I figured I would just change the identification number.\"",
            "\"You're a lead, Alan. A technician level four, and you should have known better: we don't hot-swap numbers under the table!\"",
            "Alan's union representative looks confused at the revelation: he can sense the same lie that I do. \"Now, gentlemen and ladies, look, I think Alan is confused here. He just told me before the meeting—\"",
            "\"And you're saying you gave your son permission?\" The IA lead asks.",
            "I can see Dad rewriting history as we go along. His back is turned so I can't see his face. \"I bet you found he used my number instead of my card, right? Because I told him. 0-6-0-8.\"",
            "I say, \"But I clipped it. I clipped the identifier—\"",
            "\"Stop lying, Cody!\" My father looks furious. He sweats at his self-immolation.",
            "\"Then what about Cody's sample?\"",
            "\"He's an amateur,\" my father says. \"Just a stupid kid like his brother. So if you're going to punish anyone, punish me. You've ignored my son's efforts for three-and-a-half years, so why should you start noticing him now?\""

            "The men of the Dunsmore family are the best at taking bullets. And as the only one left whose number hasn't been called, I carry enough survivor's guilt for the three of us.",
            "I was prepared to be vanished today. The private sector dodges a lot of the slow, bureaucratic cycle of government, and I was sure they'd already drawn the documents for my termination, but they left themselves another option just in case. So after they got their pound of flesh through my father, I was no longer essential to taking the full force of punishment.",
            "Maybe the other technicians didn't notice when my father was escorted out of the large steel door because he wasn't wheeling out his toolbox. No matter the result, I would end up turning in my work laptop by the end of the day, trading one line of work for another, where I was forced to follow in my father's footsteps, stripped of the pride offered by my degree. As of Monday, November 30, I made the lateral transition to assume the role of an entry-level mechanical technician, survived by a rusty red box of tools that I still don't know the half of, left to look up through the office window at a realm that is no longer privileged to me.",
            "The only real explanation I got was from Nav. He gave me ten minutes in an abandoned conference room before they repossessed all my stuff, saying he would explain my plight to the others and mitigate all the humiliation, though I'd be the first thing they saw looking out the window to the shop floor. He was at least the one that tried to stand up for me: as they chose my fate in a few minutes, he protested that I was a new entry-level engineer being dropped like a hot rock into a competitive market. So after they decided to let me stay under austere conditions, Nav explained that it was \"my chance to walk away quietly, with a shred of dignity and a believable lie.\"",
            "I didn't even get to see my father after he left, but I don't think he wanted to be seen. I think his anger was real. I think he thought I expected him to save me: maybe he thought it was his role as my father to gish-gallop the room into a mess of threads that couldn't be untangled, painting the target on his back so brightly that they could only shoot him. The last I saw was the same expression he wore for months after he got the news about my brother, shouldering a crushing truth by only ever lifting with his back and never asking for help.",
            "I hate the way I am, but I can't separate myself from who I am, so I think I really just hate myself, and right now, I really, really hate myself. Has this apathy castrated me so much that I've lost the will to fight, or to care at all? What if I begged, or broke down, or got angry, or lost it, or whatever — enough to make them feel they got their justice? And what if I cared enough about my father's pride to extinguish his act of suicide?",

            "It's a new feeling that finds me when I'm rushing through the open streets, one I felt the day before when I heard Cody's voice cheering my name. It's an energy that races my circuits with the same signature of power but a different medium — like how human Essence can give rise to powers of both life and fire — and if Cody's faith in me lifted a sense of life, it's a fear for Bertram that blazes a fire.",
            "The feeling carries me through the streets in a rush: one hand holding Bertram's quest sheet as a tightly-rolled scroll while the other holds a damp dishrag from Cody's world to my mouth. Some civilians watch from the windows of their homes: others head south, shouldering enough provisions to wait it all out.",
            "It was supposed to be winter when the Chymaera planned their attack, and if the Essence event to the north is their handiwork, it's because Blackwater runs in a cold, eternal winter. Rayna left to pursue answers from her contact shortly after I left. All I know now is that Gaffesend is the last northern base holding the Purgatory Line — leaving Hillfar as no more than a burnt offering.",
            "He had to have returned to base, I think. There's no way he'd go alone. Maybe he was the only one that had some family stubborn enough to stay, but he'd wait for me. Why else would he slide the unsigned quest sheet beneath the door?",
            "I could rue my decision to sleep in Cody's world. I was told to take the morning off until the carpenters fixed my window, so I could scout into the evening, but now my absence is suspicious. The anger fuels me as I weave between civilians that march to the base for a sense of sanctuary, and when I break the threshold of the large, metal gates, I'm surprised when I find all of the junior guards sitting around.",
            "I catch my breath through the wet rag, saving me a cough as I search for anyone that I recognize. Sharp claws clatter against my shoulder plate as a nervous voice purrs behind me.",
            "\"Katiya, where have you been?\" Naya asks.",
            "\"I was meant to scout in the evening,\" I say. I turn to face her, finding our other friends leaning low against the perimeter wall. Paxton sits on the gravel floor, talking to Ryder as he reads a book, and there's only the two of them, dragging me further from any reassurance.",
            "\"Why are we all just standing around?\" I ask. \"And where's Bertram?\"",
            "She flicks her tail. \"Comms are down in all the surrounding areas. We've been ordered to stand by and defend Gaffesend, where we're in sight of each other.\"",
            "\"So It's foul play?\" I ask, then change my question immediately. \"But where's Bertram? Did you see him? He left this at my house,\" I say, holding a quest sheet.",
            "Ryder overhears my panic. \"He said he was going to fetch something he forgot from his house.\"",
            "Pax says, \"he was rambling about his cousins to the east. And then he heard about the comms going down. Said he had to grab something, and I offered to watch his stuff so he could get there faster. Then I went to take a piss, and he wasn't there when I came back.\"",
            "I glare at Ryder: he's the one that knows it all. \"I don't know. He went the wrong way to be going home: he was headed for the stables.\"",
            "The unease grips me harder. \"Gods damn it, Bertram. And when was this?\"",
            "\"A while ago,\" Ryder says. \"Long enough that I thought he might return with you: maybe forty-five minutes?\"",
            "\"Shit!\" I say: it's a curse from Cody's world, but finally, they're beginning to realize my cause for panic. They follow behind me as I sprint to the stables, and their speed rises with the same urgency of fear.",
            "\"There's no way he would do that,\" Pax shouts.",
            "\"They'd stop him,\" Naya says, \"right?\"",
            "My mind's too occupied with the last words I spoke to him. No. I can't think this way, I tell myself, but feeling and logic play on two different channels, and the feeling is taking over.",
            "I drag the heavy door open to the stables, and if I was any less exhausted I might have popped it off the rails. There's two other junior cadets that inspect an empty stall — Flint's stall — noticing all the excesses he left behind. Aryn lifts a broken necklace, the string tethered through a pendant he fashioned from the debris of that fateful night. And Jullian holds his bag, still full of all the scouting provisions he pretended that he left behind.",
            "The others catch up, circling the empty stall.",
            "\"It's Bertram,\" I say. \"Bertram left!\"",
            "\"We were ordered to stay,\" Aryn says. \"And he knows that. Why would he leave?\"",
            "I explain in a few breathless words.",
            "\"Well, he made his choice,\" Jullian says. I can see that fear in his eyes, but when he looks at me, it seems he can't find it. \"What, are you going to go after him? Command will be here in minutes, along with all the other senior guards. Our orders were to stay.\"",
            "\"I can't let Bertram die alone,\" I say. \"I made a promise to him, that we'd return together.\"",
            "I press against Ryder as he blocks the stall door, and he gives, disbelieving that my words could be anything but just talk. But he doesn't know the feeling that still burns in me when I think of my closest friend's face, realizing all the feelings I failed to tell him.",
            "I can't even remember the last thing he said to me.",
            "\"You steal a horse and you're cooked, Katiya,\" Jullian says, and there's a genuine fear in his voice — but now it's for me. \"What if it's nothing? What if the Chymaera aren't there, and there's no act of bravery to be had? Leadership will roast you alive!\"",
            "But I've already thrown open the gate and saddled the horse. I can hear Aldrin and all the other senior guards approaching the stable, but it feels like the result is now inevitable: just as certain as Bertram's fate.",
            "\"I'm still buried in Hillfar with my father,\" I say, climbing the dark horse named Soot after I untether him from the post. \"I'm saving Bertram, and I'm saving myself.\"",
            "I don't look back until I pass through the wide stable door. Aldrin and his royal knights dive to the side as Soot noses between them, catching a glance of my fluttering braid as I coax Soot to full speed, unable to hear whether the shouts behind me are admonitions of my commanding officer or the voices of friends I might be hearing for the last time."

            "The clattering of hooves ceases when I break the line between cobblestone and dirt. I fight the blinding smoke for enough vision to lead Soot as my eyes water, breathing shallowly in the space behind Soot's neck that he drafts with air. While Soot toils with speed, my mind races over coming up with a plan: something, anything to turn Bertram around and get him back home safe. ",
            "I race along the trail around the lake, the one I know from running every morning. For the longest time, I hear nothing but the wind whistling in my ears as we race through a long straightaway. It's only when we pass the limit of my runs, where the trail bends right to curve around a small cove, that the shouting finally has its chance to carry across the water.",
            "It's two voices, high and low, and when I listen closer, I can hear the rhythm of hoofbeats. I can't let them turn me around when Bertram is all alone: if I'm paying for my disobedience, I better spend every last Kine of it.",
            "The trail tapers off at a rugged delta of shallow streams, feeding south to Northaven from the high mountains, and though I coax Soot to go faster, he's confused at where to go. As Soot and I ford the first stream, kicking up splashes of river water as I goad him to run, I hear my pursuers gaining on me, and I refuse to look back until they dare to drag me home.",
            "I keep riding, riding carelessly, carelessly enough to distance myself, with only the thought of Bertram's fate twisting in my mind. The image is loud enough to drown out their cries, and by the time I've crossed the shallows, they've disappeared into the haze.",
            "I ride through the forest, beginning to recognize the landmarks from my furthest treks from Hillfar as a child. Soot gallops on without awareness of any danger, and it means my hesitation can't stop me anymore.",
            "That is, until I spot a felled tree on the side of the road tethered with a brown horse. The village is getting closer. These are the outskirts of where I used to walk, just beyond my father's sight where his shrill whistle could bring me home. Maybe the nostalgia would bring an air of peace if it weren't for the glow of amethyst in the bark, and the sound of commotion somewhere several hundred yards away.",
            "I tether Soot next to Flint, realizing all motion is now my own. My legs tremble, yet the feeling from this morning still resonates inside me, and I think it will be strong enough this time.",
            "This is courage, I think. This has to be courage, right? It all has to add to something!",
            "And just as I'm about to take the first steps toward Hillfar that I can call my own, I hear a twig snap behind me. I haven't the time to react before they respond to their own mistake in stealth, and then they tackle me to the ground, covering my mouth as I expect a cold, obsidian limb to skewer my chest.",
            "I'm about to scream before I realize the hand is warm. There's no dagger to my throat: the only sensation I feel is the deceleration of time as my adversary anticipates what I'll do next, and when I turn around, Aryn's eyes narrow with fear, as Jullian stands behind her.",
            "\"I had to be sure you wouldn't run — make the same mistake as your blockhead friend,\" she mutters.",
            "\"But why?\" I ask. \"Why did you follow me?\"",
            "\"I couldn't save my sister from her fate. But I can still save you,\" Aryn says, \"the one that inspired me to join in the first place.\"",
            "I look at Jullian for the first time since that night in the tavern. He's not jealous. It's not because he thinks he owes me. He looks afraid, and says, \"you know there's people that care if you throw your life away?\"",
            "\"I won't be useless anymore,\" I say. \"And I need to move before I lose the nerve.\"",
            "\"You need more than nerves. You need a plan,\" Aryn says. \"What are you here to do?\"",
            "\"To make him come home,\" I say. My voice trembles, and it's time for me to go.",
            "\"But how are you going to do that?\" Jullian asks. He shout-whispers as I head for danger. \"Katiya!\""

            "The chill of death is no different than it was all those years ago. The cries of the victims are just as hushed as they were in the siege when the village is so sparsely spread between the pines, but there are still the diminishing sounds of combat.",
            "I pass through a smoldered gate once carved by my father's hands. His handiwork lives on in all that's left of the intricate carvings: two burnt half-posts left from an arch that once had our village's name. ",
            "But my hands don't trace the pattern. They feel for the woven thread of the grip on my holstered blade. I'm the first to advance since I know the  landscape, passing through the exposed foyer of Old Lucy's cabin as I stare through the skeleton of a doorframe at the footprint of my old house.",
            "I tiptoe along the line of sight my father had, when Bertram and I used to paint rocks in Old Lucy's house. We head for the ghost of an edifice that's stood longer in my dreams, and as I struggle not to think where their bodies have been all this time, I hear the growing sounds of a dying resistance.",
            "Volleys of fresh obsidian shards stab the petrified charcoal like arrows. I pray the civilians had time to escape when all the human corpses wear the leather armor of the Hillfar Militia, interspersed with the dark-shelled bodies of crumpled Chymaerans at an even balance. The longing for his voice pulls me closer to conflict though all I want is just to call his name.",
            "I discern the first string of words when our backs lean against what's left of the log wall in my bedroom, but they're not human. It's a series of anxious clicks at low frequency, and my mind races back on a decade of training to translate them.",
            "\"You heard that?\" Jullian asks, racking one of the two rifles they stole from the stable's armory.",
            "\"Two words,\" Aryn says. \"Reinforcements. Soon.\"",
            "There's so few humans left to fight. Surely it's only the most stubborn ones that refuse to leave, and when I finally hear a human voice, I recognize it from my past.",
            "The memory of the first trial all those months ago flashes through my mind, and all the quiet nights of humiliation that followed, until the agony becomes worse than death and sets me over the edge, parting from the wall my father once built to pursue the friend who's saved me twice.",
            "Aryn's fingers slip through the fabric of my uniform when she tries to grab me, and I sprint for Bertram's old house across the way, dodging between trees as I find a stranger standing outside the rebuilt cabin's entrance. They shout for someone else that isn't with them, and when they turn to find the flaxen-haired girl with a scar that missed her eye and severed her brow, they recognize me in an instant.",
            "\"Miss Katiya,\" Bertram's cousin says, \"why are you here?\"",
            "\"Where is Bertram?\" I demand.",
            "\"He's pinned down somewhere south of the house,\" he says. \"Went to save his niece.\"",
            "I hear rifle blasts behind me: it makes them jump before he realizes it's human.",
            "Something grazes my leg.",
            "\"Gods damn it, Katiya! Get back here,\" Jullian says, and I see the two of them crouching behind the south-facing wall.",
            "But I'm not done.",
            "\"Where is he, exactly?\" I begin to say, turning back to ask the cousin. \"Tell me, can you point—\"",
            "An obsidian needle sticks through both sides of his skull. His eyes froze so fast that the fluid exploded, leaving icicles hanging in flash-frozen drips from his hollow sockets.",
            "Someone is firing on us from the west: a Chymaeran Shiver, launching obsidian quills as an off-axis overwatch.",
            "When I hear the whisper of something long and sharp splitting the air inches from my ear, I take his rifle from the ground and dive into the building.",
            "The floor is littered with toys I recognize from a past generation, and I suddenly remember Bertram's family did our schooling. The children must have made it out in time: the only forgotten shapes are just toys and dolls abandoned in the middle of play, and when I rush for the shattered back window, hearing the clicks of a couple Chymaerans advancing in a pincer, I finally catch a glimpse of Bertram holding his niece in a small shed.",
            "I have the element of surprise: I've been excluded from the Chymaerans' calculus, and with the loaded weapon in my hands, I'm prepared to either save him or die in a complete circle of life. My hands don't tremble when I steady the rifle on the windowsill, and when Bertram sees me in the window, I find a sense of hope reinvigorates him from helplessness.",
            "We trade hand signals. He's been pinned there the whole time, so he's surely counted everything around him.",
            "Three remain. Two left, one right, behind the shed, he signals, gesturing to each side of the shed, and shows he's holding a sawed-off shotgun. Then he points to a hole in the back of the shed.",
            "He surely means he'll be taking one of them, but I only have one rifle. ",
            "Their clicks are getting louder. They approach to find solace before their reinforcements arrive, and just as I'm about to signal that I'll try for both of them, Aryn and Jullian make it to my window.",
            "\"What did he say?\" Aryn whispers.",
            "\"Two left, one right. Bertram fires the first shot and we take the rest,\" I mutter, just as their long shadows begin to cross the backyard. \"Aryn's a deadshot. You take the one that's furthest to the left, and I'll take the other. Jullian shoots whatever's still standing.\"",
            "And then we see them. ",
            "I hold my breath when I find my position on the long windowsill as the others prepare to fight. Bertram instructs the little girl to cover her ears, then nuzzles the barrel into the gap as he uses a knotted hole to peek.",
            "The blast echoes across the entire village as the other two Chymaerans panic, watching their comrade's dark carapace explode into amethyst fragments. The Essence in my hands ignites the rifle that was only designed for wielders of fire. I pulse Essence to blast the one on the right two times and drop them: Aryn puts a round right between the left one's triangle of glowing eyes, and Jullian pops a round into each of them.",
            "Hillfar returns to dead silence: we're the only ones left again. I let the quiet hang a little longer as we scan the outside for any sign of the enemy, and when nothing answers, I call to Bertram.",
            "He cries tears of relief. \"You saved us, Katiya,\" he says. \"You saved me again!\"",
            "\"Saved you again?\"",
            "\"From the fire,\" he says.",
            "There's something that still feels off, but I ignore it. \"You're safe now,\" I shout. \"You can come back!\"",
            "Bertram takes the young girl's gloved hand, leaving the shotgun in the shed. \"Our circle is complete,\" he tells me, holding up his crumpled copy of the quest sheet.",
            "\"But Katiya, what shot you earlier?\" Aryn asks.",
            "\"Shot me?\" I ask, but I feel nothing. ",
            "I motion for him to come to the window as he guides his reluctant niece to his family home, directly out of cover.",
            "\"I mean, what shot you, in the thigh?\" ",
            "She gestures to the cauterized needle sticking through my leg.",
            "I never felt it. It must have hit when I was outside: I thought it was a graze. Which means there's one Chymaeran left I never accounted for.",
            "Aryn winces as she gestures to Bertram before the words can catch up.",
            "\"No, Bertram, go back!\" I shout, and I look back at the two of them, just before the plume of slender needles slice through the air.",
            "The one that pierces his neck freezes his mouth in a permanent smile, setting his eyes in panic. And  when another stabs into his brain, he dies with his face forever trapped between two complexions.",
            "Jullian reflexively pushes in front of me. I close my eyes before I can witness the rest of it. Their deaths are quick and soundless, beyond the thud of two rigid, frozen bodies collapsing to the floor.",
            "It's the first time I feel Aryn tremble, even if just a little. \"It's not over. Stay away from the windows,\" she says: the three of us are light on ammunition, with only our bladed weapons to resist a breach.",
            "My Essence floods the blade, heating the iron edge until it glows—a hairline of red running the full length of the steel. The metal chatters softly as the hotter iron expands within its colder body.",
            "\"Their reinforcements will be here any second,\" Jullian says. \"We have to get out of here!\"",
            "\"It was all for nothing,\" I mutter.",
            "\"That doesn't matter right now,\" Aryn says.",
            "Jullian counts the rounds in his pocket. \"We need  to take out the Shiver. I have four rounds.\"",
            "\"And I have three,\" Aryn says. Katiya has whatever's loaded.\"",
            "\"Covering fire,\" I hear myself say. \"I'll provide covering fire for you to get out of here. Give me the ammo.\"",
            "\"But how will you get out?\"",
            "\"I don't have to,\" I say, approaching the window before Aryn and Jullian both drag me back by the collar.",
            "\"You're not thinking straight,\" Aryn says. \"Your friend is gone — that doesn't mean you have to join him in the Reservoir of Souls!\"",
            "I try to resist as I sob uncontrollably, but it's three against one, and I realize I don't even care to check if there's anything left in the magazine. \"I failed!\"",
            "\"You tried,\" Jullian says.",
            "\"I saved him incorrectly,\" I say, and just as I'm about to make a little progress in resistance, we hear the sound of rifle blasts near my old home. ",
            "It's a human force, and when we peer through the north-facing windows, we see the red-and-gold standards of the Royal Guard.",
            "\"Shiver is down,\" a voice reports, and it's my brother's voice. \"They left the horses back there, but I seen them with the bodies. Dear Gods . . . Katiya,\" he calls out.",
            "\"If they're not dead, they'll wish they were,\" Aldrin replies. \"They're lucky our plan was to scout here in the first place.\"",
            "But not in time. ",
            "I shout the day's countersign while my adrenaline still blocks the mourning, and moments later, Aldrin and Erik step into the building."

            "The drawing reads REED because he forgets to use his last name. It was checked by SAKURASHIMA, then approved by PRADESH, and now the chain of custody ends in my greasy hands, putting it all together.",
            "The red toolbox won't be fooled by the hand-me-down fatigues that were just my size, because even if the woven tag reads DUNSMORE, and my likeness is spread across twelve Polaroid photos of my father and I — magnetized to the inner lid like a refrigerator door — I don't know what anything is for, and there's no father to explain it to me.",
            "The technicians all loathe me since word travels fast. They call me names in other tongues since I got their favorite friend fired. And at the bottom of the union pecking order, with about a week of seniority, all I build is just the sub-assemblies — or subs — with about three different screws I have to fasten in the holes.",
            "I circled the sheet with a red pen, the only possession that survived my \"lateral transfer\" since it was in my pocket. One of the holes on the drawings is deep enough, but Reed specified the wrong depth for the thread: probably just went with the default setting in the software instead of checking the parameters. It's something I could fix in minutes if I still had access, but since my new masters crack the whip — asking every hour when I'll \"get it done\" — I have no choice but to go exactly where I don't belong.",
            "My steel-toed boots sound different than when I once climbed the shop stairs in dress shoes: loud and heavy and cumbersome, leaving me no chance to sneak in and out of the engineering office. I skulk down the aisle of cubes as a stranger in a familiar land, fighting the urge to hide in an empty row at any provocation, but this is the fate I accepted. Nav said it was my chance to \"back away quietly,\" but I never took it: now I'm a remorseful ghost, longing for resolution for a time that long passed. ",
            "I approach the first set of the Battery Team's cubes for the first time since the last time. I'll pass my desk before I make it to the row with all the others, and when my heart can no longer take it, I dip into the lone row I shared with Wilbur, too weak to go straight to the source.",
            "My old mentor speaks in a hushed tone, but he's amiable. \"So good to see you, Cody,\" he says. \"You deserve so much better than what happened. And all of this.\"",
            "\"I expect nothing anymore,\" I whisper, but sulking won't get me changes. \"Anyways. Can you . . .\"",
            "I peek over the wall. Reed's still loudly talking, and it's useful in masking my voice.",
            "Wilbur says, \"Can I?\"",
            "\"Can you get Reed to come out real quick?\"",
            "I know it's lame, but I can't bear it yet.",
            "\"He's in. He's right over—\" and then he pauses once he realizes what I mean. \"Yeah, of course. I'll send a message,\" he says, then checks his watch. \"In one minute. So you have time to escape.\"",
            "\"Thanks, Wilbur. I—\"",
            "\"Cody,\" Kei says. \"Feels like I haven't seen you in forever!\"",
            "I hear the others rise from their chairs in the other aisle, filing out once they hear my name.",
            "\"Oh. Hey,\" I say, picking at a stray thread on the insignia of my father's fatigues. My eyes never meet hers.",
            "\"What brings you up, brings you . . . here?\"",
            "\"A little issue with one of the subassemblies,\" I say. Reed approaches from behind her, along with the rest of my old team. I regurgitate a laugh as I suppress the urge to run. \"Guess I'm the one writing redlines now, huh?\"",
            "I hold the drawing between two hands to keep them from trembling.",
            "Kei asks, \"what's the problem?\"",
            "\"Mis-spec'd a tap hole for a #10-24 UNC fastener: thread depth should be longer. I remember the default from SolidEdge — must not have been changed. Need a revision before I re-tap it.\"",
            "\"Sure thing,\" Kei says.",
            "I hand it to Kei, and she hands it to Reed.",
            "I stand there empty-handed as they look it over, and in the silence, I run my mouth again.",
            "\"You know, I'd do it myself and all, but...\"",
            "They chuckle. Because there are no words they can respond with that won't cut me.",
            "\"So yeah. That's all,\" I say, but they're still blocking the aisle: maybe searching for some last sentence of reassurance, but nothing comes to them.",
            "So we stand there. By habit, I almost sit in my old seat, but the desk was already cleaned out by the old janitorial staff, and my hands are so dirty.",
            "\"Sure,\" Reed says, folding the copy of his drawing. \"I'll be out in a sec.\"",
            "\"I just need a revision. I'll check the updated drawing.\"",
            "\"I insist. It's my bad,\" he says, as the others return to their row with a morose look, whispering something to Kei before I pass them.",
            "\"Well, you know where to find me,\" I say. ",
            "I look out the window to the shop floor, where the lone red toolbox is still open, and minutes later, I'm staring up at the same spot I once stood, as two engineers descend the stairs instead of just one.",
            "I'm not entirely sure why I do it, but I turn to the table to look busy, recalling the scant description of the task:",
            "You take your finger, put some of the greasy \"oo\" on it, scosh it a tad 'till the Allen wrench fights 'ya a little, and keep it in the fingers, 'cause sore wrists means a bad sex life.",
            "I'm saving my wrists when they show, and I don't turn around, using words instead. \"Got the drawing, saw it on the shop computer. I'm good to go.\"",
            "But Kei puts her hand on my shoulder. \"There's something we wanted to tell you, but the timing never seemed right,\" she says.",
            "\"You have nothing to apologize for,\" I say. My hands strain at the hundredth sub I've built today, callousing my pink palms beneath the gloves.",
            "\"It's not an apology. It's a fact,\" Reed says. \"And I owe you a drink: Kei tells me it's your birthday today. So can you meet us after work?\"",
            "\"Where?\" I ask."

            "\"They tried to call, but I couldn't bring myself to answer,\" I tell Kei and Reed. \"I feel like an asshole. But, birthday or not, I'm just not ready to talk yet.\"",
            "They sit across from me in the booth, and we look like we come from two different worlds from the color of our collars. Kei swirls the large cube of ice in her old-fashioned, and Reed scratches his head, looking like he hesitates to say something.",
            "\"What is it?\" I ask.",

            "\"He was a year ahead of me at CU Boulder. I followed him, since we come from a family of engineers and engineering managers, mostly at Navidson-Monroe. And he had this . . . spark . . . that I guess I never inherited — 4.4 weighted, out of high school with a Harvard-level ACT score.\"",
            "My calloused hand leaves the glass as I look in his eyes. \"But what do you mean, 'had?'\"",
            "\"I don't mean to offend you since you actually lost someone,\" Reed says. ",
            "\"No, not at all,\" I say.",
            "\"But it feels like it. He burned too bright, too fast. He was more like my mother: my father could work a room, but she could work nothing into anything. He taught himself guitar in a week, and piano in another two. He brute-forced high school and earned his place as valedictorian: got first place in the race, but traded paint with just about damn near every guardrail to get there, and didn't have it in him to change in college. And he gave up.\"",
            "\"Like he didn't finish?\"",
            "\"Pretty much,\" Reed says. \"My parents' expectations never changed, just like his approach to life, and he dropped out entirely, from everything.\"",
            "\"And you were the last legacy left,\" I say. \"Just like I was.\"",
            "\"It's like racing an Olympic athlete that gets a heart attack before the finish line. So I'm in first now, but did I really earn it?\" Reed says. \"You design with brilliance, just like my brother did, and you actually feel it.\"",
            "\"And you don't?\" I ask.",
            "\"I play the game,\" he says. \"People like me end up as managers. But people like you and my brother belong on the cutting edge.\"",
            "Kei adds, \"and I know you still have that passion. You had your day in the national spotlight for that senior project!\"",
            "Reed turns to her. \"The drone thing, right?\"",
            "\"He designed a surveillance drone prototype, in honor of his brother Jackson. Made the news, and he did a whole bunch of interviews.\"",
            "\"See?\" Reed's fists hit the table. \"That sounds exactly right!\"",
            "\"What ever happened to it?\"",
            "\"It's in a box in my garage somewhere,\" I say. \"Now that I think of it, I should probably take out the LiPO battery before it explodes.\"",
            "Now it's Kei's turn to hesitate. \"Speaking of batteries — well, there's another reason we asked to talk outside of work beyond your birthday.\"",
            "My eyes widen. \"Oh, espionage, my favorite subject!\"",
            "\"But really. The events are so fresh that it was hard to bring up before, but I found something.\" The cube is smaller when she swirls the glass this time. \"Is it okay to talk about it?\"",
            "\"Uh, yeah, of course,\" I say. \"It was a stupid indiscretion on my part.\"",
            "\"But there's more to it. I was looking at the security request, and realized it wasn't human.\"",
            "\"Human? What do you mean?\"",

            "\"I'm fine,\" I say, taking the last swig of my beer. \"Or maybe an iced tea, unsweet?\"",
            "\"Water here,\" Reed says.",
            "We turn back to Kei, who's reorganizing her thoughts. But the waiter still waits on her answer, and takes a while to notice.",

            "\"So sorry,\" the waiter says. \"Did you say sweet or unsweet?\"",
            "\"Unsweetened,\" I say.",
            "Kei says, \"The ticket was filed the same night as your 'fuck-up,' as you call it, but it wasn't escalated by a human. Your access was just an automated flag that should have been dismissed at the first tier, not raised to Internal Affairs!\"",
            "\"That doesn't change the fact that I clipped the battery,\" I say. \"Even if I was allowed to be in there after the training.\"",
            "\"But it shows nobody was targeting you. They think it was escalated by evidence of fraud or sabotage, but it was just a glitch!\"",

            "I wait a little longer.",
            "\"—it was filed by the system?\"",
            "\"You broke nothing,\" Kei says. \"It should only be a slap-on-the-wrist. But they had the wrong assumptions going into it!\"",
            "\"That's great and all, and I thank you guys for all your concern,\" I say. \"But I'm not going anywhere. I'm worse off than where I started, and I better look elsewhere if I want to work in an office.\" The overtime is killing me just to keep up on my mortgage. I can barely afford groceries after the last salaried paycheck hit.",
            "\"Kei wasn't the only one looking for compensation,\" Reed adds. I'm about to take a bite of my burger after removing the pickles, but he stops me. \"I have connections through my family — like I said — and maybe Aerospace's distance from the battery division gives them the perfect separation.\"",
            "I feel a little bit of something radiate inside me: something I thought I've lost for good, and it scares me. \"That's nice of you, Reed,\" I say. \"But—\"",
            "\"No,\" he says. He takes my hand, and now all the three of us are holding hands. \"Listen to me, seriously. I talked with some family friends, and they said they've got an opening.\"",
            "\"I'm in hot water right now,\" I say, and I remember that email from all those months ago. \"I don't even know if I'll make it past those winter layoffs they told us about in the spring!\"",
            "\"Who knows: we're not safe either. But they said they've got a showcase, like a brown bag event, for employees to show off their projects, and I think I can get you in.\"",

            "\"Oh yeah?\" I say.",
            "\"Yeah, you're worth it, Cody,\" Reed says. He fiddles further with his phone, and then I feel a notification vibrate my pocket. \"You get two slides and five minutes. Just give me some time to 'play the system' a little: I think I can get you in the room.\"",

            "The warmth from their kindness lasts until I get off the highway: it's not from the single drink I had, because I'm fully sober. Maybe it's because I've been listening to music and audiobooks all day to make it through the grind, getting home so exhausted that I just pass out instead of letting all the life I haven't processed catch up with me. I haven't been clearing the rock from the hole I've dig myself into, and at bedrock, I'm afraid of going any further.",
            "But I'm not going home. Instead of turning off the off-ramp like I always do, then a left and two rights until I'm turning in the driveway, I go straight, getting back on the highway as dusk turns to night.",
            "For the first time all month, my music isn't on, and I roll down the windows despite the freezing cold, even opening the sun roof until the wind screams and pops my ears. My foot is heavy as I accelerate onto the empty, two-lane highway that snakes down past Shaleborough, and gets heavier the more I gauge how much I still care.",
            "I try to displace all the pain of this change in my vocal cords, trying to out-shout the scream of winter winds as my foot gets heavier and the glowing hand of the speedometer crawls around the number wheel in even tens, until the car begins to shake and I'm getting speed wobbles like I'm on a longboard, and I finally find the last, ungentrified dirt road of my hometown that turns off the highway.",
            "It's the only road left that will take me to the place I used to think. It's where Miguel and I smoked our first cigar and talked about fate. It's where we took Homecoming pictures, facing the grand panorama of the Rocky Mountains atop the stark cliffs, and it's where I've taken three of my ex-girlfriends on a picnic date.",
            "My body aches from all the unfamiliar exertion of turning a wrench on the floor — especially my hands, but that's probably because I've been pounding the steering wheel like a madman, racing the engine of my poor car as I drift on the dirt road like it's a late summer night in high school.",
            "I'm still as alone as I've been since I got here: not a single car on the road, and as my anger quickly exhausts itself and trades for the emptiness of a finite sadness, I'm afraid of where I'll be when I run out of emotional currency and end up in my final state, the void.",
            "But it doesn't stop me. I scream differently from a different emotion when I crest the hill and begin along the long, dirt road tracing two hundred feet from the edge of the stark hill, accented with sandstone boulders that would give height to a long fall. I lack friends, cigars, picnic lunches, or even a jacket, but that's never stopped me from going down there before.",
            "I park on the side of the road in the porch blackness: to my back is a wide and empty field of grasses, and to the side is the lot where teenagers used to fuck. It's too cold for anybody else, and as my breath leaves my body in clouds, I leave my car behind on the side of the road and try to return to the lookout rock where everything once made sense.",
            "It's freezing: my car read 30 degrees Fahrenheit, but I've always been warm-blooded, and as I descend through the shrubbery after climbing the fence and passing the graffitied sign that reads DANIELS PARK, my body begins to shiver, but I think it's the only way I'll rest without pain.",
            "The rock is the same way I left it. Miguel and Jackson and I used to hang our legs over the side of the highest point in the park for the sense of adrenaline, staying out late on summer nights until the stars came out, or a cop's flashlight filtered through the bushes. But I lay with my back against the freezing rock, looking out across the blanket of stars that are indistinguishable from the lights of distant streetlamps on the front range, as a river of white-and-red lights at the foot of the mountains weave in opposite directions.",
            "I begin to shiver. I don't have Essence like Katiya, and in this game of chicken I wonder how long I'll stay here. I imagine the headlines if I took a single half-roll, or if the cold numbed me enough to peacefully fall asleep. Reed hasn't known me long enough to care, but Kei would be hurt for a while. Katiya would move on in her own world. My parents would be devastated to lose their last son, and I realize that I think that's the I oh thing keeping me on the edge here, shivering, yet still refusing to cede to all the things behind me, away from the ledge.",
            "I wonder how much it would take to set me off — Wallace said it was like jumping from a burning building, and no one understands what could ever bring you to do it — because they don't understand how preferable jumping is to the fire and smoke.",
            "My muscles tense. I let my mind race with those manufactured premonitions, then how I'm being pathetic and dramatic, then back to the abandonment I feel as I let my muscles tense as if to roll.",
            "I feel a vibration in my pocket, then nearly drop my phone three stories in my frozen hands that struggle to hinge. My fingers barely register on the touchscreen, but I bring it to my face, deciding to read one last birthday message.",

            "\"I wish we could have seen you. I know things are rough right now, but it means a lot you took the time to call. We love you taller than the mountains and brighter than the sun,\" Mom says, as I watch the light fade from the sawtooth edge of the mountain peaks.",
            "\"And I love you too,\" I say.",

            "And then I hang up.",
            "It's not enough to get me up yet, but I sit with my back against a protrusion in the rock. My Lock Screen is still of that day at the Renaissance Faire: the picture Kei snuck of Katiya kissing my cheek.",
            "I look up in the sky on a cloudless night, finding cold, dead stars whose light took more than a thousand lifetimes to reach my eyes, and revel just enough to bask a little in the smallness of my perspective, finding kinship with my impermanence.",
            "A little later, I grab the first stone I find on the ground and deposit it in my pocket, heading back to the car as the cold chills every joint in my body, turning the ignition as I warm my hands over the heaters: not feeling better, but just deciding to ride it out.",
            "I'll live the next five minutes. And in another five, I'll decide to go another ten. And after a while, maybe I'll find it in me to let myself feel just enough hope — enough to start thinking about the last shot I have before the culling of winter layoffs."

            "The shame forces my glance to never leave the bodies. I stand at the back window, watching twenty-some Senior Guards walk the landscape southeast in a perfect line. Several analyze the remains of my best friend: his face still frozen between relief and fear, separated only by the words of my ignorance.",
            "\"And you know that, Katiya, right?\" Aldrin asks.",

            "Aldrin creases his brow with his fingers. \"Recommended expulsion, is what I mean. A Royal Knight follows orders, and as soon as they stop doing that...\"",
            "The guardsmen wear gloves as they bend over to pull the long, slender shard from Bertram's skull. I can't look away: maybe it's because I'm too afraid to face him. Or maybe because this is the last time I'll ever see him, so I better take it all in.",
            "\"Graduation is in a month, and only two of you are in good standing,\" Aldrin says. \"Katiya. Katiya, you need to look at me!\"",
            "But it's hard. My brother has to grab my shoulder to turn me around, feeling like every second less I scan my cherished friend is another detail I'll forget.",

            "My brother looks down, then takes three steps back when he sees the bloodless spike impaled through my thigh. \"Khiras above, Katiya, what the fuck?\"",
            "\"We need medical here,\" Aldrin yells. They see the tears streaming down my face when they finally look up from the crystalline spike: I've only been facing them for moments. \"How could you be so careless?\"",
            "\"She gave the orders that allowed us to take out the three of them over there,\" Aryn says. \"She was calm under fire. And this was real.\"",
            "\"She took a hit and still fought on.\" Jullian says, trying to persuade further by gesturing with his hands.",

            "I can feel the weight of the key still in my pocket: the key will surely get even lighter with a different name on it. I should feel fear at what awaits me, afraid I'll end up like Aryn's sister, but the shame is too much to bear.",

            "\"Katiya, you are hereby suspended from the Royal Guard, pending tribunal. You are allowed residence in the same house until the announced date, which will follow shortly — and you are to not engage in any duties of protection, patrol or otherwise. You are suspended from carrying weapons. This sentence will hold until your hearing,\" he says, then gestures to Erik. \"Go on. This is no place for them.\"",

            "The ride back is a whole lot slower. This time Soot carries two of us: my brother and I, as Jullian and Aryn ride behind on their own horses. The impalement is still there: medics cut the obsidian down with red-hot iron using the Essence blade I'm no longer privileged to, filed it down, and wrapped it. Looking over Erik's shoulder, the haze has almost cleared enough to see home.",
            "I hug Erik's waist, wondering how many times left I have to spend with him. The adrenaline fades away so it's just the fear, and the only numbing agent I find is the shame telling me I deserve all of this.",
            "It's all quiet beyond Soot's huffs at carrying a heavier load. It seems the three of them are still trying to find words to speak, but haven't found the right approach.",

            "\"It was the night in the field,\" I say, \"when the Chymaerans toyed with us kids for their amusement, I got it trying to escape!\"",
            "\"There were no windows for Bertram's family to escape. They were only still alive because the room was so tall it collected smoke. The burns on your hands healed with Essence — but that debris you pulled from the door that trapped them, it cut you,\" he says. \"You pulled the beam wedge from the jamb. The nail cut your face. How do you not remember?\"",
            "\"All I remember is running away. With you, and Mom, and Bertram, and his family.\"",

            "I think of his smile, his touch, his nervousness around me. And he won't be three doors down anymore.",
            "My brother clears his throat before whispering another hesitation. \"You know, I mean it, not losing someone else. You weren't old enough to understand what it did to Mom, and if it happens again . . .\"",

            "\"Absolutely not,\" I shout behind a whisper. \"I'd kill myself down there, just knowing I was a damn deserter!\" Aryn's perceptive ears surely heard that, and I see her nod in my periphery.",

            "\"No,\" he says, but that's all he can muster. I'm sure he'll try to ask again before the tribunal, and half an hour later, when we arrive near the stables, Ryder, Naya, and Paxton have their questions.",

I worked on the prototype and sped through it for three solid hours, making a model for my 3D printer to run as I wrote all the code in C++ for fast execution and idyllic control system latency for either the proportional-integral-derivative or lag-lead compensator to operate with a minimal zeta value so long as the eigenvalues place zeroes and poles on the left half of the j-omega axis in response to a step or ramp response of the actuators accounted for with a simple mechanical model that considers damping and mass in the plant that implements a second-order transfer function.",

            "I find this catharsis comes without a sense of relief: just a return to circumstance. The warmth of my friends and their care for me lasts longer than the cooling bathwater, and as I use all my self-control to sit in this moment and not get distracted by my phone, it gives me just enough space to start to imagine what my next couple days might look like. And when I look at my distorted digital watch through the still water, reading 12:37 AM, I grab my phone for one last good excuse.",

            "It's the refugee crisis that's kept the Royal Guard distracted. Ever since some mountain in Blackwater blew its top, a steady stream of human refugees flows through Gaffesend, headed south to the capital to start again.",
            "I've met with my friends during the last couple days, no more than a civilian in this town that rejects me. Ryder insists that this event is what he's been waiting for, taking up an oar for every ferry ride from dawn to dusk to ask if anyone knows a Romin or a Raine, hoping for any connection to his past up north. I spend my days outside the house because I feel too unworthy to enjoy the comforts of a roof and walls. The only event that goads me forward is saying goodbye to Bertram at his closed-casket service.",
            "Five days pass slowly since my dereliction. I can't wear my armor or carry a sword: I can't even stand in the Guard's formation as they carry him to his final resting place, exactly where he passed, to be buried alongside his niece and all the other siblings he lost twenty years ago.",
            "I surely won't be honored like this when I'm sent to hold the Purgatory Line: maybe not even a box, from what I've heard. But maybe I was meant to die all those years ago, and maybe this was all just a farce, and maybe I should have stayed in that pit with the bodies until I became one of them.",
            "But the machinations of this ceremony don't do me any service. This is my last chance to see the town I was born into, and the safest it will ever be, so I decide to slip from the thin line of observers on the path to his house. I already saw him, but I never made peace with the land we came from.",
            "The stone wall is the same as it was twenty years ago. The trees got taller, and so have I, when I realize all I have to do is jump from a rock to get to that first branch that Bertram and the twins once crawled across. I shoulder myself over the stone wall before anyone can notice, heading east on memory of the terrain when all the foliage has died and regrown several times over.",
            "I feel the same eyes on me this time, as if those Chymaerans stood still for decades like the trees — just waiting to reclaim what they failed to catch, but if it's the last day I have to live, I want this game to end.",
            "The field is smaller than I remember, but even with the approach of frost, the landscape is verdant and beautiful, without a line of dirt unearthed by Chymaeran hands. Where once the victims of war were left in shallow graves, their dead Essence recycled into saplings and shrubs and long grasses. So much wildlife now inhabits the expanse beyond Hillfar, because nature doesn't care for the petty squabbles of the overly-conscious. I sit with my back to a massive tree where the pit once was, feeling the pleasure of shade as a light dusting of snow graces the air. A tremendous resonance of energy feathers my circuits as I think I'll fall asleep, with no intention to wake again.",
            "The funeral is surely over by now. There's no other event left to wait for, to separate me from the tribunal, and as I begin to drift off to sleep, I'm interrupted by the kick of a stranger against my boot.",
            "\"What are you doing here?\" A man asks. He looks slightly younger than me, with piercing, dark eyes and jet-black hair that make me think he's weathered several lifetimes. \"Are you one of us that has nowhere to go?\"",
            "And then a beautiful woman with silken, dark hair steps from behind him, a couple inches taller. The crimson rings in her eyes match the vibrant ends of her hair.",

            "\"This is Gaffesend,\" I say. \"And you're headed for Northaven?\"",
            "\"Whatever is left of it,\" the man says, scratching his thick beard.",

            "\"And my name is Sylvia,\" she says. \"Just Sylvia. And we're refugees from the North. We used to be Royal Guards just like you!\"",
            "She helps me to my feet, and somehow, I entirely blank on the macabre premise of why I was out here.",
            "\"What did it in for you?\" I ask.",
            "Titus itches his arm, where hundreds of scars — like threads — look like they were excised one-by-one. ",
            "\"We blew up a mountain,\" he says.",
            "I laugh, but they look serious. Then they laugh, and I laugh with them. ",

            "His eyes narrow. \"What Ryder?\"",
            "\"You wouldn't know him,\" I say.  ",
            "Titus pauses longer as if to add something, but drops it, just like the lead of the sled that he's been dragging, with enough items to get by.",
            "I feel some hollowness speak for me. \"Say . . . if you're passing through, I have a place you can stay for a little while.\"",

            "In the long, dragging years after college, I thought that all I could ever want was to waste my life as efficiently as possible. ",
            "But I feel something different now as I sit in the foyer of a home I can barely afford, watching the first snow of the year lightly fall beyond the glass of my front window, sitting in a folding chair as I consider everything that brought me to this exact moment.",
            "While my mind deliberates over whether I was actually going to kill myself — or just being pathetically dramatic — I still shiver from either the chill of the outside air or fear of the inevitable. Maybe my body refuses to forget what I almost did to it, even if my mind has moved on. I sit there for what feels like hours, entranced by the stillness of the outside world as the crystalline flakes glow like fireflies beneath the street lights. My phone is still in my hand: the group text written but still unsent, and I try to draw the energy to care just a little bit more.",
            "Some time after my meager patch of brown grass is covered in a layer of white, I hear a disturbance next door. Katiya's entry door screeches open at an improbable hour in the middle of the week, hanging open a little longer than it might take for a single person to get inside.",
            "My eyes turn to the seven-segment neon numbers on the stove, reading a little after two o'clock in the morning: it's far too late for Katiya when she hates drinking. ",
            "With how early she gets up for patrol, she should be asleep by now.",
            "So I grab my lacrosse stick again, scratched and battered to hell, and I stumble through the darkness towards the door as a strange wind flows out instead of in, and though I'm weaker than a peasant in Katiya's world, I decide I'll try for a bluff if I have to.",
            "I  slip through Katiya's door, rushing in with the sharp end of the stick leveled, ready to confront whatever faces me. But she doesn't have the energy to tackle me this time. ",
            "And it's not because I'm no longer a stranger. ",
            "Katiya stands at the entrance of her home. Nothing shines on her because she's dressed like a civilian, her hair disheveled and unbraided, and her skin sullied with dirt and grime. It looks as if she hesitates to enter her own home. I think up a joke to lighten her spirits, but quickly find it isn't the time.",
            "\"You never knocked,\" I say. \"For a whole week or so. I don't think I ever even heard you: quiet as a seminary mouse.\"",
            "\"And neither did you,\" she says, and sniffles, though I'm unsure whether it's from the elements.",
            "But it doesn't matter, because it's my chance to be warm for her, whether or not it's because I need it, too.",
            "I rest my lacrosse stick against the wall with her greatsword, and swiftly approach her. She trembles, still hesitating to enter like a vampire without verbal permission, so I wrap my arms around her, goading her to join me on the IKEA couch we spent a weekend afternoon jamming into her world.",
            "She doesn't say anything, so I listen to her silence. I can feel the rise and fall of her chest as she tightens herself against me, wondering what catastrophe could ever bring the strong, resilient knight to her edge like this. ",
            "I look down at her head that's coated in leaves and branches, and as I rub her back, I feel that sensation of warmth slowly return to me, though it's not the power of her Essence, and as the minutes pass, waiting for her to turn her eyes to mine and explain the past week, I find my fingers working through her hair.",
            "She snorts, halfway between a laugh and a sob. \"What are you doing, Cody?\"",
            "\"I thought you were training to be a knight, not a dryad,\" I say, gingerly tugging at a small branch snared between several strands of her golden hair.",
            "She looks up at me with her amber eyes, reddened with tears, and I feel the cool air convect the places her sorrow saturated my shirt. I shiver, and realize I've been shivering this whole time, still paying for the consequences of my seditious sit-in against the will to live.",
            "\"Your hands are so cold,\" Katiya says. She leans back against the couch with a sniffle, taking my hand between hers, and is startled at how deathly pale my extremities are. \"Khiras above, Cody, what happened?\"",
            "\"I lost,\" I say. \"And I almost lost it all.\"",
            "\"Lost what?\" she asks, and I feel her radiant warmth spread across my pallid flesh with pins-and-needles.",
            "\"Lost my job. The respect of my father. And the will to live,\" I say, beginning to sob like Katiya as I struggle to mutter the last syllable. \"I think I tried to kill myself.\"",
            "She pauses, then pulls me closer. I expect her to ask where, and how, and why, but she just stays there, sitting in the same space of emotion that I do, refusing to leave when it's just the two of us leaning together, trading just enough heat to ward off the chill.",
            "\"I think I did, too,\" she says. ",
            "\"What happened?\"",
            "\"I'm being released from the program.\"",
            "\"From being a Knight? But why?\" I ask. \"You do scouting every day now.\"",
            "\"It wasn't because of a mission I was assigned,\" she says. \"It was because of a mission I chose.\"",
            "\"What mission?\"",
            "\"I tried to save someone dear to me.\" She forms her mouth in the shape of a name, but hesitates to speak it, as if she doesn't deserve it. \"I just got back from the funeral in my hometown. He was buried in the same place I killed him, and I just walked, and walked, until I begged the ground to swallow me the same way it made him disappear.\"",
            "\"I'm sorry,\" I say.",
            "She pauses as if to let me explain myself, but my suffering has nothing to do with death. It's just genetic weakness.",
            "She then asks, \"and what happened to you?\"",
            "\"It's pathetic,\" I preface. ",
            "\"It's not pathetic if it makes you suffer,\" she says.",
            "\"I tried to solve a temporary problem with a permanent solution,\" I say. \"I'm just so tired of being tired. I was only ever made to subsist, to never enjoy anything. And it just makes me jealous sometimes, you know. Of the ones that never lost that spark.\"",

I had to reason with myself over why to go on, and it was a logical battle, and all I came to is, is that the only way to live is to show up.\" He thinks further, assembling words like screws. \"The only way to succeed in being alive is just deciding to participate. For the next five seconds. Or the next five minutes. Or days, or getting out of bed, or deciding to go to the gym. Or taking a shot in the dark with some old dusty project, thinking it will get you closer to a dream.\"",

But I think it's something we should work towards, after we sort these things out.",
            "I start to try to accept the past has happened. The future hasn't arrived. So I find a different way to channel those feelings.",

            "\"The emptiness never leaves,\" he says. \"It just becomes less, I think, like a smaller part of the whole. Like when I had the project in school, when I was so busy and I never had the chance to be alone.\"",
            "\"Well, then what 'more' is going to make that 'less'?\" I ask.",
            "\"More adventures,\" he says. \"When I moved back here, on that drive home from California with my degree, I imagined all the stuff I'd do with grown-up money, like day trips going to the mountains or the city. Moe. Slice-of-life kind of stuff, like those TV shows I showed you where nothing really changes, but every episode is different.\"",
            "\"Episodic,\" I say, remembering that derivative word.",

            "\"Sure,\" Cody says, and he yawns, withdrawing the phone from his pocket. His thumb swipes between pages of the square programs, settling on the messaging app, and after brief hesitation, he presses SEND on an unsent text. \"I think that world would be worth it.\"",

            "My own snore awakes me though Katiya is still fast asleep. I check my smartwatch: no texts show in the feed yet, but the digitally-analog hands read 3:40.",
            "She leans against my shoulder, drooling on my shirt, her hair still disheveled with grass and leaves between the strands, and after I gently lower her to the thin cushions of the IKEA couch — wrapping her in a tasseled throw blanket called VINTERFINT — there's an unsettling energy that rises in my nerves.",
            "I feel the urge to either run home, or grab Katiya's greatsword instead of my lacrosse stick, and though I'm so much weaker than anyone else in this world, I feel the urge to protect her.",
            "I think I catch a glance of crimson eyes peering through the window glass, as if searching for something within me, but the figure quickly moves from sight. The back window was repaired a couple days ago after a whole cat-man was thrown through it, and when I check it, I think I see a different figure watching me.",
            "I stare longingly at the door, wanting so badly to run and hide, but there's a stronger desire that keeps me there.",
            "\"Katiya,\" I begin to say, quietly, and then louder, as I walk away from safety in my modern world. I don't notice the unlocked back window sliding open so slowly as a guy gestures signals with his other hand: nor do I notice the front door was picked by the same man several minutes earlier, hiding a different stranger at the threshold.",
            "She stirs awake as I stand halfway between Katiya and my escape, tensioned between two emotional anchors that threaten to split me apart. And before I can react, I feel an incredible energy flood my body from somewhere nearby, stiffening every muscle in my body as I struggle to fight the immense power.",
            "A dark-haired man with piercing, black eyes intercepts me as a girl enters the front door with her hand extended. The man looks younger than I do, but holds such gallantry behind his expression that I'm convinced he's lived a thousand lifetimes. ",
            "The girl's eyes glow with crimson light, matching the tips of her dark bangs. My heart seizes in my chest and stops beating, feeling like the plasma in my blood evaporates inside my body. I try to call to Katiya, but words are no longer privileged to me — and when I'm locked out of the use of every muscle, I collapse to the floor as the man pins me by the shoulders.",
            "I can feel the collision in my bones, but not even my nerves will communicate. They won't even tell me the flesh of my right arm contacted the sharp end of Katiya's greatsword, leaving a gash that even hesitates to bleed. ",
            "it feels as if that magical power surges for a moment within my own body — without the circuits in my biology to to reabsorb it — and given  the experience of Essence for the first time, I'm struck with a sudden horror at the incredible energy that emanates from the two strangers.",
            "The girl rushes over to Katiya, and since my stiff body is posed with my head cocked toward the couch, I fear whatever retribution they seek in hurting her.",
            "But she says her name.",
            "\"Katiya,\" the girl says, as she finally rises from the couch. \"Did you leave your door unlocked? There was a stranger without human Essence!\"",
            "\"The back window was unlocked,\" the man says, still pinning me to the floor. \"I think this Chymaeran got in through there.\" But he looks me over further, sensing the energy from the other assailant's attack as it flushes from my body. \"Or any Essence for that matter. How is that possible?\"",
            "Katiya springs to her feet, rushing over to the two of us. \"Dear Khiras above . . . Cody,\" she mutters, still delirious from such an awakening.",
            "Katiya panics while the others remain perfectly calm.",
            "\"You know this man?\" the girl asks. \"Then where did he come from?\"",
            "\"Like I said, he's not Essenced,\" the guy says, looking over the slice with his piercing eyes. \"And not like the outwallers in Blackwater, Sylvia. He has nothing at all.\"",
            "Sylvia states the facts without hesitation when she approaches me. \"Deep laceration, six inches. Muscle layer exposed. No arterial spray, but his pressure's dropping.\"",
            "\"What?\" I manage.",
            "\"I don't have that kind of — healing,\" Katiya says. \"We need medical. But in his world, Gods above, we need to call—\"",
            "Sylvia touches Katiya's shoulder. \"He's going to be fine,\" she says, then turns to me. \"I'm re-aligning the tissue, Cody. Titus here is holding you in place. Don't fight it. You'll feel heat, then pulling, then nothing. Keep breathing.\"",
            "I gasp for breaths after my heart returns to motion. I feel the scalding again — as if the tendrils of some energy spread across the cells of my body. From inside my flesh, the channel of energy ignites when the first tendril reaches the deep cut, aligning all the other stray, searching strands, and I feel the sensation of a heat my nerves can't fully register — like in welding class, when I didn't know I had a hole in my glove.",
            "But it's not just the deep slice. I feel the energy connect in places I couldn't register, because they were spread across a lifetime of small accidents and dangerous choices, and when I lift myself from the floor, feeling more energized than if I slept for a whole weekend. I can't find a trace of the deep cut, or any other scar, for that matter: the four marks from the endoscopic surgery for pyloric stenosis; the graze on my wrist I took from Jackson's BB gun when we were playing war in a forest; the scrape on my leg I got ten years ago at Daniels Park when I smoked with Miguel.",
            "I'd feel the best I ever had in my life if the weight of what's coming wasn't still so heavy. The two strangers lift me to my feet with a thousand apologies.",
            "I turn to Katiya. \"Are you subletting now? Or is this house a hotel?\" I catch my breath though I don't need it: I can breathe through both nostrils for the first time in ages, and hell, I think even my vision is a little better. \"Where do you find these people?\"",
            "\"I'm sorry,\" Titus says, \"really. But you have to understand how close the dangers are now to this town. Miss Katiya agreed to take us in, and our instinct was to protect her.\"",
            "I can't be that angry when I'm almost sure I can push back the physical with my doctor for another year. I didn't even have a moment to feel the pain before my layers of flesh were annealed.",
            "\"It's fine,\" I manage.",
            "The man scratches his beard, looking around the foyer as if he's scanning for every tactical exit. Then he extends his hand. \"My name is Titus Berguard. And this is Sylvia. We're refugees from Blackwater to the north.\"",
            "I shake his hand. It seems to be a common custom between our worlds. And I turn to Sylvia, a girl that stands as tall as I do. \"And Sylvia. Just Sylvia?\"",
            "\"Just Sylvia,\" she repeats. \"And I'm sorry, but are you human?\"",
            "\"Yeah. But not by your definition. I don't have Essence,\" I start, and I look to Katiya to judge whether we're really roping in another couple strangers to our situation. \"No Essence in my world.\"",
            "I gesture to the door. The two stare at all the unfamiliar shapes on the other side, just like Katiya did all those months ago, but somehow, the strangeness doesn't even phase them.",
            "It's something else that interests them.",
            "\"It's an Essence Event that made this door,\" Just Sylvia says.",
            "\"An Essence Event?\" Katiya says. But isn't that only possible to create by a Mask of the Gods? How could you even know in the first place, if you weren't—",
            "Her words cut off, as if afraid to speak. Titus adjusts the sleeve of his coat, covering the threaded scars or tattoos I noticed when I shook his hand.",
            "\"It's a long story that's too fresh to remember,\" Titus says. \"We're just passing through, but rest assured: we'll protect you as long as we're here.\"",
            "I think we've found a breath as Titus adjusts his jacket, but then the three of their heads turn to the front door, sensing something that I can't.",
            "\"Ellie,\" Titus mutters.",
            " He looks up the stairs, and his expression glazes over. He suddenly looks like he's ready to die for something, until Sylvia approaches to reassure him.",
            "Katiya approaches the door without caution after five patterned knocks.",

She wears the expensive, branded workout clothes my gym sells in the pro shop. Beneath the sports bra, the definition in her core is carved in distinctive lines across her abs: the only other lines in the light, silhouetted scars from whatever her \"real\" training forced from her.",
            "She lifts the bar off the rack before I can even get into position. Two other gym rats from another bench leap to the sides in fear, ready to squat a-hundred-and-eighty pounds per side in an instant of things go south, but they're astonished when the bar holds steady at full height.",
            "\"So what progress have you made on your side?\" Katiya asks. \"That drone — is it ready to go, more or less, or are you adding more?\"",
            "\"Well, it's from five years ago when...\" I watch the bar rise and fall as my hands rest lazily on the top. \"When my project happened, but tech in my world...\" she approaches eight, and I wonder if she plans to stop. \"It's exponential growth, so stuff gets old fast, and—you only have to do ten, we have two more sets!\"",
            "She places the bar on the rack. A light sweat crests her forehead. \"So that's all?\"",
            "\"For the first set,\" I say.",
            "\"No, like that's all you have to do for the project?\"",
            "\"I have to present it, too. I already applied to an aerospace opening for entry-level work. But this presentation is what gives me a shot with an early interview, so to speak, and it has to be perfect.\"",
            "We're lucky no one pulled their phones out to take a video. She gestures to the bench now, as if I could lift the same anoint of weight.",
            "\"No,\" I say.",
            "\"I'll cover you.\" Katiya says.",
            "\"It's 'spot.' And no.\"",
            "\"What, you want three instead?\" She asks, flashing a grin. \"Upstaged by a girl?\"",
            "\"I do one of those and a twenty-five to start,\" I say, but my ego's hurt enough with all the attention. \"Just . . . make it two, and make it look like I'm able to kinda do it, alright?\"",
            "\"Sure,\" she says, and I slide beneath the bar at my one-rep max. ",
            "\"You sure you got it?\" I ask.",
            "\"Well, I told Rayna I'd meet her contact,\" she says.",
            "\"No. The bar,\" I say. \"From that angle.\"",
            "She lifts it up with two hands in response. With so little ego left, I lift the bar off and immediately struggle.",
            "\"But you were right. I don't know: I just started thinking in that moment of everything I wanted on the other side of all of this. So long I spent thinking of the obstacles in front of me without the hope of what's on the other side.\"",
            "I manage one, and already feel exasperated, unable to get the bar on both sides of the bracket, and feel it slowly sink down..",
            "\"But you have that dream too, Cody. And there's something for the both of us,\" she says. \"Maybe we can talk about how we, uh . . . feel, and all, when this is over.\"",
            "\"Can't,\" I sputter.",
            "\"But you can,\" she says. \"We can.\"",
            "The bar flexes my sternum, testing the resilience of my cartilage more than the might left in my muscles. It takes a few seconds before Katiya returns from her dream, curling a hand under the middle of the bar and lifting it.",
            "I cough. \"I gotta . . . live long enough to try.\"",
            "\"You will. And you're not done,\" Katiya says, refusing to let me rack the bar, though she still takes some of the weight off with her strength. The muscles in her arms tense. \"You've got nine left.\"",
            "\"Nine?\" I ask: most of the time Miguel and I only lift to have an excuse to talk. My arms tremble. She makes every rep burn, but I feel a long-forgotten sense of wholeness in just the strain of exertion itself.",
            "I could never lift this much alone, and I was stupid to ever think I could. And once I'm done, after I catch my breath, before reminding Katiya we have other exercises to burn ourselves out, I sincerely ask her.",
            "\"We can talk about the details later,\" she says.",
            "\"Then how about we make this into . . . a date?\" I ask."

            "\"What is this?\" I ask.",
            "\"You look like a white girl, but you're sure-as-hell the opposite. So order on here. Pick one that looks good: what kind of flavor do you like?\"",
            "\"Flavor?\" I think of what's at the guardpost: the only control we have over the taste is how far we dilute it with water, and I just drink it straight from the pot.",
            "\"How about Pumpkin Spice? It's nearly out-of-season.\"",
            "\"I want black, please,\" I tell him.",

            "\"Just black. None of the other stuff.\"",

            "\"I want it straight,\" I tell him.",

            "\"Sometimes it's better that way,\" Cody says. \"As long as they don't rip you off by filling a full cup of ice.\" He scrolls between options on his phone, choosing for me. \"I'll give you a little bit of room so you can add something. Suffering seems to be your M.O., but it's okay to enjoy your life every once in a while, you know?\"",
            "I try to glare at him, but he's too busy choosing his own drink. He gestures to an empty table facing the window, and when we sit, I can feel the air drop a few degrees from the light dusting of snow outside the window.",
            "He sits across from me, turning his phone upside-down and placing it on the table. We both watch as civilians pass on the sidewalk, and behind them, the steel shell of Cody's car struggles to melt off the snow with the leftover heat from the engine.",
            "\"I thought it would be different,\" I say.",
            "\"What's that?\"",
            "\"The way people walk when they're between two places. Work and home, or home and work, or doing some short-list of chores between the two. It's the same as my world. They have the same expression. Same gait, same anxiety.\"",
            "\"I'd think they'd be more anxious in your world,\" Cody says.",

            "He hunches over to rest his head in his hands. \"Sometimes I think that nothing could be going on at all, and people would feel that discomfort all the same. When less happens, you think more. And when more happens, you think less — but the strain of all that catches up.\"",
            "\"But shouldn't less give you more time to be lazy?\" I ask.",
            "\"It makes you feel guilty, like you should always be doing something. I finished college, and I still dream of facing exams and tests I haven't studied for.\"",
            "\"But it's just an adjustment, though, isn't it? Most Royal Guards that retire have a hard time finding peace after they turn in the crest, but they eventually get there.\"",
            "\"Maybe for one person, but what about a whole people?\" Cody asks. \"My world made it to the point that one press of a button could destroy a whole continent, so we don't press the limits much anymore. And if we are fighting, we're controlling machines a thousand miles away.\"",
            "\"Then why is there all this anger?\" I ask, gesturing to my phone. \"Feels like I'm watching my own world, a hundred years from now. You're all humans, the SAME race, yet people always seem to be yelling at each other. If you've solved war by taking it as far as it can go, then where is the peace?\"",
            "\"Peace isn't profitable,\" Cody says. \"And it's not that comfortable either. If life is still hard, and prices are still high, and you don't have something that everybody can agree is worth fighting, I think people start to turn on each other.\"",
            "\"So hardship is the default,\" I say.",

            "\"I guess,\" he says.",
            "Cody gets up from the table, and moments later, he returns with two drastically-different drinks. One is blacker than Chymaeran tar in a clear glass with cubes of ice floating around. The other is light brown and cloudy, with foam and a sugary drizzle on the top.",
            "He sets the drinks at exactly halfway across the table, refusing to push one further towards me than the other.",
            "\"So I got the dark one,\" I say.",
            "\"Yeah,\" Cody says. He watches me hesitate, and a mischievous smile splits across his face. \"You got the dark one. And you're right we can't get 'distracted by sweets:' I guess I just broke the rule, right?\"",
            "\"Well,\" I say, feeling my cold stoicism slowly thaw with the warmth of my desire. \"Well . . . I'm going to try this one,\" I say, snatching the sugary one.",
            "He frowns. \"But you ordered this one!\"",
            "\"Well, you left yourself that 'room,' didn't you?\" I ask, taking a loud slurp through the straw, tasting something so sweet and rapturous that it's hard to contain my bliss.",
            "He grumbles before he takes a sip. \"Like fuckin' dirt,\" he says. \"And you drink this? Are they trying to prepare you to die by taking all the smallest joys from you?\"",
            "I'm too busy sucking down the flavors. He grumbles again, then pours in two sugar packets, then takes a sip that twists his face again, and then pours in some milk.",
            "Once he's satisfied, he takes a long sip, punctuated by a few words.",

We got Sylvia something cherry-flavored since she seems to really like the color red, and Rayna has the same drink Katiya stole from me.",

And Katiya meets with Rayna's contact tomorrow, where she'll get more information. And the through line is this.\" I tap my toe against the only other perfect shape in the room beyond the Starbucks cups: a Pelican case, holding the prototype for my drone I shelved almost half a decade ago.",

That means it might be the perfect place to test some technology that might give us an advantage.\" I lift the non-magic battery. \"I'll test on this battery to get some data for the interview. But this one,\" I lift the Essenced one, \"will run the drone when it's in operation on your side.\"",

            "\"It lets you see through it, like you're looking through the eyes of the bird. But you control it, and you can see what it's looking at from a long ways away. You'll have to set me up somewhere in your world, but for whatever's coming, you'll have all the information you need.\"",

            "Kei pushes Miguel out of the doorway, unwrapping her scarf as Reed carries in both of their backpacks. Miguel shifts to the black faux-leather futon, and while Kei debates whether to remove her pink, woven beanie, Reed shakes Cody's hand, exchanging pleasantries over some inside joke.",
            "\"Surprised to see you here,\" Kei tells me. \"Are you here to help, or to drink?\"",
            "\"Neither for now,\" I say, as I lean back through the portal to find Titus and Sylvia looking over Gaffesend's map, circling a few points of interest in red ink. \"I've got my own project I'm working on.\"",
            "\"Cool,\" Reed says. \"Is it the cosplay thing?\"",
            "Maybe a few months later I'd flatly reject the question. They were fighting words the first time I met Cody, but instead, I just shrug. \"Yeah, something like that.\"",
            "\"Well, good luck,\" Reed says.",
            "\"Thanks.\"",
            "Miguel snaps open the big case as Kei demands he \"handle it carefully.\" Rayna crosses back to see what Titus and Sylvia are looking at. And as Reed bends a knee to get a first look at the project, Cody approaches me.",
            "\"So you're good?\" He asks.",
            "\"As good as I can be,\" I say. \"If it's not, I know you're close by.\"",
            "He puts up his fists and takes a couple practice swings, getting several things wrong in the span of a couple seconds. \"My track record isn't great over there, but I swear — I'll die for you.\"",
            "\"Save your breath,\" I say, retreating through the door though we still face each other, separated only by the miasmic veil between worlds. I look up at his lips. He looks down at mine, and though I think for just a second that something might happen, something crashes, and Miguel calls him over.",
            "Cody laughs. I feel his warm breath while his face is inches from mine.",
            "\"Goddamnit, Miguel!\" Kei says. \"What did I tell you?\"",
            "\"It's not my fault it was loose,\" he whines. \"Where do you even find screws this small?\"",
            "He turns to me one last time as he grasps the edge of his door. \"Save your world and shit, yeah?\"",
            "\"Yeah,\" I say.",
            "\"I . . . look forward to that tomorrow. Let's see how much we can get done today.\"",
            "\"Of course,\" I say.",
            "He lingers one more second, hesitates, then softly closes the door behind him. I lock my side, then turn to join my small militia of outcasts.",
            "We spend an hour reviewing every detail of the map with the foreigners. The two moons hang just above the horizon across the lake, providing just enough light to see the map with the curtains drawn.",
            "\"It's still just so hard to believe,\" Titus says, looking down at his grandfather's hand-drawn map of Blackwater, trying to hold it northwards at the right distance from Gaffesend. ",
            "\"We were taught that the world was ice,\" Sylvia adds. \"That all of Fosroth was frozen after the fall of Northaven!\"",
            "\"So what made you go south?\" I ask. \"Was it just a lucky guess?\"",
            "\"It's where the tracks run,\" Titus says.",
            "\"With the all produce,\" Rayna says. \"And where does that all come from?\"",
            "Titus' gaze becomes distant. He looks down at his wrist with all the threaded scars. I think Sylvia might turn to console him, but she seems just as lost as her partner.",
            "\"It's no longer there,\" Titus says. \"But I have to believe that what I . . . that what happened was for the better.\"",
            "\"It was,\" Sylvia says. \"They're free to step into the light now, just like we are.\"",
            "\"Yeah,\" he mutters. His eyes soften after they return from infinity. \"So anyways. We don't have the information we need yet, but at least I have a better idea of Gaffesend's defenses.\"",
            "I feel the presence of something watching us from behind the front windows. Something shifts, but this time, the stranger's smart enough to use their voice.",
            "\"Katiya,\" Aryn calls, as Rayna hastily leaps behind the couch. Aryn's fist pounds against the door, as several other junior guards stand behind her."

The mates are all broken, meaning the computer model is cobbled together with programmatical duct tape: it was from before I spent three odd years honing my mastery of the process.",
            "The swish and flick of the mouse is a feeling I miss as I navigate the model on my TV screen. We decided today was just a disassembly day, and as my three friends take apart every piece to carefully explode it across the floor, I manually explode every piece of the model.",
            "Miguel bites into his third slice of pepperoni pizza, then reclines across the couch to scroll through something on his phone — Kei joins him for a break, recounting some our shared memories from high school. My stomach rumbles, but it's a feeling I've become used to. The fear I get from stretching that last salaried paycheck is more than enough to chew on, and gum is a lot cheaper than food. The first slice I grab from the box is the first thing I've eaten today, and today is thirty minutes from over.",
            "Reed approaches when the two are distracted, setting down the front half of the carbon fiber casing. \"Just so you know, I've made it official,\" he says.",
            "I'm surprised when I find there's no jealousy there: I'm just genuinely happy for them. \"That's great, man. When did you ask?\"",
            "\"I emailed last week.\"",
            "\"Emailed?\" What the fuck? \"You emailed her?\" I look over at Kei. \"What about in-person?\"",
            "\"It was a dude,\" Reed says, and now I'm even more confused. \"Met him through my dad, works for the Aerospace division.\"",
            "I know Reed's good at climbing corporate ladders, but I never saw him taking it this far. I remain quiet, hoping for him to say anything else.",
            "And he does. \"I asked my dad to introduce us. I talked about your project, and the brown bag event, and get this: he said he saw your resume in the pool for positions. Seems to imply they'll treat your presentation as a pre— what? Why are you laughing?\"",
            "Kei and Miguel look across the room at the two of us. It's hard to stop once I start. \"You,\" I say, \"you said you made it official, Reed, do you know what that means?\"",
            "He stares, blankly. \"Yeah. It's official now. Unlike when we were at Chili's.\"",

            "\"Yeah?\"",
            "\"Yeah. Downtown's her favorite place,\" I say. ",

            "Miguel lifts the battery chassis into the air, the last accessible part. \"So I think it's done,\" he says. \"You were right. All that oxidation in California rusted the shit out of some of these bolts. And...\"",
            "Kei's expression twists. \"Miguel! What did you—\"",
            "\"It was like this. I swear,\" he says. The days of the project were so long and stressful that my mind tried to forget, but when I see the long fracture severing both halves of the aluminum chassis, I remember instantly.",
            "\"He's right. I forgot,\" I say.",
            "\"Forgot what?\"",
            "\"Forgot I crashed the damn thing,\" I say. \"Not hard, but it happened sometime after the project was presented. Never thought I'd be presenting it again, so I didn't bother, and it was hidden beneath all this time.\"",
            "We glare at the uneven face as Miguel still holds it in the air: the only one that's jagged, beyond my piss-poor machining skills leaving all the faces a little chattered.",
            "\"So what should we do, then?\" Kei asks. \"We can't 3D print it.\"",
            "\"What about the work machine shop?\" Reed asks.",
            "\"I doubt they'll let me in,\" I say. \"Haven't had the training yet.\"",
            "Miguel shrugs. \"I mean, my uncle has a lot of scrap metal. You could probably find something this size. And you're like family to them, so they'll give you whatever you need if you tell them why.\"",
            "\"That's great,\" I say. \"But I'll still need to make another, and I need access to a machine shop.\"",
            "Kei turns to Reed. \"What about the empty four-car garage?\"",
            "\"The . . . oh, yeah,\" he says. \"My dad's hobby is working on cars. He has half a machine shop kitted out. They're all manual mills, though.\"",
            "\"Steel and metal?\" I ask.",
            "\"Yeah, and wood,\" Reed says. \"You're welcome to stop by. My parents have been looking forward to meeting you.\"",
            "My stomach turns a little at meeting another executive. \"Sure. That would be great.\"",
            "\"And what about the rest of these bolts?\" Miguel asks, holding a fistful of rusty set screws that look like clogs of dirt. \"And the holes?\"",
            "\"I'll re-tap them,\" I say. \"Or helicoil.\"",
            "\"And the software?\" Kei asks.",
            "\"It worked last time,\" I say. \"Should work enough for a demonstration.\"",
            "\"Then I think we have enough figured out to get started,\" Reed says.",
            "\"Come over to my uncle's shop tomorrow for some scrap,\" Miguel says, as I scroll to my original print for the part. \"I'm sure you'll find something.\"",
            "\"And stop by once you've got enough to machine,\" Reed says. \"I'll drop a pin.\"",
            "\"And . . . I'm not sure how I can help yet,\" Kei starts, \"but I will.\" The two engineers shoulder their bags. Miguel grab his box of beers to let them roll around in his car some more.",
            "\"You've done enough,\" I tell her, then address the rest of them, saying, \"you've all done enough. Your charity's the only way I can pull this off: you know how much the materials cost? I'm lucky the college covered it for publicity,\" I say. ",
            "\"We promise we'll get you there,\" Reed reassures me: the last to lean in the doorway before they all leave. \"But once you get in that room, it's all on you.\""

She used to live in this house, you know, and all that time she spent alone, I wasn't there for a second of what she went through.\" I feel her push against the door a little harder, maybe hoping to come in and revisit the ghost. \"But in your absence — not seeing you for a whole week since we buried him, I hate how much that makes me wonder, that makes me regret not being there.\"",

            "\"But you're here right now, and you won't even open the door to look at me,\" she says, holding an unfamiliar inflection in her voice that gives me chills. \"You're not at fault either, can't you see that?\"",
            "\"I know, but—\"",
            "\"But you've been holed up in this house for days! I know you're embarrassed: maybe you're indecent, or you haven't bathed in a while, but I just want to see you,\" she says.",
            "I stuff my body into the eyeline, then crack the door so she can't see anything else. She looks up at me from the porch: probably thinks my hair is disheveled from days of loneliness, but I've just been busy plotting my throes of redemption.",
            "I hear Rayna stand from behind the couch, and it frightens me: I can feel how much she's longed to reconcile. Maybe she just wants a glance of her, to see how much Aryn's changed in her absence — but she's clumsy in her reproach.",
            "I hear the dining table screech against the floor when Rayna bumps it in the dark. She gasps, and when I hear something slender and metallic slide across the surface, she grasps the utensil in her hand before it can crash to the floor.",

            "Aryn glares between Titus and Sylvia: from how her flesh shivers, she reacts to their immense energy that same way that I first did — and though she could surely prod further, she relents. She clenches her fists with the slightest tell of fear, slipping back through the doorway.",
            "\"I'm not sure what I believe,\" Aryn says. \"I don't know what's going on, or what you're got yourself into with these people, Katiya, but please,\" she looks one last time to the door her sister disappeared through— \"just please, tell me when you need my help.\""

Villagers pass every morning along the lake to watch for waves: even though only the shoreline is frozen, the ice inches faster and faster towards the center of the lake each day. Soon they'll be hurling boulders to judge whether our finest barrier is no more than a flat plane of solid ice — the Capital's already sent its first detachment to defend the village from the east, quartered in the eastern barracks.",

Rayna wears the only set of clothes she owns, and Titus and Sylvia don decorated armor from their forgotten life, though they cover it with a dark shawl.",

We walk between soldiers from the Purgatory Line enjoying their window of respite, sampling all the goods they can stomach in the Main Street market — and it would almost feel like tourist season if their faces weren't scraped with the thrashings of war, and their bellies weren't as bottomless as the appetites of the conflict beyond the lake.",
            "We slip through the crowds, ducking arms extended with precious Kine in trade, weaving around clusters of native townies complaining about the crowd, and when we finally make it to the edge of the market, short-cutting through long alleyways, the buildings get shorter, until only a wide, barren field of frost and frozen dirt spans between the town and the old castle: where our informant awaits.",

My fingers brush the foreign fabric of the green scarf, dry and thin like the desert, with sand still stuck between the stitches. Titus and Sylvia begin to flank around the sides as overwatch, leaving just Rayna and I to cross the middle of the field, feeling watched from behind the entire time.",

We approach the entrance through which I once chased her, stopping at the steps as we wait for any sign of interaction from the strangers all around us. One leans against the wall, rambling madly with delusions. Another cooks squirrel meat on a makeshift grill, and a patchy Ahkvasan eats it raw.",
            "\"How will we know?\" I ask Rayna. \"What if this is a trick?\"",
            "\"It's not. This informant and I fought for our lives together: this isn't a ruse.\"",
            "I stare at the floor as I sit on the steps: my hood obscures vision of anything beyond the weathered stone stairs. I can feel the world's quiescence grow the more I wait, my heart beating slower as it feels like the weather is getting hotter. I thought it might be a rogue ray of light, but the sun hasn't parted the thick clouds all day.",
            "\"Hey Rayna — you think they're just late? Were they even expecting us?\" ",
            "I gasp, suddenly feeling breathless from a meager two sentences. Then I try again: this shortness of breath isn't from a feeling. ",
            "It's something else.",
            "\"Rayna?\"",
            "Sitting doesn't help, so I stand, grabbing Rayna's shoulder, but I don't feel warmth. I grab harder, but the fabric refuses to bend. She doesn't even react: still as stone, her face frozen in an expression similar to that of my cherished friend in his last moments, and the sudden panic races my heart.",
            "She's stuck like all the ancient statues of knights that the homeless tether their tarps to, forever bound to a pedestal. Her mouth is left agape, but I realize it's not from emoting a sense of terror.  ",
            "She's trying to respond to me, but she can't get the words out.",
            "Or maybe they just haven't come out yet.",
            "I descend the stairs. The air is hot wherever it rushes against my skin, and when I reach the bottom, I step to crunch the frosted grass beneath my feet.",
            "But it won't move. ",
            "My ankle twists on the fibrous fronds that refuse to give, and I nearly fall before recollecting myself, feeling such a strong sense of heat the more my muscles labor to keep me upright. The air is thin as the lack of pressure pops my ears, and with the taste of ozone in my breath, I finally look up.",
            "The world is still.",
            "I stumble over the uneven plane of grasses, stiff as steel rods, finding Titus and Sylvia in the distance. But they're not watching the steps. Something grabs their attention in the direction of the village, and without any other visual cues, I try to follow their line of sight.",
            "I head back towards Gaffesend, trying to find a sense of motion in anything as the birds are stuck in the sky; the flames of torches unwavering; the first snow of the day kept still like stars during the day. ",
            "But the strangest sight is a lone Royal Guard, still as cardstock as she stands a hundred yards away, right where Titus and Sylvia might have seen her. The fabric of her hood is contoured to the peaks of her ears. Her eyes stare directly at the old castle; her expression tense yet apprehensive; the poise of her pace swift from the way her black tail bends behind her.",
            "But there's nothing I can do to stop her, to stop Aryn's curiosity from getting the better of her. And I don't realize I've been distracted until I begin circling again, stumbling across the uneven landscape, searching for any sign of motion as my flesh begins to sweat — the beads hanging perfectly in the air as they slip from my skin.",
            "It's only after a minute of silent stillness — around when my ears start ringing — that I see the lone, cloaked wanderer adorned with a similar shawl to my scarf approaching from the northern tree line, headed directly for me as I decide whether to run or to stand perfectly still.",
            "But the stranger decides for me. ",
            "They raise their hand, releasing me ever-so-slowly from the binds of time. I watch the positions of every one of my footsteps combust with heat as my backlog of motion cashes out — scorching the grasses — and scalding where I grabbed Rayna's shoulder with a sudden burst of flame. I'm stuck between frames of entropy with nowhere to run, at the mercy of the timeless stranger."

            "Without entitlement to fast or slow, I'm in a halfway home between two states of motion. It feels like these dilations of time don't even encompass my whole body anymore: my body feels slow as molasses while my mind races just as fast as it was before, giving me a headache as I turn to realize how close they've come. ",
            "My senses fail me when the stranger excludes my nerves from this pocket of entropy. My mind pleads for information, and with only my sight in full function, it fils my thoughts with every detail I can grasp.",
            "There are two peaks that crest beneath the worn, hooded robe, but their face isn't smooth like Rayna or Aryn. It's an Ahkvasan like Naya, but their fur is a different color — and a different color that isn't natural. ",
            "But purposely unnatural: their coat is sullied with dirt, yet it doesn't look like some feral Ahkvasan that's weathered the wastelands. The roots of their fur — her fur — are radiant and impossibly golden, shimmering with more light than the world can offer, yet the strands taper off into flat, unnatural clods of brown, of dirt, and by the time this Ahkvasan's emerald eyes meet mine, I notice the missing span of her cloak that she tore to make this scarf.",
            "I'm almost relieved when her hands reach me — to finally feel something touch me back after several minutes in tactile isolation.",
            "\"Don't panic,\" she says, and her voice booms with an air of veneration. My body catches up to my mind, flooded with sensory information that's ourdated, and when she tugs at my cloak, we begin racing towards the north. I can feel her tremble with exhaustion, and I can sense this grand display has costed her a substantial amount of Essence.",
            "She slows time when we approach the tree line to ensure the grass has long enough to bend, so that our footfalls won't combust in mysterious flashes of heat. When we make it to cover, the world recovers, and once again I hear all the sounds of life I took for granted beyond the pounding of my heartbeat in my temples. We catch our breath for several seconds as she rifles through her pockets, careful not to tatter the fabric with her claws. I'm too stunned to speak, so I continue to let her pull me deeper into the woods, approaching the small northern lobe of Gaffesend Lake, though we surely won't be able to cross.",
            "\"I'm sorry to petrify you with time,\" she says, and while I'm figuring out whether she means physically or emotionally, the golden Ahkvasan pulls a spherical, green stone from inside her pockets. \"We need to get somewhere quiet. I understand you brought protection, but beyond Rayna, I can't trust anyone right now.\"",
            "\"This seems pretty remote,\" I say.",
            "\"We have an appointment with another. A couple hundred miles north,\" she says. \"You've been through the bends of time, but there's one more quick voyage we have to undertake.\"",
            "\"Hundred?\" I repeat. \"But how? Are we going to fly?\"",
            "\"We're already there — that is, if she's there,\" the Ahkvasan says. She hands me a second smooth sphere, and I grab it, but it doesn't rotate in my hands. It's light and so easy to lift — like a paperweight, but won't twist no matter how hard I try to turn it. I feel an otherworldly energy spin my circuits, and as I hear the omnipresent words of an ancient tongue.",
            "I don't even feel my body lurch to motion, but it's  like orbiting around the Earth on one of Cody's computer maps that show his entire world, as if the still sphere refuses to move because it's connected to something else I can't see between space. My mind can't reconcile the sight of anything around me, so I focus on the sphere. The jagged marble-like surface scrolls through textures as if it ripples, but it never changes size, feeling like we're being folded and pulled in a direction I've never felt before, and when I look up, I find the world is still again.",
            "There's a third hand touching the sphere that I grasp between my hands. It's green and calloused with veins like leaves: the fingers fibrous, cold, and resilient. The Ahkvasan touches their other hand — which holds another sphere — and when we step back, I discover this cold-blooded figure is a member of a forgotten race: a forgotten race that lives with veins, but no blood.",
            "Her two eyes are darker than night, like those of an insect, but larger than a human's. Crimson vines descend from her head beneath long, colorful leaves, giving her bangs, and her face is contoured with features like those of a grasshopper: a distinct, sharp, scraggly mouth with mandibles on the side.",
            "I feel like I'm going to make sick after being bent through space and time: it's obvious these two hold a terrifying amount of power, far beyond the pale of even the strongest commoner. Most go their whole lives without meeting one of the Masks of the Gods, but I don't doubt for a second that I've met two of them over the course of a single day.",
            "I clutch my stomach as I look around: the air is much colder, and we stand at the front of some natural amphitheater, vacant of any signs of life.",
            "\"Where's this waypoint?\" The Ahkvasan asks.",
            "\"Due west of Blackwater proper,\" the Verdalan replies. \"I prognosticated this position as the egress point of the leyline: traversing that long passage to scour dying rooms in the caverns of space.\"",
            "\"So the signature was here, but it wasn't...here,\" the Ahkvasan says. \"It was on another plane.\"",
            "\"A dying bubble of existence that was abandoned. So many chained together that we barely made it out  before the walls of rotting realities could consume us,\" she says, and then I notice the two humans standing behind her, wearing the same armor that Titus and Sylvia wear. One's bald and dark-skinned like Ryder, and the other one is a short, blonde, Demi-human girl with cat ears, but no tail.",
            "But they both look so much worse for wear. It's weird enough hearing a plant talk with a better vocabulary than I have — and it's probably not even her first language.",
            "\"So you're the contact,\" the Verdalan says, before looking to the Ahkvasan for a nod of approval. She touches one of the trees, and part of her consciousness leaves her for a second. \"We're safe here. Beyond the winter hare, there isn't a soul that trudges these wastes for miles.\"",
            "I look between the two humans' faces: the only familiar sight though they're two strangers. None of us are even on a first-name basis yet.",
            "\"I'm sorry for the cloak-and-dagger,\" the Ahkvasan says. \"I'm from a place where the color of my fur is a namesake that could topple an empire.\"",
            "\"And will,\" the Verdalan says.",
            "\"My name is Jade,\" says the Ahkvasan. \"A Mask of the Gods, and the rightful heir of Melenia.\"",
            "\"And I go by Aliaki. One of the last Verdalan Masks to span the space between Fosroth and its moon. The last messenger of Xi'Nu.\"",
            "\"And I'm Katiya.\" They wait for an epithet. \"I, uh, was a guard for a while. A world-crosser. And I have some refugees from the north at my place that look like those two,\" I say, gesturing to the two humans, but they don't speak, looking exhausted from some recent ordeal.",
            "Aliaki turns to them. \"The anomaly is attached to a dying world, so she can't return in physical form. She'll have to inhabit what this world left behind.\"",
            "The burly human asks, \"and where will we find her?\"",
            "\"She'll come to us,\" Aliaki says. \"When she rises from the depths, she'll come to the last place we met: the leyline that led us home.\"",
            "\"Then we should head south now, Romin,\" the girl tells her partner, tugging gently at his sleeve. \"The rest of our fireteam waits down there: not a chance they've made it further.\"",
            " \"And they have no idea of what's coming,\" he responds."

Those woodsy, rich neighborhoods between Hearthland Ridge and Shaleborough are full of those wealthy types that wanna feel a sense of adventure when they're driving home on an unlit road that snakes up a hill — the same people that drive white G-wagons and never plan to take it off-roading.",
            "But it's the idea of it that's exciting, I guess, and I still have no idea what's behind the third unlit stop sign when I've spent a full day on the floor, cranking a wrench in a sensory-deprivation bath of fluorescent light. My eyes still ache, and my headlights aren't bright enough, and since my braking foot aches from standing all day, I decide to just go for it.",
            "The scrap from Miguel's cousin's uncle's shop rattles in the trunk. They loaded me up so at least I won't be shy on materials. The only shyness I feel is the anticipation of meeting Reed's extended family of Navidson-Monroe royalty — watching the houses get bigger and bigger as I wonder when this hill is ever going to end.",

            "\"I think I'm here — that is, if you're here,\" I say, grasping the smooth, rounded ball of the automatic gearshift, popping it into park. Reed waves in the window, and I pop the parking brake before turning my wheels as far as they go.",
            "I exit the driver's seat into pitch darkness, swigging the last of my second energy drink. I take the scrap under my arm from the trunk. A second wind of energy coarses through my veins as I hear Reed's voice calling to me from the porch.",
            "His parents surprise me when I enter: I look so much worse for wear in my father's old technician clothes, while every member of Reed's family is cleanly-dressed with dirty blonde hair — like a family of overachieving golden retrievers.",
            "\"So you're his best friend,\" his father says, before looking to his son for a nod of approval. He strangles my hand with a business handshake before pulling open the blinds, looking out at the incredible view of Denver from the hilltop. \"We're pretty isolated out here,\" he says. \"Beyond about three neighbors, there isn't a soul out here for miles.\"",
            "I look between Reed's mother and father: the only unfamiliar sight though they seem to know everything about me. He insists Im his best friend, though of us are even on a first-name basis yet.",

And I have some scrap here for the machine shop — but I don't want to get your house dirty,\" I say, gesturing to all the white-and-gold as two of his siblings come upstairs, but they don't speak — nervous at the presence of some dirty stranger.",

My wounds are still fresh from the recent loss — and with a formalized tribunal on the horizon, happening in a mere week and a half, it's only now that I realize how these two avenues intersect.",

A sizable unit sneaks through the north in the abandoned lands, over here,\" she says, drawing a line in emerald ink. The pen dances over the hills manifested by Aliaki's Essence, and after scribbling several notes on meeting points, she rolls up the map and hands it to me.",
            "And then the meeting is over. For beings with the gifts of time and space, it almost feels like they're in a rush. Maybe it's the only chance I have to ask.",
            "\"So what brings together an Ahkvasan and a Verdalan?\" I ask.",
            "\"We're just two agents on an eternal campaign against the two forces of Fosroth. The Eternalists seek to manifest Essence to live forever, withholding souls from reincarnation in the Reservoir of Souls. And the Ephemeralists seek the right to die and live again.\"",
            "\"And which are you?\"",
            "\"We seek to die when the time is right,\" Aliaki says. \"That means even if that right isn't when we think it should be.\"",
            "\"Romin and Valentina will seek you out when they make the trip,\" Jade says, as Aliaki extends her hands with the two perfect spheres.",
            "\"Why don't they travel like this?\" I ask.",
            "\"You ever hear of that boat puzzle, where you can only take so many people across the river each time?\" Jade says. \"You need an initiator on each side to set the point of departure if it's a new location.\"",
            "\"This sphere is a single solid in a higher dimension, each one piercing our world at two points. Fire blind and you'll end up missing — maybe fused somewhere in the heart of the planet.\"",
            "I rest my hands in Aliaki's, grasping the small shape as tight as I can. Just as fish live peacefully knowing nothing of the world beyond the water, I close my eyes softly this time, wishing for nothing more than an ignorance of higher dimensions. And by the time I open my eyes, I've already returned to the shores of Gaffesend alongside Jade, finding two familiar faces rushing to confront us."

            "\"I don't get many friends that come all the way out here,\" Reed says, then mutters, \"not really at all.\"",
            "\"It was a damn journey,\" I say. \"My blood's so full of caffeine, I shouldn't have been driving.\"",
            "It's hard not to pretend to notice the third set of footsteps behind us as Reed doesn't even notice. He says, \"and I'm sorry about my parents: the whole best friend thing, you know.\"",
            "\"It's cool, bro. We've come a long way. I talk to my family about you guys all the time,\" I say, as we turn the corner of another span of double garages, finding cars parked three-in-a-line with different trophies from car shows on the walls. It's the only dirty room of the house, looking like it housed a tractor during their build process. The windows are covered, and when we enter, Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb autoplays over the speakers.",
            "I forget we're being followed when the double garage looks like a museum of beautiful, antiquated machines: an old LeBlond engine lathe from the 1940s, and another mill with a CNC retrofit, overtaking the manual controls with automatic displays that blink red and green. The wall holds a massive tap-and-die chart that even my grandma could read without her glasses: reminding me of the old machine shop back at university.",
            "\"She's been itching for action,\" Geoffrey says, and it startles me. \"Sorry. I wanted to see you boys at work: white-collar management is so zoomed out from the battlefield, that it's nice to see some action from time to time.\"",
            "\"Sure,\" I say.",
            "\"Here's some trivia: you should know since you taught my boy the other day. Do you gear-shift the lathe before or after it's running?\"",
            "\"Give him a second, Dad,\" Reed says. \"At least let him set up first!\"",
            "\"Before,\" I say. \"It's gears.\"",
            "Geoffrey wrings his calloused hands. \"And what about the band saw, then?\"",
            "\"It's belt-fed,\" I reply. \"You can only change speeds when it's in motion.\" I almost destroyed the shop's band saw yesterday — the only reason I remember.",
            "\"Very good,\" Geoffrey says. \"See? I hope you rub off more on Reed here. I had to coax him into being a gearhead...\"",
            "An uncommon expression clouds my friend's face, unable to respond to his father's calloused, nervous chatter at an unfamiliar guest in his home.",
            "\"He's rubbed off plenty on me,\" I say, deciding where to zero the hefty chunk of uneven metal: still branded with PROPERTY OF RUELAS, NO SCRAP.",
            "\"And how's that?\" his father asks, expecting another joke.",
            "\"Taught me how to be on a team,\" I say, and Reed's eyes lighten. I drive down the table of the mill's bed like I'm lowering an old car window, then lubricate the thirsty ways with a little oil. \"I was a lost sheep for a while. He taught me how to make friends, I think. To care a little more. I mean, goddamn, your son's like the fuckin' sun—\"",
            "I cover my mouth when I realize I'm not in the shop anymore: this isn't some temporal enclave of the 1960s, despite all the hardware. Instead, I'm surprised to find that Geoffrey laughs, clapping Reed on the back.",
            "\"He sure is the friendmaker,\" his father says. ",
            "But his expression changes when he realizes the garage is about to be filled with harsh noise. ",
            "\"So I heard you've got a presentation,\" he says.",
            "I almost drop the chunk of aluminum. ",
            "\"Yeah,\" I say.",
            "\"What happened was unfortunate. I only heard about it because of what Reed told me.\"",
            "\"Oh,\" I say.",
            "\"Reed told me about what your colleague found: you've got some good friends if they're working this hard to help you,\" Geoffrey says, but then he gets serious again, like he's giving me an early performance review, or negotiating a new salary. \"Look. I came down here to tell you that the first I heard of any of that was from Reed, so as far as I know, your slate's clean.\"",
            "\"That's a relief,\" I say.",
            "\"But that doesn't mean you're close. I've been told your slot was last, which should help with recency bias — but Cody, you should consider this presentation your first interview.\"",
            "I swallow, tasting coolant in the air. My hands nervously fumble with the hand wheel, feeling how real this has all become in such a short time.",
            "\"Do you have any questions for me?\" He asks.",
            "I clamp the scrap to the table, setting my first datum. I'm ready to make my first pass on this project since college.",
            "\"How much time do I get?\"",
            "\"Fifteen minutes in the Aspen conference room. Give them something to see outside, and maybe you'll have a while longer.\"",
            "\"A working demo,\" I say.",
            "\"Means you can't hide behind transitions in a PowerPoint.\"",
            "I search through a bin of end mills, finding a flat-end one that matches the collet. The cacophony of noise gives me time to think. \"So that means it will have to work the first time,\" I say.",
            "\"That's right.\"",
            "I look down at the shattered piece I've come here to recreate. It's a stress fracture: sheared at forty-five degrees because the weight was too much, and I hope the next one is made of something better.",
            "There's so much I've learned since the last time.",
            "\"I can do that,\" I say, tracing my finger against the malformed face of blistered metal. I grab the collet with my coolant-stained hands, chucking up an end mill with two shrill chirps from the pneumatic vise.",
            "\"If you treat your colleagues like how you've bonded with my son — and you show true passion for your craft — then you'll fit in well.\"",

            "\"Yeah?\"",
            "\"Please stay for dinner,\" he says, \"and I'm not asking: my wife will kill me if Reed's mysterious friend stays an anecdote.\"",

            "I lack the time to explain before my allies turn on each other, and though Jade feels exhausted from bending time to a near stop, she still manages to slow the world enough for the two of us that they can't hear my words.",
            "Sylvia drew her bow with Essenced arrows as soon as we appeared in a flash of light — and when she saw my panicked expression from weathering another long, short trip, she identified Jade as the enemy, refusing to take any chances.",
            "Jade tenses the polished sphere in her claws: she might not be driving its magic, but it looks like she's the one that's now doing the pulling. A low thrum rattles the bowstring when Sylvia's nocked arrow leaves her fingers, flying fast enough to challenge Jade's grasp of time. The flint arrowhead combusts with white-hot Human Essence, and Titus unsheathes his sword, resonating with another loud hum.",
            "\"Aliaki,\" Jade mutters, and I hear someone coming to even the odds. The sphere scrolls rapidly as the anchor point shifts, and as Sylvia's first arrow crosses half the distance between our two parties, Jade reaches to grab it by its end.",
            "The blistering heat doesn't have the time to sear her flesh and fur, but she winces when she turns it back around, hurling it directly for Titus' head. This extra lapse of time already burdens her enough — like holding back the flow of a powerful river — and as the world begins to settle, shuddering with the urge for progress like tired muscles on their last effort, Aliaki arrives in another flash.",
            "I reach desperately for the rogue arrow, but time no longer waits. Titus refuses to flinch though a white death stares him in the forehead, and in an instant, the flint head erupts into tiny flecks of molten rock.",
            "The shaft combusts into soot, decorating Titus' face with a flash of dark powder. He thinks he has the space to charge an attack as Jade fails to negotiate any more with time, raising his sword to charge, but Aliaki clenches her fist faster.",
            "The pale light in front of us shifts blue. Twenty yards crunches into twenty inches, and before Titus can realize he's been shorted on his approach, Aliaki withdraws a plug from the large waterskin on her back, drenching her fibrous flesh. It goes dry in an instant, and she grows from a meager five feet to more than seven.",
            "Titus tries to shift his weight with fewer steps to gain momentum. I throw myself between the two of them to try to get them to stop, but I've been shorted for just as much space.",
            "Aliaki materializes a spear she's kept in some space between spaces, and lunges at the fearless human, about to make contact with his heart before I nudge the weapon just in time. It pierces through his armpit, but Sylvia can't see his face to know he's fine: that the spear is nothing more than a graze, and when she shouts his name, she invokes a strength from somewhere within that feels more powerful than any of us.",
            "Her hair glows white with the light of a thousand suns: one trapped in each strand of hair, and we feel our bodies overcome with something ethereal that casts us to our knees. It's only when my hands touch both of their chests — a conduit of peace between Aliaki and Titus — that their adrenaline quiesces, and Titus drops the spear from between his arm, along with his blade that Aliaki condensed to a tenth of its length.",
            "\"Give reality a rest,\" I say, \"you're going to break it!\"",
            "\"These are surely not your friends,\" Aliaki says. \"Refugees, they said? They're lying!\"",
            "\"And who the Res are you?\" Titus asks: the two push against my hands, and I feel like an insect stopping two mountains of Essence from colliding, but they don't push hard. Jade catches her breath as she sits on the ground: sweat cleansing her golden coat of all the dirt, and it shimmers in the pale light.",
            "\"I recognize him now. It was him,\" Aliaki says. \"In the frames of every forgotten world: I saw his lifeless husks in all the realities he left behind.\"",
            "\"So he's the anomaly,\" Jade says.",
            "\"No. He's something different. And he sacrificed his gift to shed no more.\"",
            "\"I've come to peace now,\" Titus says, as Sylvia takes his arm. \"I'm an outcast for what I've done, but if you witnessed even a moment . . . of all those ends, can you understand what it was all for?\"",
            "She pauses, drawing a breath of our exhale. \"It must have been madness. But you completed your mission.\"",
            "\"A circular path only ends when you decide to stop,\" Titus says. \"I left the circle.\"",
            "\"And it brought you here.\" Aliaki turns to me. \"Fate brings us to the same mooring point: to her, no more than a common soldier, and yet the linchpin of three Masks of the gods.\"",
            "\"So you know about Sylvia,\" Titus says.",
            "Jade's eyes narrow, exposing thin green slits. \"But she's one of the Chosen, Ali — right? Isn't it four?\"",
            "\"Her class hasn't been in this world since the Second Awakening. She's the incarnation of something far, far older: maybe she doesn't even know it.\"",
            "\"I have an idea,\" Sylvia says.",
            "\"Then it seems that fate points us all in the same direction,\" Jade says. She lifts herself from the ground after taking Gaffesend's dirt in her clutches, muting the shimmer in her strands. \"I came to tell Katiya of an ambush from the west, but what I didn't tell her . . . is that it was futile.\" ",
            "I squint. \"What do you mean by that?\"",
            "\"That I was relaying a message, so your people had a chance to save themselves. Aliaki found a source of tremendous Chymaeran energy in the northern wastes of Blackwater, and she thought that if she could save them — and bring them into the light — that this Mask might be able to delay the incursion.\"",
            "\"What mask?\" Titus asks. \"There were only two. And now I'm the only one.\"",
            "Aliaki says, \"They should be headed here now, shepherded by two other Blackwater refugees. That is, if she's survived the transmutation: her soul will be split.\"",
            "\"Well, is it now the whole truth?\" I ask. \"Is there anything else important that you're hiding?\"",
            "\"I'm sorry,\" Jade says. \"Aliaki and I are in the service of a greater mission than Gaffesend: to reclaim a stolen empire, and this was meant to be a warning. We were headed to Northaven—\"",
            "\"These are a people,\" Titus says. \"You're privileged to a truth, and that truth binds you to a responsibility.\" He grabs his wrist with all the threaded scars. \"That makes you their hope, even if you don't ask for it.\"",
            "\"And that hope has changed with new information.\" Jade looks between the four of us. \"They can't predict what even I was unaware of, so it means we have a real shot,\" then she looks at me. \"And you're the one that fate decides will bring this all together.\""

            "I return home full and exhausted with a clean, new replacement part. They sent me home with expensive glass Tupperware containers that \"you can send home with Reed,\" packed with cuts of tri-tip Geoffrey seared and grilled.It has a whole two shelves of space to breathe in my fridge, besides a Costco trip from mom, Katiya's Chinese leftovers, and a rack of Pabst Blue Ribbon that gives me a taste of college.My muscles ache from the chatter of the machines. Micro-abrasions on my fingers sting with hand sanitizer, and I'm about to head up to take a shower when I hear the sound of crying next door. So instead I grab the leftovers, inching my way through Katiya's door with a container, slow enough to not invoke the wrath of another stranger. I think it's Rayna at first glance, sitting on Katiya's couch in her foyer, but then there's a copy of her. They both look like Rayna. The double doesn't cry: she just stares at her reflection with piercing blue eyes. I knock on the door lightly, yet the two catgirls jump.\"Intruder!\" One of them says.\"Cody,\" Rayna says. The name brings the other to lower her weapon. \"What's happening this time? Did you duplicate yourself?\"\"This is Aryn,\" Rayna says, \"my sister.\"\"Who are you?\" Aryn asks, but she squints harder. \"Wait, I remember you — you were outside this house. The noble. That Royal Inventor that got the slice on the hand.\"\"That's me,\" I say, while Rayna sniffles. \"I heard crying next door. What's going on?\"\"An unexpected reunion. A dead girl walked into my town, and I found out that she's my sister.\" She turns back to Rayna, raising her voice again. \"Was Katiya hiding you here the whole time? Is that why she was so secretive?\"\"I'm only here because I forced myself upon her goodwill,\" Rayna says. \"She has nothing to do with this.\"\"I thought she was mourning!\" Aryn slams the coffee table, and her sister jumps.\"She still is,\" Rayna says.\"I trusted her, and she used that trust to hide everything,\" Aryn says. \"You should have come to me. Or at least — why didn't you go home? Mom and Dad could have protected you. They would give anything.\"Rayna sniffles, lowering her head even further. \"So why, Rayna? Tell me,\" Aryn says, flashing the contours of her fangs. \"Now!\"\"Take it easy,\" I say. She glares hard enough to drive me back a couple steps, then tries to soften her voice, but the anger still abrades the words in her throat. \"Just tell me,\" Aryn says. \"Please—\"\"I couldn't bear it,\" Rayna says.\"Bear what?\" Aryn says.\"I couldn't bear to face you,\" Rayna says. \"But we swore to protect each other, no matter what, and I don't care if you're in trouble. You're my sister.\"\"I was better off dead to you. And that choice made you a whole lot greater than I could ever be, because you deserved—\"Aryn slaps her sister across the face, and Rayna recoils against the couch. \"You don't get to decide that for us. You made a promise,\" Aryn says, \"and you're so much more to me alive...\"Aryn raises her hand again, but it falls to her side. Rayna grasps her cheek. I can't shake the thought all I ever wanted, for years, was to yell the same way at my sibling after they left for the last time — but watching how it plays out secondhand is painful.\"Hey,\" I say. \"Let's continue next door. You both seem hungry.\"\"And why the Res would we do that?\" Aryn asks. \"You're interrupting something—\"I open the lid, and her expression quickly changes. \"Well . . . fine. But I'm not even close to done with her.\"\"That's fine,\" I say, wedging the door back open with my foot as I accept it's going to be a long night. \"Sit down on the couch, and I'll prepare something for you.\"Aryn still hesitates. It's hard to convince cats to do anything, so I act indifferent, rushing in to shutter my shades to forestall a deluge of difficult questions. They enter my world with a few steps at a time, then deposit themselves on the couch, as Aryn gears up to deliver another verbal lashing, but she's forestalled by the oddness of my world.I toss the glassware in the microwave as I think of all the things I longed to tell him, the thoughts so fresh in my mind that they were almost practiced.And they're still there. It takes the full three presses of the microwave's START button to even start to sort them out, and by the time I'm balancing the leftovers between two plates — and I serve them in the foyer — I open my mouth, feeling all the sadness of the last decade wash over me. When they see I've stopped holding back, they listen: my body shivers when I return to living in his last moments, but this time, it's no longer forced upon me by a nightmare. A day of exhaustion tears back the mechanisms that might protect me, without space for isolation or irony to invent an escape.\"Even through all this anger, you have a chance to start again,\" I say. \"I never got that.\"They blink at me, hesitating to take their first bite until I finish the thought.\"There's not a second I've lived since my brother died that I've been able to call my own,\" I confess, then I gasp, and it startles me: struggling to remember the last time I ever choked on a feeling."

            "\"He was a soldier,\" Aryn says. ",
            "\"Yeah. And then you think of the worst that can happen, and how you'd feel,\" I say, \"and in that way your mind tries to prepare you, like tensing up before a hit, though you never know when it's going to come. And then . . . it does, when you least expect it.\"",
            "\"What was it like to know?\" Aryn asks. \"Do you find closure? I had to convince myself of the worst when I went so long without knowing.\"",
            "\"You can hear it, cry about it, even see the body, and still not believe it for a while,\" I say, and remembering the first image halts the words. \"You start counting all the future moments you took for granted — and the more you look at all they left behind, the more you discover.\" ",
            "I think of the day my mother closed his bedroom door. Even through the first winter, we refused to enter to close his bedroom window from the summer, because he was still alive if we never checked: up late on the Xbox playing his favorite games, chatting over Discord, or curling weights in front of the mirror.",
            "The jacket of his unworn fatigues were shouldered around the chair at the head of the kitchen table, and mom always said he was just \"out with friends so he couldn't make supper.\" The joke held for years until we refurnished the dining room, and the aged jacket woven with DUNSMORE looked awkward on the high-back chairs.",
            "\"Training kept me busy. I was never forced to really face your absence,\" Aryn says, \"but then I came here, and I could no longer distance myself from the last place I knew you were.\" She takes her first bite, chewing slowly.",
            "Rayna says, \"and I never stopped thinking about you. I spent my whole life running, and when fate  finally brought me back here, Katiya gave me a second chance.\"",
            "Aryn swallows as I find I'm in my head again, then proceeds to speak. \"What made you stay, Rayna?\"",
            "\"Katiya showed me grace, and gave me a second chance. So I'm giving Katiya a chance to prove herself, because I think she's capable . . . and she has that spark that brings people together, which is the only way this can work.\"",
            "I fetch beers from the fridge now that the temperature of the room has dropped enough. I pour my last two craft beers in frozen mugs from the freezer after I wipe my nose, and as Rayna takes their last bite of the leftovers, I crack a cheap beer before heading back over.",
            "\"Thank you,\" Aryn says. She swirls the drink in the glass, then takes a sip to show she accepts my hospitality. \"I might no longer be fighting in memory, but the one thing we have in common is that we can both honor them.\"",
            "\"That's true,\" I say, drawing the can to my mouth with my trembling hands. ",
            "\"What was his name?\" Aryn asks.",
            "\"It was Jackson. Jackson Dunsmore,\" I say.",
            "\"I'm sure Jackson was a glorious warrior,\" Aryn says. \"So what will you do to honor him?\"",
            "\"I'll fix what killed him,\" I say.",
            "We sit around for about another half hour, and right about when my body begins to drag my eyelids shut, weighted by both emotional and physical exhaustion, Aryn and Rayna finally circle around to recounting their childhood memories.",
            "My head slides further down the couch the more the exhaustion of all my toil catches up to me, and as they ramble further — around ten minutes after ai add my last word — I finally give out, around the time they make the decision to leave together.",
            "Through heavy eyelids, I watch as Rayna takes a sheet from the same pad I wrote the rules on, tearing quietly along the perforations, and while she scribbles something with a pen, Aryn gingerly lifts my head before stuffing one of my mom's old decorative Christmas pillows in between.",
            "I don't resist when the weight of my tired body adheres to the fake leather like flies to honeyed paper, and as sleep muddles conscious thought into peaceful nonsense, Aryn whispers in my ear.",
            "\"I know you'll honor him well,\" she says, her nails tracing tufts of my unkempt, shaggy hair from covering my face.",
            "The two sisters leave my world and disappear back through Katiya's front door, leaving the click of the latch as the last sound I hear."

            "The house is silent when we return. I expect to find Rayna sitting in the foyer, but there's nothing here, and even with Cody's door ajar leaking light from another world, I don't hear him tinkering.",
            "Titus and Sylvia are the first to follow, then step to the side to remove their boots at the door. I begin to worry when neither Cody nor Rayna make a sound.",
            "I scan the shapes in this house silhouetted by another world's light.  The dining chairs are not in the same positions. The blanket that was on the couch is missing, and finally, when I look at the kitchen table, I find a smooth piece of Cody's engineering paper lifting at one corner.",
            "I read the page, expecting neat block letters in English to decorate the page — but it's my language, scribed like it was written in ballpoint pen by someone who's only ever used a quill.",
            "Katiya,",
            "Rayna is safe. She'll be staying with me for a while. We started a long conversation in her old home — your home — and Cody gave us a space to talk. We left to continue that.",
            "I'm not finished being angry. I'm torn between gratitude and hurt, and Rayna says I should talk to you, soon.",
            "Don't mistake this for forgiveness.",
            "Aryn Kesgrisin",
            "Sylvia's almost a head taller than me, and reads the letter over my shoulder. \"So it's just the three of us,\" she says.",
            "\"It seems that way,\" I say. I withdraw the smooth sphere from my pocket that Aliaki left me, resting it on the mantle of the fireplace: even with the slant of the aged surface, the marbled ball still refuses to roll. With one of the two spatial anchors left in my care, Aliaki vanished back to the wastes of Blackwater with the second. Jade seeks shelter somewhere else. ",
            "\"You were smart not to let them in,\" Sylvia says, peering through the doorway to Cody's world. \"Humans sense life and heat. But with space and time, there's no telling how many rules of nature this violates.\"",
            "\"I have an idea,\" I say, remembering back to the comment that Rayna made when we crossed back from the Shaleborough Renaissance Faire. There is no Essence over there, she said, and I knew that at least — but she didn't stop there. I only have half of the Ahkvasan gift, Rayna said, but I can tell that world is old: older than any piece of our world or its history. ",
            "Or so young that its fate hasn't been born yet: and so far away that any outcome of this world will never touch it.",
            "And I've tried to stop thinking about it ever since.",
            "\"They'll have to hear about it at some point. I agreed to set this house as an anchor for one end of those . . . things,\" I say, trying not to think of that either — threatening to twist both my stomach and my mind.",
            "\"We have our work cut out for us,\" Titus says, but I still can't shake the revelation from the scuffle.",
            "\"Why didn't you tell me about your status?\" I ask. \"I know you have every reason to keep it secret, but . . . if you can tell me now, what happened?\"",
            "He looks to Sylvia, then back to me, calculating the bare minimum of what he can tell. \"Let's just say we're refugees for a different reason. Our lives were threatened if we stayed there, but not from hunger.\"",
            "\"You're both masks, then?\"",
            "\"Not quite,\" he says. \"I'm just learning my limits, but Khi— erm, Sylvia is something else, and not even she knows hers.\"",
            "I have so much more to ask but I refuse to test their patience. I doubt there's an upper bound to their goodwill, but I'm too afraid to ask about all the Essence events up north — uncertain whether I harbor valiant saviors, or terrorists of another land.",
            "\"Maybe we can talk when this is over,\" Titus offers to the silence. ",
            "The two settle in on the first floor again, rifling through their meager sled of possessions. I cross over to find Cody fast asleep on the couch with the missing blanket from my world tucked beneath his head. Beyond the near ream of crumpled pages, scrawled around the coffee table with his ideas, the dwindling pad of engineering paper has a familiar style of writing scrawled across it:",
            "Thanks for the kind words, the food, and the company. I know you'll find your way to honor your brother's memory.",
            "I find another blanket on the floor. It smells like him, and I take a big exhale when I find he's still fast asleep, his eyelids worn with deeper crescents than I've ever seen, and I find it saddens me to see him so worn from all the effort.",
            "He's a warrior in his own way, I think, realizing the man I've come to adore looks nothing like the noble I one mistook him for. I tuck the blanket around him, wondering how many days we have left to express our feelings for each other, and as he stirs in his sleep, finding that love for him grow with every breath that leaves his lungs.",
            "I settle for a kiss on his forehead — sitting beside him as long as it takes to drink to this renewable feeling of joy. He melts the fear of the past and future, and as I cling to this precious moment, I make a risky decision for a chance to cuddle."

            "I wake to the ache in my ankle before the alarm I set last night, when I knew the talk with Aryn and Rayna would drag on for hours. My back still rests against the soft cushions of the couch — my head supported by the pillow Aryn left for me — and as I twist my ankle to find the source of that unfamiliar pain, I don't feel the friction of the faux leather, but the comfort of a mattress.",
            "The light from the window radiates the back of my head instead of my legs: the last I remember, I was pointed toward the kitchen, and as I feel myself overheat from the thick comforter and the cushions behind me, wrapped so tightly that I can't move my arms, I finally open my eyes, taking in the sight of a different view as I struggle to reach for my phone.",
            "I feel the texture of the coffee table as I brush across the surface with my fingers, but it's not as smooth as I remember it. My myopic eyes can't reconcile the shapes since I didn't sleep in my contacts, and after I knock over a glass of water and a lamp, I find an unexpected edge to the coffee table — realizing it's my nightstand.",
            "The couch reacts to the crash, and it grabs me tighter, with arms around my body tighter than a grade-schooler's backpack. I trace through my mind for forgotten memories of a brown-out, but I can only remember having two drinks before I passed out on the couch — not enough to convince me that furniture has arms that can move.",
            "But I'm certain that I'm in my bedroom, and it's the first time since Katiya showed her fire tricks that I've been in such a state of disbelief. My ankle still hurts from something I don't remember, and I'm beginning to believe I drank more than I thought.",
            "\"Gods above,\" Katiya says: loosening her grasp on me but still not letting go. \"You were a real heavy sleeper until now!\"",
            "I rub my eyes, deciding to relish in her warmth a little longer as I reconcile what the two cushions were. \"What happened last night?\"",
            "\"You fell asleep,\" she says. \"Your body is a tool: you can't sprawl it across a couch when you're not using it, or else you'll feel it in the morning. And the next few days are critical for us.\"",
            "I reach to rub out the pain in my ankle. It really hurts. \"Then why do I feel pain that I don't remember?\"",
            "\"Story of my life,\" she says, then laughs. \"I might have caught an edge or two getting you off the couch.\"",
            "\"Getting me off the couch?\" I ask, and finally turn to face her. She's wearing a night shirt: her hair dishevelled, with a mischievous grin as I try to piece all this together. \"Did I sleepwalk with you? I don't remember ever getting up.\"",
            "\"It's not Auvryan mind magic! You never got up. You were still asleep,\" she says. \"I think I hit your ankle on that turn of the stairs.\"",
            "\"So you...\"",
            "\"So I...\"",
            "\"Carried me upstairs?\" I ask, as a bead of sweat drips down my forehead.",
            "She laughs.  \"We only get a few more nights to have a chance to cuddle. It's Frosthide . . . or winter, so I need all the warmth I can get.\"",
            "I throw off the damp sheets, saturated with my sweat, to find I'm still wearing my work clothes from the day before. \"And why am I still wearing clothes?\"",
            "Her face scrunches. \"You think I would undress you while you were unconscious?\" She pinches the single bedsheet that still separates us. \"I'm not an animal.\"",
            "\"Only an animal would have the strength to carry me upstairs!\" I say, trying my feet on the carpet as I add weight to the hurt in my ankle. I hear an alarm go off, but it's not my phone.",
            "\"Don't worry. I set an alarm for 0830,\" Katiya says. She grabs her smartphone as I squint my eyes to look at the clock, and just as I'm about to leave the bed, I feel her hands at my sides, pulling be back into her grasp.",
            "\"I'm overheating,\" I say. \"Let me get a layer off!\"",
            "She relents. \"Just do it slowly.\"",
            "I strip down to my underwear, then sniff the sweat beneath my armpit that hasn't had a chance to dry yet. ",
            "\"I need a shower first.\"",

            "\"Just shut up for a while,\" she coos. \"Please, Cody. Just a little longer.\"",
            "I take my free hand and grab the thin sheet that's always separated us. I throw it over her side, exposing her in places I haven't seen yet — and find she's wearing my Hybrid Theory T-shirt, as well as a pair of my (clean) boxers as boyshorts.",
            "She blushes for a second, covering herself with her hands before she realizes she doesn't mind. \"It's cold,\" she complains.",
            "\"You don't get cold,\" I say, noticing all the scars across her body as I slide back into bed. \"And why are you wearing my clothes?\"",
            "She smirks. \"Would you prefer that I give them back to you?\"",
            "\"It's fine,\" I say. \"I think we're getting to the point that what's mine is yours.\"",
            "\"I can take them off another time,\" she says, reaching for her phone to set a timer for another thirty minutes, and when my bare legs wrap between hers, and I feel the warmth of her as she nuzzles herself in the space beneath my chin, I relish the peace of this moment — only stopping to read the five texts on my watch from my phone downstairs.",
