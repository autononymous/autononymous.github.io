<p>&emsp;I grasp my chest where the dagger protrudes from between my ribs. Blood collects in my mouth as I cough crimson, every spurious fit driving the sharp edge deeper into my flesh as I sprawl against the deep, crumbling walls of the Undercroft, in a cavern so far below the mountains of the Afterlife. But the pain is so slowly fading away, along with the composure to form thoughts.</p>
<p>&emsp;My memories spill from the crack in my skull when the rock struck my head. I can see my vision feathering away. The names of friends and adversaries blur until they&apos;re primal feelings, and as I struggle to hold on to my thoughts &mdash; at least until the Thread can bring me back &mdash; I can feel the ground tremble beneath my feet at another failure.</p>
<p>&emsp;The Goddess stands in her tremendous form, shouldering the weight of the upper floors of the Undercroft, watching me bleed out without any chance for salvation, and though my senses have gone numb, I cry out with anguish when I can&apos;t remember her name.</p>
<p>&emsp;The cross-blooded Mask is crumpled on the ground across from me: impaled through her chest by the sharp end of a scythe, and though she brought the torment that destroyed the entire city of . . . of the city, I feel a similar feeling of anguish in watching a piece of me die.</p>
<p>&emsp;But it&apos;s the old man that reaches for the spade that concerns me the most. It will all be for naught if I don&apos;t kill myself first. And so I find my limbs still willing to obey my commands in the absence of pain. They run on the last spark of energy, and when I lift myself from the wall, limping towards the stubborn old man dragging himself across the floor, I stumble.</p>
<p>&emsp;His lips are still able to form words. &quot;You can&apos;t go back there all the way, my son. You will never be able to go back there! Why do you hold so tightly to a defeated world? &quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I grumble incoherent words, trudging further as my vision loses its color. The entire mountain is now shouldered by the strength of the Goddess, but it wavers, casting a hastening staccato of stones in the spaces around us.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let me return,&quot; he pleads. &quot;I&apos;ll unwrite all of this. As many times as it takes to save you. To save our people. To save our family from what happened in that cabin. To go back further! To bring you into a world free from all this chaos. To actually be your father, and for you and your sister to live in a loving fami&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;A falling boulder crushes his ribs, taking the words from his mouth. All that&apos;s left is the faculties of his mind: the two of us in a battle of death since this one ends in a stalemate.</p>
<p>&emsp;I should be used to dying at this point. Yet I can&apos;t even remember the first time it happened. I can&apos;t even remember the names of the full fireteam I lost to get here; of my adopted family; of my cherished best friends or the woman I never got to tell that I love her.</p>
<p>&emsp;Fate decides for us when we hold that hesitation to die. Even the Goddess refuses to let me die. The shadow of a great stone column shades my surroundings. The Thread on my wrist throbs as it glows with the light of life, and as it begins to drag my consciousness with an inertia that spans time, I can see myself standing there on that stage all those months ago. And as my father tries to&mdash;</p>

<p>&emsp;&mdash;say that if there is anything, dear Firebrands, that you take from this speech, I want you to remember one thing. Your sacrifice is what allows the acolytes of the Afterlife to barter with the Gods,&quot; General Ullrich says. &quot;We have always had just enough to feed everyone. The Gods satiate us with sustenance for our prayers. And from sacrifice, we have just enough to protect the last bastion of our people against the evil of the Chymaerans. But this is always just barely enough.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;An applause circulates the stadium like cracking ice. We are enclaved by the vast unknown of the lifeless, frozen wasteland: our race fording a frozen river we should have fallen into ages ago. Every year we treat graduation as if it were the last, because all we&apos;ve ever hoped for is just a way to stay alive.</p>
<p>&emsp;The grand auditorium of the Academy is open to the impossibly warm air. The ashen smog is too thin here to obscure our sight and poison our lungs. Many see the sky for the first time in years, migrating up the mountainside to visit their children in this moment of bittersweet celebration.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Twelve thousand students in this graduating class of northern Blackwater. Only two hundred of you will defend the Afterlife as Royal Guards. Five thousand more will defend the lower city. And the rest will fight to defend our frostbitten foothold as soldiers on the front lines, fighting the Chymaera. But I want you to think of the others that never even joined: toiling as power-workers and miners that never see this glorious purpose thorugh. To the fighting Firebrands on the front lines, I want you all to remember: you are the greatest asset our people have.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Ullrich&apos;s eyes fall to the span of seats roughly sixty-percent back, notably dotted with absent chairs. It&apos;s no wonder us cadets are called suicide scholars: either signed on by family that birthed them for the stipend, or by the passionate tales in Seminary motivating them to sign away their life &mdash; as early as they learn how to write the letters of their name.</p>
<p>&emsp;Several cadets far behind us retch into the bags tucked beneath their seats, masked over by the fanfare of instruments stationed directly behind them. Curious, my fingers fumble beneath my seat to find there is nothing there &mdash; but I&apos;m close enough to touch the stage. </p>
<p>&emsp;Ullrich continues, as the orchestra finds the perfect balance, between muting out the cries of panic and allowing Ullrich&apos;s words to resound in hallowed glory.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I am infinitely proud of every single one of you. We will always be at war with the Chymaera. But it&apos;s&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All a lie!&quot; one of the lower Cadets yells. There are several in the aisle creeping towards the stage. But the Royal Guard are quick to put them down and drag them away. Uncertainty is an illness that slowly metastasizes in the soul. All they know is that one returns for every fifteen they send into the meat grinder. They even dig the graves before they leave, to pretend there is something there beneath. </p>
<p>&emsp;At least suicide leaves something. If they die, not even a single piece of them will return to attest to their life.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;It&apos;s a fight worth having,&quot; Ullrich says. The orchestra has to improvise to keep the lost time. &quot;We are the last survivors of this frozen world where none of us ever asked to be born. But we are here. And you . . . we, owe it to each other, to defend the sanctity of this chance at life. To give everything. To lose yourselves in the beauty of this divine sacrifice ever since the fall of our people. To pay the debt they left behind. To have a chance to return to that golden age!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The choir crescendos with their chorus. Ullrich raises his hands as the unsetting sun penetrates the clouds of smog. Rays of light reach the Afterlife first before the leftovers illuminate our pallid faces, and the Royal Guards applaud and cheer, followed by the cheers of the crowd, booming like the songs of worship we sing to the Afterlife&apos;s central peaks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And to provide the last words of this benediction is a cadet that needs no introduction,&quot; Ullrich says. I feel Romin&apos;s massive hand grasp my left shoulder with pride, muttering either one of his jokes or words of encouragement. Sylvia grasps my right hand before she nervously withdraws. And Valentina peeks her head over Sylvia&apos;s shoulder, expecting me to smile with some strong sense of pride for what it&apos;s taken me to get here.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not only did his quartet of Fireteammates place in the top three combat scores of their class, but he obtained a one-hundred-and-five percent score on his exit exams. He scores higher than the East, South, and West Academies. And yet I&apos;m told he still finds enough time to care for his sister, and to work alongside his father. He is the pride of our people, and everything that any Cadet should aspire to.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The left and right sections of underclassmen turn to me. I feel the intensity of all the eyes in the auditorium, but I can&apos;t hear the words of encouragement; feel the strangers patting my back and asking me how I pulled it off. It&apos;s not nervousness that muffles their voices, mutes their touch, or softens their glances of misplaced admiration. I&apos;m not afraid of that unpracticed string of words I&apos;ll share, because I know how exactly how to deceive them into thinking they&apos;re special like Ullrich does.</p>
<p>&emsp;I reach to shake Ullirch&apos;s hand as he smiles. </p>
<p>&emsp;The applause is deafening and insincere. Ullrich extends his hand as I climb the stairs, timed so perfectly to the music like all his appearances: like one of Valentina&apos;s famous moving pictures, or composed like one of Sylvia&apos;s commissioned paintings.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ve got such a brilliant future ahead of you, son,&quot; he says, speaking as if I were one of his own, but then the sudden onset of a splitting headache nearly casts me down.</p>
<p>&emsp;The world goes dark, as if I stand in a cave. </p>
<p>&emsp;The ground trembles beneath me. </p>
<p>&emsp;I can taste the iron as it condenses on my tongue, vanishing from palate it slides down my throat. I can smell that horrid smell of burning rubber, ozone, and rotten flesh of a million dead liquidated faster than they could react. I remember the feelings I had never felt before: of a true steadfast resilience, of burning resentment, and the fading faces of cherished friends and family I swore I&apos;d never forget. I&apos;m so angry when I can&apos;t remember the names of people I&apos;ve never met, while the voice pleads for me to resign this life and let them take over.</p>
<p>&emsp;But the command of that phantasmal projectionist fades, and though he pleads in my mind with words that sound like my own, he&apos;s too weak to take over.</p>
<p>&emsp;Ullrich stabilizes me with a familiar touch.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Are you alright?&quot; He asks. &quot;What happened this time?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;But my mind is still sharp.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Think I overestimated how much to drink to get me through this speech.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;He laughs, clapping me gently on the back.</p>
<p>&emsp;I grasp my head as I approach the podium with a brilliant smile. I refuse to cast my eyes to the vacancy unfilled by my adopted father and sister. And it&apos;s when I rest my hands on the podium that I realize I feel nothing; absolutely nothing at all. </p>
<p>&emsp;I was foolish to think this moment would feel any different than all the others.</p>
<p>&emsp;The throbbing in the birthmark on my wrist is the last discomfort to subside. All that&apos;s left is the eternal chill of Blackwater, the last frostbitten city of the Humans. And after I pause long enough for effect, waiting a little longer . . . and a little longer . . . I open my mouth to speak the first uninspired words, telling them exactly what they want to hear.</p>

<p>&emsp;The skyline burns in the light of an everlasting sun. Blistering winds raise the virgin snow into clouds of shimmering flakes, blending the distant foilage of the tundra into the ancient sheets of frost. Dry snowbanks of frigid, grating ice stretch further than my eyes can focus, cracking like dead leaves in the wake of my footfalls. </p>
<p>&emsp;I am a Snowdrifter, and this is my last adventure: tethering the line of danger and death in pursuit of artifacts from a long-past age. Only the poor dare to venture beyond the walls of the the last city, seeking treasures and wares to sell to others who have the money to collect them. But for this last trip, I&apos;m not alone. </p>
<p>&emsp;We unwrap the scarves from our faces when the smoke no longer saturates our lungs, trading breath behind fabric for the freshness of the biting cold. Furs cover every surface of our flesh with at least an inch of insulation, trapping snowflakes between strands of fur like flies to honeyed paper. </p>
<p>&emsp;Somewhere hours behind us, the last city of Blackwater awakens. Streetlamps of lighttime set civilians on their schedule in the absence of a setting sun. Turbines churn power into the veins of the Humans&apos; last city, pumping life and heat into a dying, frostbitten husk: a heat we don&apos;t have his far beyond the walls.</p>
<p>&emsp;But there&apos;s a different way to keep warm, even if it stings.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin takes swigs from the bottle to warm his insides, casting me in the shadow of his stature. His dark skin sweats from internal heat as he carries the weight of all his corded muscle. The warmth of liquor gives us enough breath to speak, despite how the frigid air burns our lungs. And he does enough speaking for the two of us, passing time in chaff by listing as many as he can remember.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot; . . . And then the one girl I snuck off with after the end of Seminary. Then that one broad from down the hall, you know, when we moved into the Lofts: the one that said she worked with livestock. I&apos;m not sure what she did with the animals, but she changed my whole view of what a woman can do.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;My lungs burn on a laugh as he takes a deep swig, using the bottle to punctuate his sentences. </p>
<p>&emsp;He says, &quot;I think that woman ruined my sense of taste!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, really?&quot; I ask. &quot;Becuase you think you can do any better?&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;Half the time I think he&apos;s off on a bit, but this time, it&apos;s too hard to tell. Romin spent the last hour recounting the names of all his sexual partners. The hour before, he recounted his plans for life after service in the Royal Guard, and how he plans to spend all his money. And now that the booze blocks his memory, he uses the next hour to badger me again with the same stupid question.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I invited myself to come because I was afraid you weren&apos;t planning on coming back. Gods above, the years you spent getting to this point . . . and when they want to throw a lavish party in your honor, you turn them down for this?&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;He gestures at the barren landscape. Trapped in an open room of white flakes, there&apos;s nothing to see except the silhouettes of trees, the sky above us, and maybe rogue bands of Chymaerans, concealing their slender limbs in the branches. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods above, Titus! You&apos;re the Valedictorian of all the Academies,&quot; Romin says. &quot;You should be using it to get everything you can. It&apos;s the anxiety of what comes next that makes all the sex so much better.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t do it for recognition,&quot; I tell him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then for what? You&apos;re not weak like the lower ranks. You&apos;ve made it,&quot; he insists. &quot;We made it. Our whole Fireteam did. Did you know that eight percent of graduates this year iced themselves?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. And I saw the empty seats from the stage at graduation.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course, our Fireteam is good enough to defend the city: top one percent. But if you were with those losers, wouldn&apos;t it be better to die beyond the walls? Taking the fight to the Chymaera, rather than falling on your own blade?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re not losers. It&apos;s not their fault: most are coerced into it, even bred for it. Some send their sons and daughters to the Academy with apathy for what comes after. They crank out kids like rabbits for the welfare &mdash; train them high enough to get into an upper class, and you&apos;re relieved of poverty for as long as they can study.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you were adopted,&quot; Romin says. &quot;And your father wastes his own money, not yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, he wastes my money, too,&quot; I say. &quot;He gets most of the check.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;But you don&apos;t have the ties of blood like us, so why did you even bother? What made you fight?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A feeling,&quot; I tell him. </p>
<p>&emsp;A feeling I&apos;ve had since as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A feeling?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What kind of feeling?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I tell him, because I don&apos;t have the words. Somewhere between desperate longing and crippling anxiety. It&apos;s been so long that I can only remember the experiences that shaped it. </p>
<p>&emsp;So many years ago in that orphanage with Sylvia, it came from a dream I had. When  I was watching all the other kids get adopted. When I had a bedroom window facing the impassable gates. All I ever wanted was to be good enough for a mom and dad &mdash; knowing if I turned eighteen, they&apos;d pitch me on the side of the road and I&apos;d end up like the homeless outwallers. Maybe it&apos;s been raising my sister after my father gave up. Or maybe it was just a spark based off some childish thought &mdash; like revenge against fate, or some innocent dream of grandeur.</p>
<p>&emsp;He offers his bottle to usher me further, and after a sip, I try again.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All I&apos;ve ever thought of in this life is what I still have to do, and the people I have to do it for.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. Because winning just happens &mdash; not from all those nights you turned down our adventures for studying. I know they blend together, but . . . can&apos;t you remember any of it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course!&quot; There&apos;s too many to count. &quot;The time we explored the pitch-dark drainage tunnels in first year? When you led us from the front, screaming that you saw something? And we ran? How Valentina tore and dirtied up her dress so bad we had to cover her with your coat, or else she&apos;d be parading the halls in her underwear?&quot; I expose the flesh on my left arm. A small staccato of scars spans the space above the birthmark on my wrist. &quot;I sure remember how infected this got.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He laughs. &quot;Oh, and the . . . and the time after that when Sylvia drank for the first time?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I remember how close she got to me when we were in the hallway alone. My heart was pounding. She hunched over so far we were at eye level. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I still have that picture she drew &mdash; I framed it on the wall because she hides it every time I leave it out. You think I could sell it to some rich Merlotan family twenty years from now?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The thought makes him laugh. The cold makes him cough and stumble. &quot;Gods above. The darling artist whose Academy posters are all over Blackwater. How would those filthy-rich Merlotan pigs try to brag about it on the wall over cheese and crackers?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I imagine Valentina&apos;s family &mdash; expensive drink in one hand, the other gesturing to the marble plaque below the framed napkin on the wall. Oh, I can see it . . . that pretentious cursive serif they use, etched black. With two words.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I let the image stew for a while. Romin takes a swig of the moonshine his Carmine brotherhood makes, and I only speak when the bottle is upsidedown in my mouth.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin spits. It almost shoots out his nose before he can regain himself. He drops the lead of his sled and almost disappears into the virgin snow before he finds his breath again, laughing hysterically. &quot;That&apos;s not what I saw at all. But you&apos;re right! Gods above &mdash; I must have had it upside-down.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Isn&apos;t that how all art works?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I guess. Unless it has letters on it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He chuckles a couple times before finding his composure. I ruffle my jet-black beard. &quot;See, I didn&apos;t forget the stuff that matters.  I just remember . . . how you guys made me feel, you know, despite how distant I was. Like I was always welcome to return when I was ready.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, it&apos;s over now. You never &apos;got&apos; ready. And now we&apos;re out past the walls, telling jokes on the edge of death. You gave up a fully-funded Academy celebration to trudge around outside the walls and act poor. We&apos;ve made it, Titus! Maybe we&apos;ll never be as rich as Valentina, but you don&apos;t need to do this anymore. To trudge through snow for several days? Dragging back ancient knick-knacks and forbidden books? So that rich Merlotans can buy them from your father&apos;s eternal rummage sale, and plant them on their mantle as a talking piece?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not about that,&quot; I insist. &quot;Not this time. I&apos;m not going to be down in the lower city anymore, so Ellie and Clint will have to manage on their own. It&apos;s about something else. This map&mdash;&quot; but he ignores me, with that lofty look that sticks in his eyes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I thought I had power this close to the top, but you&apos;re on a whole other level. You could have done anything! Hold a party on the Academy&apos;s money, plaster your name and face on everything, and you could take any broad home you want. And if you played it right, maybe two or three, if they were some of those cadets below second rank looking to pop their cherry, before they&apos;re sent off to get iced by the Chymaera.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d take adventure over all that social posturing any day,&quot; I say. &quot;You think it would ever end up about me? I&apos;m not about that. And talking to leadership is like watching old people eat. No &mdash; it is watching old people eat. That&apos;s the only reason any instructors or cadets would show up: to load their plates first, and act like they&apos;re there for me second.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, I get it,&quot; Romin says. &quot;If you want someone to blow your horn all night, you&apos;d rather have your lady do it in private.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, screw off,&quot; I tell him. Usually he cracks a smile trying to get a rise out of me, but is as if there&apos;s some truth he found snared in it.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All that time you spend in the Academy lofts, doing whatever it is you do, we hardly see you. Gods above, you should&apos;ve heard what Sylvia said the other night. Val and I coaxed her out and bought her some drinks.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What did she say?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why should I tell you?&quot; he says &quot;You weren&apos;t there to hear it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My eyes return to the ground. I built walls around a tightness in my chest, and for a second, I catch myself thinking he understands.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin says, &quot;I get why you&apos;re upset. We&apos;re all going through change. All those cadets and their foursome Fireteams might never talk again. It&apos;s so hard to believe that, especially after every group has been together this long.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re right. It&apos;s just been hard,&quot; I say, because lying is easy. I&apos;ve practiced so many times on my younger sister Ellie that it&apos;s second nature. &quot;It&apos;s just the guilt of all those cadets that aren&apos;t going to make it,&quot; I come up with.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s not your fault.&quot; He places his hand on my shoulder. &quot;If leading the Carmine has taught me anything, it&apos;s that people are addicted to a free ride, and none want to pay the ticket when it&apos;s due.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The civvies call us suicide scholars for a reason. The money is tempting. And yet, regardless of all that empty land near the outer walls, they never seem to run out of space.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;But it&apos;s not your fault,&quot; Romin repeats. &quot;You don&apos;t get to feel guilty for succeeding when we were only born into this system. We earned this. We signed up for this just like they did. You can&apos;t achieve anything without stepping on someone else, so you might as well do it with force.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But some of them were born just for the stipend,&quot; I say. &quot;And others are adopted, like me, for that same reason.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, come on. Your mother and father loved you!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Emilia loved me,&quot; I say. &quot;And ever since that night, I&apos;ve done it all alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ve all been alone. Wading through so much shit we lost all sense of smell. But there&apos;s something more, waiting after all of that. Can&apos;t you feel it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;That bottomless pit in my stomach. </p>
<p>&emsp;The guilt of inaction. </p>
<p>&emsp;The fear of every possibility forking everywhere at the same time, and always wondering if I lost the true path some0time long ago.</p>
<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;Maybe I&apos;ve always felt it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;This is a new beginning, Titus. Leaders do nothing compared to the weaker ones below them. We&apos;ll be serving the acolytes of the Gods whose prayer feeds our entire city. Above the clouds where Essence will keep us warm. And we&apos;ll be doing nothing &mdash; who fights the chosen ones in the central peaks of the Afterlife? Who bites the hand that feeds them? And after service, we&apos;ll settle down. You and Sylvia, and me and Valentina &mdash; unless I hit it off with some divine broad up there.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;d do that?&quot; I ask. &quot;You&apos;d betray us so easily?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Never. You&apos;re my best friend. I&apos;d never leave you behind.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s what I thought.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;...Unless you got in my way,&quot; he says.</p>

<p>&emsp;Romin runs his mouth further, his words stoking our conversation like a fire on its last log. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, but seriously. Sylvia might be tall and thick, but Valentina&apos;s that perfect kind of short, you know? Like, thick-short. but the good kind of thick, and the good kind of short. Like trees versus shrubs, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I laugh. &quot;I don&apos;t know, Romin.&quot; He passes a sip from his bottle of cinnamon whisky to give a nice warmth without heat. The liquor stings my throat as his two neurons debate what he&apos;s going to say next. He&apos;s pretty good in school, yet I wonder if the only functioning parts of his intoxicated brain are women and combat.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Valentina&apos;s got that feminine charm, too. It&apos;s why she&apos;s so popular. It&apos;s why she&apos;s been an actress in all the Academy flicks &mdash; hic &mdash; and why she&apos;s so famous,&quot; he says. &quot;To be a daughter of the Merlot &mdash; with all that wealth and power &mdash; that persona is what makes you feel so high and unreachable to everyone else. That&apos;s the true definition of power. And she can help me get there, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s eyes glass over like marbles with a familiar glance. It&apos;s the same gaze when he looks upon the statue of his brother, immortalized in bronze, holding the sword that supposedly impaled him when he was serving out beyond the walls fighting the Chymaera. I&apos;m not surprised when he brings him up again.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Funny how the anniversary of Ryder&apos;s sacrifice comes around at the same time that we graduate. It&apos;s too bad he can&apos;t see how the Carmine of our district celebrate him,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s the only thing that sucks about dying, with the warrior&apos;s fate that awaits us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not getting to see the people back home carry your name. My statue&apos;s gonna be massive, you know. Bigger than . . . well, very big.&quot; He hesitates.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I hope your statue is looking up, at least,&quot; I tell him. &quot;From how flat your head is after your mother never turned you, I bet the brothers of the Carmine could fry an egg on there if they ever got hungry.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He rubs sweat from his skull. &quot;Not a chance!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I guess it never gets warm enough,&quot; I say.  &quot;Unless your ego was trapped in there. Then brothers could use it as a hand-warmer after a long day&apos;s work!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That statue would melt,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I add, &quot;just from catching rays of light on all that surface. They&apos;ll have to depict you a lot smaller, but you don&apos;t mind, do you? Gods above, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s enough metal in all of Blackwater.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re not calling me fat, are you? It&apos;s muscle,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;re a twig. I bet even Sylvia could crush you if she wasn&apos;t so busy with her soft hobbies all the time...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Taller doesn&apos;t mean stronger,&quot; I say, huffing between breaths. Laughter draws a cough, and the back of my throat stings. It always feels like any meaningful talk between us gets derailed by playful insults. So I bring us back. &quot;But do you like it?&quot; I asked him. &quot;The Carmine, I mean. You were kind of born into it without a choice.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course I do,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m the future of the clan. One day I&apos;ll lead the whole district. How could I not be proud of that?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He beats his chest in pride. All I can think of is the medical report on his desk I stumbled upon days earlier, from his fifth visit to the medics that month. I didn&apos;t know if it was the smoking or the drinking &mdash; but it said he had ulcers, and the heart of someone twice his age.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Enough about me and Val, then,&quot; Romin says, &quot;what about Sylvia? What do you like about her so much?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I liked her before I learned true human nature. In our culture is a nature of apathy towards children who share no familial blood. The value of a family is constituted by the strength of its children, and their service as Cadets in the Academy. The higher their echelon &mdash; the higher their children&apos;s class in the Academy &mdash; the greater the stipend that family receives, so I spent my whole childhood being dissuaded that any kind of love could be unrequited.</p>
<p>&emsp;I was only eight years old when I started training myself, beaten down by kids twice my size, making fun of me for entering Seminary combat school two years early, just because of how badly I longed for a chance to be worthy. All the strongest kids were taken from the orphanage. My room was next to Sylvia&apos;s, and both our windows faced the entry walkway, watching daily as child-after-child was taken to a new home. Those kids achieved something in those fleeting moments we could only ever watch with sickening envy, and all we could do was wonder what was wrong with us. That competitiveness conjured a cruelty among the children that could have cut us deep. That was, not unless we built something stronger; not if one of us was able to protect the other.</p>
<p>&emsp;I learned more about fighting in the orphanage than I did in any combat school. The malice of that toxicity &mdash; not just among the children, but the caregivers who weren&apos;t paid enough to care &mdash; bred it even further. I passed Sylvia words of reassurance when the crimson ring of her iris led her to the name &quot;Blood Eyes.&quot; I fought with my fists and teeth to protect her. If no one was around to keep me safe or show me love, then I would incarnate it. When I watched the reprieve in her eyes when I defended her, I could live through it. I could feel through it, visualizing as if our roles were switched, that intangible, unconditional love I lusted for so strongly, resting in Sylvia&apos;s respite, and I tried to imagine how it felt. I knew it was selfish. All I could accept was that these circumstances had broken me. I could never accept the façade of love, hidden behind so many layers of primal, selfish desire, but there was something special with her, that she knew me before that, that she stayed with me all this time for some reason beyond logic. All I know is that it was never love, but something else, something&mdash;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus!&quot; He shoulders me lightly, still enough to nearly send me into a snowbank. &quot;Are you gonna dream about her, or give me an answer?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s nice,&quot; I tell Romin. &quot;And with her medical specialization, she&apos;s really smart about that stuff.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;Even after I was adopted four years later, taken in by a new caretaker that arrived at the orphanage, the pressure to perform still follows me. My adoptive mother Emilia always said she fell in love with me. My combat skills were pretty impressive by that point, and my knowledge was three grades ahead, so I guessed I earned it. But it was always that smolder in my mother&apos;s eyes when she watched me that made me uncomfortable: as if she loved me for something else, but I never came to understand. I found that same look in Sylvia&apos;s eyes whenever I talked to her.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because she&apos;s nice?&quot; Romin asks. &quot;Every other day you&apos;re in her room,&quot; he says. &quot;I know you&apos;re not talking. And I don&apos;t need to check her room for dents behind the headboard.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ve never made it that far. Honest,&quot; I say. &quot;We&apos;re close friends: it&apos;d be too uncomfortable.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He stops so I have to turn to meet his eyes through the slit of a face-wrapped scarf. His glare tries to break the tell, but there&apos;s nothing else there.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Honest,&quot; I mumble from beneath the fabric.</p>
<p>&emsp;He continues dragging the sled. &quot;Yeah. Friends, huh,&quot; Romin says. He takes the last swig of his bottle before throwing it aside &mdash; washing that word out as if the scotch were less bitter. &quot;I&apos;m pretty sure you&apos;re more than that.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Silence hangs between us again. Men don&apos;t always have to talk: their minds can race on nothing unless interrupted. Romin is a talkative drunk, but after so many nights out, we always expect to find him snoring in a corner once the liquor runs out. But soon we&apos;ll approach the safehouse that provides our shelter for the night: the station I&apos;ve visited hundreds of times before, the same dot on the map etched in my mind from years of travel. </p>
<p>&emsp;The same brand of anxiety that kept me at the top of my game settles on the fear of this long distance from the walls: not the eerie silence that&apos;s almost become nostalgic, but the fact that this is the farthest I&apos;ve ever gone. It&apos;s a trip that lasts more than a single night, and it almost bothers me more that I&apos;m unafraid.</p>
<p>&emsp;Why do I feel that I am going to die out here? Is that what I want? Am I one of those suicide scholars that takes their own life before the service? My future isn&apos;t beyond the walls. It&apos;s in serving in the lands above. But that crescendo of circles on the map left by my grandfather&mdash;far outside the two-day-trip circle I charted in my own ink&mdash;leads me onward on one final Snowdrifting expedition. All I can hope to find is one thing: what that wordless, regretful terror was that consumed him in the end, when the ability to sleep was stolen from him by the Chymaeran Curse. His hands trembled. His writing accelerated. He mumbled and cried about something he had forgotten. They told us he died in his sleep, but I knew that was a lie. He stayed awake for a full month before he died&mdash;the autopsy says his brain dissolved to a tenth of its size. </p>
<p>&emsp;How could you tell it was the curse? I asked. </p>
<p>&emsp;Because brain matter doesn&apos;t glow purple, they said.</p>

<p>&emsp;The safehouse is the same as I left it. It doesn&apos;t surprise me. Few Snowdrifters would ever dare to travel this far. I can tell, as soon as I find the strategic surplus of spare rations I left months before in the corner, the only reflective thing unsullied by layers of dust&mdash;beyond the drag marks on the table when I swiped a silver candlestick. </p>
<p>&emsp;The building was once a two-bedroom cabin, but there&apos;s only one now. I was ecstatic when I found it a few years back, because it has a stone fireplace. When I rushed through the house to take a survey of the rooms by opening all the doors, I was surprised to find the master bedroom  was remodeled to a snow-covered balcony after the roof collapsed. I sealed off the door two trips ago to keep the heat inside, because no amount of Essence can ever acclimate a house to heat when there&apos;s a broken window or a cracked door.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I think I&apos;ll continue this drunk until we get back,&quot; Romin says. &quot;I saw the rations, did you leave the liquor, too?&quot; He inspects the bottles on the shelf above the roaring fireplace. &quot;I&apos;ve never even heard of this stuff before.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He uncorks the bottle, releasing a long-fermenting odor into the air that makes him gag. He hesitates. A few seconds later, he cautiously draws a sip to his lips, tasting it like he&apos;s one of those refined Vermillions as he swishes the bottle around, aerating the long-aged liquor like a dog lapping water. Satisfied, he shrugs at me, continuing to chug several more gulps of it.</p>
<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;You know, there&apos;s Merlotan royals that would probably pay a hundred Kine just for a shot of that. We&apos;d probably sell it if they ever came down to our shop themselves, instead of sending their servants.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He clutches his chest and grunts. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods above, this must be what that Chymaeran Curse is like. It feels like death, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A lot of things feel like death,&quot; I say. </p>
<p>&emsp;Together, we look out through the tears in the sheet that insulates the window. The sun dips below the horizon, casting shadows across all the landscape. It never gets high enough to brighten the world without help from electric light, but nor does it ever dip low enough for its influence to disappear completely. Though it hides behind the hills, it leaves an eerie glow in the sky, illuminating the two moons in pale green and ruddy orange.</p>
<p>&emsp;Soon the world beyond the glass dissolves to colorless shadows, like sleep, as a yawn escapes me. The fireplace keeps our ears from ringing with the gentle cracks and pops from the logs, catalyzed by Romin&apos;s  hundred-Kine pours and a whole lot of powdery, dead Essence. </p>
<p>&emsp;The Essence casts the fire in bright crimson, making the smoke smell of ozone, and when our eyes adjust to the blackness as much as they can, I can tell what Romin searches for.</p>
<p>&emsp;He stands at the window.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Veins of amethyst in the trees, huh?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s what it says in all the books. Those Chymaeran savages seem to leave everything dead in their wake. &apos;Only a single glow left to show they were ever there.&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Death might be freezing, but I think north of the capital is too cold. Even for them,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No wonder the rail lines ship out east. That&apos;s where they say the front lines are, where they&apos;ll send all the classes below us. That&apos;s where they sent my brother. He was among the top of his class, you know, like you, but he volunteered for it. Can you believe that? He said he wanted a &apos;life of adventure.&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I hope you&apos;re not looking for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, no. I was born with a far more refined taste,&quot; Romin says. &quot;There&apos;s too many things to conquer in this world beyond battles. Women. Work. Strength &mdash; you know, I&apos;m not gonna fit in my coffin when I die,&quot; he says, taking another swig from the bottle that made him gag. He squints his eyes, still trying to make out the amethyst veins. &quot;Say. The Chymaerans,&quot; he asks. &quot;Have you ever seen one of them?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Never,&quot; I say. Romin looks disappointed: all he brought was food, booze and weapons, and I&apos;m pretty sure he hoped to use all three of them. &quot;Just frozen corpses,&quot; I say. &quot;And their veins weren&apos;t purple with the Chymaeran Curse. Their bodies didn&apos;t decay to ash from it, either.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But what did them in?&quot; Romin asks, turning back to the warmth of the fire.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They were greedy with their time, taking too much, and they didn&apos;t head back early,&quot; I say. &quot;First rule is that there&apos;s always another trip.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s hands tremble as he tries to hinge his fingers, reaching closer towards the flames. &quot;What do they look like? Have you seen one? I mean, in a whole decade out here, you had to have seen something, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;d think I would. You&apos;ve heard the descriptions of them, though. Their race is tall, obsidian color, absorbing any brightness . . . like the opposite of light, hard-shelled and solid on the outside.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And they say they take the faces of their victims,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Carmine records say you can&apos;t even recognize the difference. And the longer they take your identity, the better they get at being you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I laugh. &quot;Those are Academy wives&apos; tales. The instructors tell that to scare new cadets.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s written in our history. The Carmine preserve everything the city tries to bury. We preserve all the Humans&apos; past, all that stuff the Merlot and the city try to hide. They&apos;re not a legend. They&apos;re out there, and they&apos;re very real.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;And I believe, too. While the Humans control life and heat, the Chymaera control frost and death, and I have secondhand evidence of their latter strength. It was what I witnessed as the second death of my grandfather. His first death was five years ago, when the Chymaeran Curse overtook him: the amethyst in his veins, the deterioration of his mind to the point that my father Clint wouldn&apos;t let me visit him. He wrote and scribbled for years, driven mad by the passion of a single thought. In my hands was the map he left my father and I, etched with the locations of landmarks beyond the walls. And with graduation, I know this is my last chance to reach the spot that Everett marked with a climax of circles.</p>
<p>&emsp;After several hours of listening to gale, haunting winds between pops of the smoldering logs, exhaustion outpaces our primal fears. And as the fire fades to ash and soot, we fall asleep beneath the blankets we brought on the sleds. My fingers hinge around the necklace my mother left me. Despite the cold, its black, crystalline surface is even colder.</p>
<p>&emsp;Sleep finds us quickly. We find ourselves alive and freezing the next morning: at least not cold enough to become frosthards. The last material Romin wants for his statue is ice, and the last place he wants it is forgotten with another several hundred years of history, forever lost beyond the walls. </p>
<p>&emsp;After I dress myself in the same clothes hardened with sweat from yesterday&apos;s travels, drink fresh water from melted snow, and consume half of the remaining rations I left in the corner, we release the makeshift locks and crack open the front door to blinding white.</p>
<p>&emsp;The lack of footprints sets us in an uncomfortable ease, as if amethyst veins in tree bark or the smell of ozone could sift the air when we least expect it. Romin sweats bullets as if he can use them as ammunition, still wearing a belt of two revolvers he fetched from the Carmine armory, making the dagger in my belt feel archaic. You need them. They&apos;ll get to you faster than you can reload, but if your sword and bow are steady... the instructors always said. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s roll,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Peak daylight will be gone before we know it.&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;The second day is faster when the sleds are lighter. We&apos;re almost there: all we&apos;re doing is stopping by to scavenge whatever Everett&apos;s scratchings left for us. Time passes rapidly when Romin never runs out of things to talk about.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s enough about me,&quot; he says. &quot;What do you want to know about me?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;We meander around Everett&apos;s spot for an hour, until we find a single house nestled between the hills, finding log posts that faintly mark the boundary of the small estate.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Surely this is it,&quot; I say. &quot;There isn&apos;t anything else out here.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why have a fence if nature is your only neighbor?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;We toss the leads of our sleds in the snow, preparing ourselves to enter. After trying the knob, I nod to Romin, built in just the shape to get us inside. He smirks, relishing the rare chance to helpfully break something.</p>
<p>&emsp;The door takes a full shoulder before it gives. The hinges screech from beyond a century of snow-borne rust as chips of pine wood tear from the bottom, leaving the door with jagged, gnashing teeth. It siphons the outside air as if the house has lungs to breathe, exhaling a putrid smell of age.</p>
<p>&emsp;The house&apos;s siding groans as it breathes wind into its lungs, and a single chandelier hangs from the wooden cross-beam like a tonsil. Dormant lanterns circle the chains as crystalline fragments shimmer&mdash;if Valentina was here, it would surely remind her of her lavish estate in the foothills. There are no voices outside the walls like our apartments at the Academy, but even in the silence, Romin and I feel that we are being watched.</p>
<p>&emsp;It feels as if some agent consumes all the light in the house, opposite of how light bulbs and lanterns throw their colors. Romin drags a match against the strip of the matchbox, but the box is wet, and he tries drying it off with his shirt. </p>
<p>&emsp;Impatient, I fumble around. With the ancient curtains still drawn, light struggles to filter through the fabric. But we&apos;re lucky that the horrors of this scene don&apos;t present themselves on their own.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin sputters one in sparks. He curses, and light catches a glint in the floor&mdash;is it wet? Glass? Our ancestors beyond the walls couldn&apos;t make floors out of anything other than wood. In the second breadth of darkness, my leg catches a wetness.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin drags another. It snaps. &quot;Khiras above,&quot; he curses, before taking out another.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t use the whole box, we only just got here,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Hold it sideways,&quot; expecting a whine or a punch in the shoulder. But he&apos;s too focused, an oversized toddler playing with fire.</p>
<p>&emsp;The third one lights, casting flickering shadows on the walls as if we&apos;re huddled in a cave, and neither of us are prepared for the sight. </p>
<p>&emsp;The manifestation of an ancient bloodbath comes into focus, painted across the floors as if the glass of the red paintings had shattered under pressure and spilled their contents. A paralyzing fear seizes me. My mind races. My stomach lurches. And now the putrid smell makes sense, the odor that first hit us when we entered. </p>
<p>&emsp;My eyes glance at the map, as if we found the wrong house. The bass in Romin&apos;s voice echoes, but it lacks emotion. &quot;Gods,&quot; he says. We step into the kitchen, where ancient puddles of crimson once caked the floors, kept wet by some form of moisture that condenses in the room, keeping the smell alive. The bones must have been picked apart by animal scavengers: the meat left clean like a rib roast in the dining halls after a hundred starving cadets.</p>
<p>&emsp;I throw my bag on the counter, scattering journals and notebooks and pages and artifacts&mdash;I brought everything I inherited from my grandfather. Romin passes across the carpet with a lantern. His fingers trace desperate scratches on a locked door, followed by jagged, splintered teeth around the doorknob as if someone had tried to break in, bludgeoned indentations that grew weaker and weaker further down. &quot;Fridging Chymaerans. Must have been trying to break in&mdash;the rest of the family hid in here,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;But there&apos;s no trace of Chymaeran Essence along the corpses&apos; scratches. Sylvia once told me that when Human blood and Chymaeran Essence make contact, it glows purple, then leaves a dry chalk residue. It&apos;s what the Chymaeran curse does to the blood. It&apos;s what killed Everett.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So, it wasn&apos;t a Chymaeran attack,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Then was it animals? Or . . . was it Human? </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why would Humans be out here this far? It doesn&apos;t make sense,&quot; I say. &quot;Four-day trips are unheard of.&quot; I scan Everett&apos;s documents and notebooks, and across all of them is the same insignia, the same set of strokes on the stationery my grandfather spilled his last thoughts on. Same with the map, we had been using this map for years &mdash; all the houses, all the terrain other explorers hadn&apos;t charted, beyond the walls, beyond the eyes&apos; reach of the train tracks, all the creases and folds that had been left to my grandfather&apos;s memories, and all those X&apos;es had been circling around one location, where the desperation of Everett&apos;s brainless scratchings reached a crescendo, as if all his cerebral emotions of some long-passed moment had bled in warning. </p>
<p>&emsp;This map isn&apos;t for treasure. It never was.</p>
<p>&emsp;And then the realization comes to me. I look at the tattered door. &quot;Gods . . . look at the marks,&quot; I say, and then the size of the clawed scratchings make sense. It wasn&apos;t an animal: they were handprints; tiny, bloody handprints; tiny, bloody, child-sized handprints. </p>
<p>&emsp;Romin doesn&apos;t bother trying the handle: he can&apos;t stand the thought as an impressionable mentor for the young Carmine. A hundred years dead or not, his kick bludgeons the door in a shower of splinters, and the rancid odor of death grows stronger. The room was some kind of study. The west-facing window glows in dying light as if the entire room were preserved perfectly in amber. </p>
<p>&emsp;Silence sweeps over us for several minutes as we meander about the scene, until Romin&apos;s voice severs it. Something has been bothering him. &quot;They weren&apos;t protecting themselves,&quot; he says, &quot;it just doesn&apos;t make sense. It had to have been something else.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Un-shattered glass in the study, the windows still intact, all locked in the down position&mdash;you see this door locks from the inside, and it was locked.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;If the windows are intact, they stayed in here. They didn&apos;t try to leave. The coward inside left the children out there! Why did they stay in the room? Against whatever &mdash; or whoever &mdash; was in here, why didn&apos;t they escape out the window?&quot; His fingers feel the window lock: still tight against the panes of glass, and he begins to fervently scan the study. </p>
<p>&emsp;My stomach turns with the setting sun. Anxiety begins to build. If we don&apos;t leave now, we&apos;re not getting out of here tonight. The sickness of that fills my chest with claustrophobic shadow. &quot;I&apos;m not sleeping here tonight. We don&apos;t have lumber or Essence for a fire, it&apos;s all at the storehouse. We&apos;ll freeze if we&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just hold up,&quot; Romin says, as darkness crests the horizon somewhere beyond the window. The dusk feels like a cold, viscous fluid seeping into vacant space. It feels like diving to the furthest bottom of a lake, crossing that threshold where the return is questionable, where breath is a treasured commodity. Never have I been this far out, and the paranoia of all my first fears as a Snowdrifter quickly come back to me. The sky is dark. The spaces between the trees become more indiscernible, and as the black-and-white vision in my eyes slowly takes over, anything and everything looks like an amethyst glow. I thought I had outgrown this amateur&apos;s fear, and for a second I almost think I smell ozone in the air.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;Let&apos;s go, Romin,&quot; I say, &quot;let&apos;s go, let&apos;s get out of here, it&apos;s way too late, and we&apos;re not staying here tonig&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll be fine, Titus,&quot; Romin says, &quot;we can stay here. Look.&quot; He pulls out a pouch with the Carmine crest on it, withdrawing the string, and a faint crimson glow emanates from the bag. &quot;This was only for emergency&mdash;scarce enough as it already is. The Carmine holds a small reserve the city doesn&apos;t know about.&quot; I peek. Inside is even more dead Essence, ten times as combustible as gunpowder, enough to last us a hundred nights or blow the house and everything in eyeshot to the sky.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Fine,&quot; I say, trying to mask the tremor in my voice. Whatever gets us the best haul is all that matters. All I can think of is my sister Ellie, my duty to protect her and raise her, and it terrifies me to think of a world where she lives without me.</p>
<p>&emsp;As Romin stokes the fireplace, all I can think of were the last words I exchanged with Ellie, the bitterness of that last moment. There is no nature to hear beyond the walls of the house; all that meets us is tinnitus. It feels as if we float in nonexistence, in a vacuous sheet of null space lined with trees. It&apos;s as if time doesn&apos;t exist here; a place where news and sound of the industry doesn&apos;t travel; where the smell of sickening smoke doesn&apos;t reach; the only proof of continuity of nature in the migration of the two moons and a blanket of stars above us.</p>

<p>&emsp;The dying fire we lit off of Romin&apos;s Essence crackles like dry leaves, popping and sputtering as it succumbs to the cold. Romin snores in short starts and stops, too patternless to be anything close to white noise, but it doesn&apos;t matter.</p>
<p>&emsp;I won&apos;t sleep tonight, anyways. Once I get over the fear of our distance, surrounded by a scene of carnage without Romin&apos;s witticisms to make me forget, my thoughts bottom out into the guilt I brought with me, riding the residual anguish of our last exchange. I pray to the Gods that one day she&apos;ll understand that I never meant to hurt her; that she&apos;ll see how hard I fight for her, even if I&apos;m not around to explain.</p>

<p>&emsp;It was the morning before we left: the last errand before Romin and I met at my father&apos;s shop.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Look, look,&quot; Ellie said, &quot;Look, did you see? There&apos;s letters on the walls.&quot; She tensioned her frozen fingers between my hands, dragging me from the footpath.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Those are names,&quot; I said. &quot;People put their names there before they leave to protect our city. They etch them in there.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But why?&quot; my sister asked.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re stalling,&quot; I said. &quot;You have to get to school, so let&apos;s&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just tell me!&quot; she shouts, standing still as cardstock. &quot;Just tell me, Tie.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I checked my watch. Every morning was a rush when our father slept at his shop. But I was thankful &mdash; those mornings, the smell of alcohol on his breath was enough to make my sister uncomfortable. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They put them there to be remembered. It&apos;s really dangerous out there, you know. It&apos;s cold. It&apos;s colder than it is along the outer city walls. &quot; She traced her fingers along the indentations of a stone marked CHESTER COLEMAN. The date read a hundred years ago. &quot;This one was one of the first. In fact, it was almost a hundred years ago our city started doing this, after the fall of the capital city.&quot; Snow saturated the sharp contours of the carving, leaving the name nearly lost to time. I looked up to the top of the walls: the furthest boulders so small they appeared like grains of sand, still etched with names as far as I could see, and only several hundred were marked with the triumphant &apos;X&apos; that denoted a cadet&apos;s return. I prayed to the Gods the survivors had just forgotten to mark them. After I passed the Outer Gates, would any eyes ever read my name upon the wall?</p>
<p>&emsp;Ellie caught me lost in thought again &mdash; she is good at it. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s go. We can&apos;t be late like yesterday,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I&apos;m not stalling,&quot; Ellie said, tensioning her grasp further. &quot;I just want to be with you for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know, I know. But I&apos;ll&mdash;&quot; pick you up after? Careful. &quot;I&apos;ll see you in a few days,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;A few days?&quot; she asked. &quot;That&apos;s so long!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I have to go beyond the walls again. Dad needs more goods for the rummage store. More antiques to sell. He&apos;s got buyers lined up, so we need fresh stock.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Boo,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s okay, though. Valentina&apos;s drivers will be here after Seminary to pick you up.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s not! Why doesn&apos;t Daddy pick me up? I haven&apos;t seen him in days,&quot; she said. &quot;He&apos;s worse than Mom, and Mom is still away.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Her words stick like shrapnel. Clint seems to find his only comfort in the portrait behind the counter: the metallic corners worn to fillets from his fingers. His same grasp holds the store as it sifts like sand through his fingers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He won&apos;t be back tonight. But I&apos;ll be back soon. I promise. Then we can do something fun.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But why?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s for our future, and your future. And your education,&quot; I say, but Ellie&apos;s hands balled into fists, straining her skin as her nails bit into her flesh. &quot;I promise. I&apos;m really trying&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not fair!&quot; she says, stamping her feet. &quot;Why can&apos;t you be here? Why does everyone leave me? Why does everyone hate me?&quot; The emptiness in her gaze stretched on with a thousand-yard stare: not into my eyes, but through me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I hoped my warmth would suffice for reason. &quot;I love you, Ellie,&quot; I say. &quot;I love you more than anything. But there&apos;s someone in every family who has to fight for it.&quot; I held the back of her head to my shoulder like our mother once did to me. </p>
<p>&emsp;But she resisted the warmth of my embrace. Her arms dangled in protest. Not seeing her mother or father probably made her wonder if she was ever born at all. And as an adoptee from the orphanage, I knew exactly how that felt.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I love you,&quot; I told her. &quot;I promise I&apos;ll come back soon.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You always do this, Tie.&quot; She twisted from my grasp. &quot;I hate this life here. Daddy says I can live somewhere else, but you won&apos;t let me. I hate you! Why can&apos;t you just let me go?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She disappeared into the Seminary doors before I could call out to her, her tiny hands clasped around the lunch I packed for her. I hoped she read the note I left in there, every day reminding her how much I loved her &mdash; even if it did nothing, it was the persistence that was worth it. All I could think of was how much I wished I could leave more. Or something more permanent &mdash; something that would stay with her. How will she remember me?</p>

<p>&emsp;My mind is restless. I have to keep moving, I have to do something. I can&apos;t sleep on the carpet stained with blood, so I scrounge around. A golden corner protrudes from the bag that Romin strapped around his shoulders, and I pull the item out to satiate my ravenous curiosity.</p>
<p>&emsp;I wrap myself in two blankets before I crack the spine of the book. The darkness makes it difficult to discern the black font from the vellum. I light a candle, primed with a pinch of Romin&apos;s Essence, and it throws crimson light on the walls of the foyer, illuminating the pages.</p>
<p>&emsp;Before I could read, I looked upon Everett&apos;s books in his library in awe of their black-ink artistry&mdash;scribed in forbidden ink. The weathered pages made me wonder their age, and Everett told me they recorded the world before the Fall of Nordhaven, before the moment that the Chymaeran extremists liquidated our capital city, killing the original royal family and forcing us to retreat to the city of Blackwater.</p>
<p>&emsp;This book is so similar. Illustrations of a feline race called the Ahkvas line the pages: drawings of landscapes with plants so tall you can&apos;t see the sky from the ground, and another race of creatures with wings, another like plants, and so many others I can&apos;t distinguish. Fine-gritted rocks stretch over endless landscapes in places so dry they don&apos;t get any water. There are bodies of water filled with salt that stretch so far you can&apos;t see the end of them&mdash;to imagine salt as something so common!</p>
<p>&emsp;But it&apos;s towards the end that the illustrations surprise me. The chapter reads AND NOW, THE GREAT CITY OF BLACKWATER. </p>
<p>&emsp;The illustrations are indiscernible. Luscious landscapes stretch just beyond the city. Vines cascade from the city walls: I recognize them as the center walls, the original bounds of the city before the Fall forced our people to expand. And in the center are the great peaks of The Afterlife: shrouded in clouds, in great mystery to anyone living below them. After all, the only contact to those Acolytes who connect with the Gods are the Merlot, Valentina&apos;s folk; the city&apos;s active government officials who carry out Their commands and distribute Their gifts.</p>
<p>&emsp;At first, I think I see the Chymaerans attacking the Humans in the following pages. But I&apos;m wrong. They&apos;re tending fields together. They&apos;re working in cooperation with the Humans. Captions read THE UNION OF LIFE AND DEATH and BLACKWATER: UNION IN DICHOTOMY.</p>
<p>&emsp;I wish such stories survived to stir the souls of our citizens, not burned en-masse in the great book burnings. The Merlot tell us of the strength in severing ourselves from that past, making ourselves stronger, raising our children to fight and defend the last foothold of the Humans so the Chymaera can&apos;t extinguish our people and our light. They tell us there is no space for fairy tales &mdash; that they distract us from true purpose, from the calling to forge a new golden age for our people.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s snore pulls me back to the present moment. The Essence we lined in all the candles runs low, and I pray the heat will last us the rest of the night. I think of Ellie and Sylvia. I imagine their disheartened faces if I failed to return.</p>
<p>&emsp;My eyes grow heavy as my fingers reach to close the book. It catches itself on the last page of an inscription addressed in ink. To Ullrich, Evella, young Fletcher and Lyra: the next golden age lies in our blood.</p>
<p>&emsp;With love, Everett.</p>

<p>&emsp;Romin awakens to find the house torn apart even further.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I should have known that map wasn&apos;t for treasure,&quot; I say, my skin pallid from a sleepless night without warmth. I breathe between my palms. &quot;Did you read the inscription on the book you found?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, I just liked the pictures,&quot; Romin says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I snort. &quot;You oversized toddler.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;My father and I thought Everett&apos;s map charted the houses and landmarks he found. But this wasn&apos;t any stranger&apos;s house.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because that book you found was inside this house,&quot; I say. &quot;And it was addressed by my grandfather himself.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So?&quot; He asks.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;So this was his house! Or he knew the people here, a long, long time ago. I&apos;ve been looking all morning for more clues. I tore through bookshelf after bookshelf, looking for notes, photographs, anything . . . but it&apos;s almost as if this whole house was already cased. It just feels like things are conveniently missing.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin is smart with this stuff: if being a Snowdrifter is my world, this is entirely his. &quot;I work repossessions with Carmine business. Nobody hides anything from us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Doesn&apos;t everything feel like it&apos;s already been combed through?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin says, &quot;It does. Low-value items laid out&mdash;you see, to hide their things, they&apos;d arrange their house so neatly you&apos;d think they weren&apos;t hiding anything at all. That&apos;s why my suspicion&mdash;&quot; he says, tracing the corner of the wall again until he returns to the office, feeling for frayed carpet fibers and shifting his weight to feel the wooden planks beneath the surface.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s absurd why anybody would hide something valuable in a house like this,&quot; I say. &quot;This far from the walls? Wouldn&apos;t it be better guarded in a castle or a grand estate?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;d be surprised,&quot; he says. &quot;Most houses built before the Fall of Nordhaven, stone ones like this, had hollow floor spaces. And in a room like the office...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The carpet folds backwards in the corner. Beyond our lanterns, first light catches a reflection off the rectangular lid of an aluminum tin.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is that?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;Not sure yet.&quot; Romin&apos;s fingers fondle for an edge until he lifts it from the hollowed crevice. It looks like a munitions box, but a lot heavier: the walls so thick it surely wasn&apos;t stamped out of sheets of steel. </p>
<p>&emsp;After assessing the weight of the thing inside it, he triumphantly hands it to me. &quot;That might be a free month with your sister,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I shake it. Something heavy clangs inside, giving off a curious energy that stands my hairs on end, and I mutter words of disbelief.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Valentina calls my line of work criminal. But I&apos;m glad at least someone can appreciate it,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope it pays back for the night here.&quot; Without the Essence in his bag, there&apos;s no chance we could have made it.</p>
<p>&emsp;The metal box emits an energy stronger than his bag of Essence. We hastily gather our things and leave as soon as we can.</p>

<p>&emsp;No grand welcome awaits us as we enter the walls two days later, early that morning, exhausted. I foolishly wonder if my father or Ellie are worried about me, concerned I made it back a day late. Romin parts for the Carmine compound. I crack open the front door of the shop, unloading belongings, but my father Clint isn&apos;t inside. He knows our protocol &mdash; is he contacting the emergency patrol? Is he putting in a notice about my disappearance, or worse, did he go looking for me? I let the thoughts flood my mind before I remember what I&apos;ve always been to him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, Titus,&quot; Clint says. &quot;Took you damn long enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;He motions to come in from the cold, more interested in the haul than anything else. The temperature climbs a near thirty degrees compared to the freezing conditions outside. Sweat soaks the front of his thin, white shirt in an upside-down triangle, where dirt from his face wiped across the fabric, and it almost feels like an Academy gym from all the humidity.</p>
<p>&emsp;The smell of stuffiness makes me wonder which habit of his caused it&mdash;depends on whether the back door is locked or unlocked. But the bruise on his neck makes me hope I&apos;m not getting another sibling.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So what&apos;dya find out there?&quot; he asks, wiping the sweat from his forehead, tussling his jet-black beard. He hasn&apos;t bathed in a couple days. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Were you concerned? At all?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&emsp;He looks puzzled. &quot;It&apos;s only been two days since you left, hasn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Four. It&apos;s been four days,&quot; I say, &quot;four days I was out there, and Romin and I didn&apos;t even know if we were going to make it back.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;We share a moment of silence before he says, &quot;Oh.&quot; Not an apology, and he&apos;s not impressed, either, just a mumble before he makes his way to the sled, sorting through the trinkets. In that time, my anger builds like the bottom of an hourglass filling with saltpeter, and I know whatever he does next will set me off.</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint spreads the items on the wooden shop floor: old metal signs; porcelain furnishings wrapped in blankets; the highest-value items I&apos;ve learned through years of being a Snowdrifter.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not a bad haul. But not great, either,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;Stunned, although I should have known better, I respond, &quot;Not great! Not great?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He shrugs.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;After the lengths I went to?&quot; I add. &quot;Do you even understand?&quot; It takes all my restraint not to bash in that salt-and-pepper scarred face of his, but I hold myself back. I feel the desire to set him off, just as he frustrated me&mdash;as if it were a game of points. &quot;Ellie. Did you see her at all while I was gone?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m trying to focus, son. Not now,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Your daughter?&quot; The words slip out. &quot;Has she seen you even once this week? This month?&quot; And I can feel his anger build, too.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No. No I haven&apos;t. I&apos;ve been busy,&quot; he says, and I can hear his words crumble like the weak man that he is.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Too busy to care for her.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, that busy,&quot; Clint says, &quot;trying to keep this family afloat.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And you call this a family,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And you call your writing flowery essays at the Academy hard. You don&apos;t know the first thing about real work.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And it&apos;s not like you know the first thing about letting go.&quot; The next words slip out. &quot;Of this shithole and moving on. Try thinking about someone other than yourself or your dead wife for once!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;They&apos;re the same words he&apos;s heard before. When you argue with someone for so long, when confrontation becomes a part of your daily routine, uncrossable boundaries dissolve and there&apos;s no tape left. When the message doesn&apos;t get across, you go further, and further, until no holds are barred, and irreversible damage singes the bridges that hold together any love you might have felt. There was a day I looked at him and realized he wasn&apos;t my father anymore, just a shell of a man that once carried me on his shoulders, loved his daughter, and kissed his wife. </p>
<p>&emsp;He&apos;s not that man anymore. And he hasn&apos;t been for a long time.</p>
<p>&emsp;He drops the granite statuettes Romin found on the dining room table. They snap, and he snaps, balling his fists in tensioned knots as if emotion can replace logic. &quot;My dead wife. Your mother, you piece of shit,&quot; he says. &quot;You don&apos;t know the first thing about being in love, you pathetic virgin. Too much of a coward to let in anyone like I loved Emilia!&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s disgusting how people use your own sensitive disclosures against you. I feel my soul tighten further in my chest, walls of ice freezing further as my feelings of sadness transmute into unbridled rage.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;And the worst thing is&mdash;you&apos;ll never know how it feels.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And that&apos;s the sacrifice I have to make,&quot; I tell him. &quot;to raise Ellie, your daughter, as a better caretaker than your despair would ever allow you. It&apos;s called sacrifice, and you should&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He takes a swing at me. If it were ten years earlier, and we were ten years younger, he&apos;d have the strength on me to knock me down. His frail arms atrophy from years without exercise; depression and unsettled anger consuming much of his appetite. All he does is suck out of the bottle. Years later, and all it does is suck out of him. </p>
<p>&emsp;A second swing surprises me. He hits me square in the chest, but I hardly lose two steps. I have so much anger for him, but the frailer and older he gets, I find my fists can never tension as hard as they should.</p>
<p>&emsp;Combat school made me reflexive, though, and I fight the instinct to drive a fist in his face. So I punch him in the chest, driving him backwards, not enough to hurt him, but just to leave a bruise. He falls on his back. Two store shelves topple over, their contents scattered across the floor: random Snowdrifter finds and pawned items we&apos;ve accumulated over a near decade. Only a single punch and he&apos;s unable to lift himself.</p>
<p>&emsp;I come to realize the disappointment that really triggered this. As he bows his head, gasping for breath, I approach him, using everything I have inside me to lower my voice.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I just . . . I just wanted you to be there, Dad,&quot; I tell him. I extend a hand, but he refuses. His knees crack as he lifts himself up. I bend down to pick up the pieces, but he stops me.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s handle this another time, son,&quot; he says. &quot;I just, I don&apos;t know, just . . . sometimes the thoughts are so loud I can&apos;t . . .&quot; he trails off. It&apos;s his &apos;I&apos;m sorry&apos;, I guess.</p>
<p>&emsp;The sleds rest in the corner, still full of items, and we won&apos;t be getting to them tonight&mdash;because we both need time to cool off. My fingers trace my jet-black beard and dry lips in idle action, uncertain what words to respond with.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And the papers&mdash;&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint. Don&apos;t,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just hear me out, Titus,&quot; he responds, serious enough to use my name. &quot;Nether of us can take care of her the way she deserves. You&apos;re right that I can&apos;t. But you have to realize that you can&apos;t either.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;A rare sight of guilt crests his eyes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I have the Academy stipend. She can live in the house we grew up in. I fought so hard for this. And I&apos;ll give whatever it takes to provide her with that,&quot; I say, &quot;even if it means everything I have.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But all we can give her is just the afterimage. Those days are over. Forever,&quot; he says, but I refuse to believe that.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She just can&apos;t see the full picture yet,&quot; I say. &quot;She&apos;s just too young. If she could only know how much I &mdash;&quot; and then I pause &mdash; &quot;how much &apos;we&apos; give for her . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;But Clint insists. &quot;Let the papers go through. She needs a family that can love her. She needs a full family.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All she needs is me,&quot; I tell him. &quot;She needs us. I might not be her blood, but I can love her. The way that Mom loved me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He hesitates. The words catch in the back of his throat before he finds a way to let them out. &quot;Just do it. For her,&quot; Clint says, and his words trail off. It&apos;s the sound of an impasse, and I know he&apos;ll never accept the value of my efforts.And if he doesn&apos;t have time to appreciate my achievements, to celebrate my efforts, I don&apos;t have a time for another day of us sorting through shit and arguing. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s just get this over with,&quot; I say. &quot;We won&apos;t want to be here any more tomorrow or the next day.&quot; I&apos;d rather be spending this last break with family like everybody else, I think, before I realize where I am, who I am, and who I&apos;m talking to.</p>

<p>&emsp;Two-and-a-half hours pass before we make it to the end. Clint&apos;s not too impressed &mdash; mostly the same stuff that&apos;s been rotting on the shelves for years, but there truly wasn&apos;t anything else out there. Forbidden literature&apos;s much harder to sell than it was a year ago, and after so many close calls with undercover customers from the Ministry Of Truth, we stopped selling them altogether.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s this?&quot; Clint asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Some kind of necklace,&quot; I say, &quot;has some strange glow to it.&quot; If it&apos;s Essenced, it will be much harder to sell &mdash; items channeling Essence are forbidden by law. But they also fetch a significantly higher price.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; he mutters. He draws his glasses from his pocket, peering through the single frame that still holds a lens. &quot;It&apos;s Carmine in origin.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin&apos;s folk,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;He squints his eyes as he tries to discern the etchings. &quot;They wear necklaces just like this, get &apos;em when they cross initiation. Everett was one of them. Probably a million of these around the capital, worn by most all their members, though it&apos;s strange to find one like this &mdash; this must have been a really old one. Where did you find it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;At the spot. Everett&apos;s spot,&quot; I say. His expression shifts with a curious energy, putting an end of his glasses between his front teeth.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You finally made it there,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought we&apos;d never find out what was in there. You could have told me to start.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I did tell you!&quot; I say. &quot;Before I left, Clint.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Whatever,&quot; he grunts. &quot;Just give me the box. It&apos;s the only good find out of this whole bunch.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I hold it a bit longer just to piss him off.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus. Now,&quot; he says, ripping the box from my hands. A jagged metal edge catches my hand, splitting the skin in a fine cut.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ah&mdash;Gods, Clint, can you be any more patient?&quot; I say. A line of crimson appears on my finger, staining the jagged, pearlescent metal.</p>
<p>&emsp;He curses the names of the Gods as if he&apos;s the one hurt. &quot;Khiras and Evella, your idiot friend couldn&apos;t wait to open it &apos;till we brought it here. It&apos;s not my fault. Was he bashed in the head too many times during training?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, he&apos;s not an idiot,&quot; I say, &quot;you just have to be careful.&quot; I draw my hand into the box, curious to hold what&apos;s inside.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Like hell I do, son, if you could just control your stupid friends and&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, piss off,&quot; I say, watching a drip of my blood travel down the necklace. &quot;At least I can control Ellie. My sister. Your daughter. Remember?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, do you remember who makes the money around here? Does you swingin&apos; a sword around at the Academy make things best for us?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I make more money than you do. I bring the stuff that you sell. And at least it makes our family something: something better than a father who can&apos;t get rid of his wife&apos;s shop. For the best. For us. For Ellie.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You son of a bitch,&quot; he spits.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She wasn&apos;t a bitch,&quot; I say. &quot;You treat her memory like she was.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I oughtta&mdash;&quot; Clint says, but then my blood drips down the silver strands and absorbs itself in the center pendant. A sudden flash blinds our eyes: the brightest red leaving a neon in our retinas, and I hear the half-log benches collapse against the ground as we both fall backwards. An aisle of goods crashes to the floor when Clint bashes his head against it. A bright beam of crimson floods from the necklace like a pillar of fire, crashing against the pointed ceiling like a reverse waterfall, filling its volume in an inverted lake of Essenced plasma, and I can hardly see its glowing miasma since both of my eyes are blinded.</p>
<p>&emsp;It feels as if some agent tries to flood my circuits completely. But in its place, an excruciating sensation burns my right wrist, right where my threaded scar is. </p>
<p>&emsp;The glow radiates out the windows.I shield my eyes as a sudden surge of energy saturates my circuits. I roll across the floor to take refuge behind an aisle of dried goods.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Dad!&quot; I shout. &quot;Dad, are you okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Son,&quot; he says, &quot;Son, are you alright?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I crawl towards his voice. The luminous glow tapers away, and eventually I feel the collar of his shirt.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Da&mdash;Clint,&quot; I say, &quot;your head.&quot; He&apos;s bleeding from another slice across his forehead. I lift him from the ground though my eyes can&apos;t yet adjust to the darkness&mdash;he must have clipped the edge of the metal shelves.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s alright, son, I&apos;ve got bandages in the back,&quot; he says. &quot;Where&apos;s that girlfriend of yours with the medical know-how? Sylvia?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not the time,&quot; I say. &quot;How hard did you hit, er&mdash; what day is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Like I&apos;d know that,&quot; he says. &quot;A workday. Just like yesterday. The day before that, the day before that&mdash;&quot; he points to the calendar on the wall, at least twelve days behind on tearing off the dates.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s my name?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re my son, how&apos;d I forget that, you loon,&quot; he says, &quot;I named you. Titus Nathaniel Berguard. Couldn&apos;t have come up with anything better.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And where do you live?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;At our house, just down the street.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You haven&apos;t been there in months,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I guess I live here then,&quot; he says, with a dry, heaving cough to follow. &quot;You gonna lift me up?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I won&apos;t be living here for long,&quot; Clint says. &quot;Your grandfather left us that warehouse of his. We sell that place, we&apos;ll be able to keep this shop open forever.&quot; But he says that every time. It was just a &apos;month or so&apos; a year ago. And it was just a &apos;year or so&apos; two years ago. There&apos;s an emptiness in his eyes when he looks at the picture of Emilia on the wall. And how else can I tell his &quot;habits&quot; from earlier? Because I always find a sheet covering the portrait when he&apos;s in the back-room with a &apos;client&apos; that&apos;s looking to &apos;sample the high-value merchandise,&apos; as if her eyes silently judge him from behind the frame.</p>
<p>&emsp;I try for a certain sincerity, but my voice wavers. &quot;Dad, we can&apos;t keep doing this. Please. We have to move on,&quot; I say. </p>
<p>&emsp;He&apos;s heard my reply countless times before, and I&apos;ve heard his response that many times, too, so instead, he ducks his head. &quot;You know, Tie, your mother...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Opened this shop with you, I know,&quot; then I add, &quot;Dad. But she wants us to succeed and move on. To do whatever it takes for her children and husband to thrive.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She wouldn&apos;t want us to sell this place,&quot; he says. &quot;I know I don&apos;t want to, son. You know I was gonna pass this down to you, and you&apos;d run this business hard, and hustle, after your service with the Academy and you survive, and we&apos;ll run this shop together, you and me, and Ellie can help us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just trying to do my best,&quot; I say. My glance dips towards my feet, toes tracing the hardwood floors I crawled on as a child. I find it hard to meet his eyes, and I can tell he has a hard time meeting mine, too. The shop groans from years of eternal winter: the only sound that fills the distance between us. That, and my heart racing at the realization of what the Essenced burst might mean. I can only imagine the punishment that awaits us if Merlot sympathizers, or the city guard, had seen it.</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint says, &quot;So why don&apos;t you go check on Elizabeth at our . . . er, the house, and&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But the Essence! Someone had to have seen that. The city guards, do you know what they&apos;ll do to us? You know what happens to the heretics&mdash;those people who use Essence for anything else.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re fine, Titus,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll be hanged, or thrown in prison on a twenty-year sentence. Or worse, we&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Quit being a pussy and take care of your sister, Titus,&quot; Clint says. &quot;We&apos;ll be fine. Nobody saw it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;And our conversation ends like that. No question of how I am, of the adventure I went on, if I survived, if the mortal coil is still in my body. I&apos;m a convenient tool to him as his son. And the only thing that connects me to him is that he legally receives the stipend from my work in the Academy. If he drops this pathetic shop, we&apos;ll have a chance at something &mdash; anything &mdash; else, but he&apos;s too stubborn and resilient to see a sunken cost when it&apos;s in front of him.</p>

<p>&emsp;The sanctuary bells sound the transition to Darktime when I reach the porch of my childhood home. Pedestrians stop in the streets. My neighbors step out of their homes, ushering their children outside as Ellie exits the front door.</p>
<p>&emsp;Despite the resentment still branded on her face, she succumbs to a longing that leans her into me. Her shoulder presses against my waist, and I wrap my arm around her, giving her a side-hug before we raise our hands and voices for the Rite Of Benediction.</p>
<p>&emsp;It takes mere seconds before disparate voices attenuate to the words of a single body: omnipresent like the eyes of the Gods that watch their severed children.</p>
<p>&emsp;Bright is the light of the Acolytes&apos; passion</p>
<p>&emsp;Plight is the rite unto thee</p>
<p>&emsp;Smite with a spite the blight of the Nightmen</p>
<p>&emsp;Tomorrow is beholden to me</p>
<p>&emsp;Fight for your life, set fire to flames</p>
<p>&emsp;And the Firebrands furrow a way</p>
<p>&emsp;Find the old Light &apos;fore the sin of the Fall</p>
<p>&emsp;And reclaim what was taken from me</p>
<p>&emsp;Set upon your shoulders the remorseful millstone</p>
<p>&emsp;And toil &apos;till Essence is dry</p>
<p>&emsp;The Golden Age waits where the weakness is gone</p>
<p>&emsp;And the dream will live after I die</p>
<p>&emsp;Bright is the light of the Acolytes&apos; passion</p>
<p>&emsp;Plight is the rite unto thee</p>
<p>&emsp;Right is the fight for Humanity&apos;s cause</p>
<p>&emsp;Tomorrow is beholden to me</p>
<p>&emsp;The last sung syllable dissolves to silence, and in the space that remains, the entire city is left to reflect on what our ancestors left behind. Ellie disappears inside before I can catch the door, captured by the excitement of coloring her pictures. Her flaxen hair spills from her head in strands of golden fiber as she sprawls across the kitchen floor. It sways with every stroke of the death-gripped purple crayon tightened in her fist, scrawling away on stray sheets she took from Seminary.</p>
<p>&emsp;My sister hums the tune of the Benediction since she doesn&apos;t yet remember the words. The wind slams the door behind me as I remove my thick coat. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What happened to a &apos;hello?&apos;&quot; I ask, twisting off my gloves and deposititing them on the holds of the rack.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;&apos;Hello?&apos;  You didn&apos;t &apos;hello&apos; me in days,&quot; Ellie says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s fair,&quot; I mutter. &quot;But did Father come by?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No.&quot; She kicks her feet behind her, unfazed by the thought.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I&apos;m sorry that I was gone for an extra day. We got held up beyond the walls. We had to spend a night two days away from the city, can you believe that?&quot; I ask, expecting the smallest sliver of interest, but all she manages is a grunt. </p>
<p>&emsp;When I approach, I notice it&apos;s one of her worksheets from Seminary. They&apos;re learning about the spiritual armor of the Firebrand. </p>
<p>&emsp;Putting aside her avid disinterest, I ask about her artistic vision. Purple, huh? I don&apos;t think any of the Firebrands I know are allowed to wear purple. It&apos;s different shades of red, with a little bit of yellow.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Her eyes focus harder. &quot;But mine will be purple,&quot; she states. &quot;It&apos;s the best color.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The color of the Chymaera? Of the enemy?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;My favorite color,&quot; she insists. &quot;Red and blue together. Blue like the sky should be, and red like everything else.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Like what?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Like the clothes the older kids wear. Like your cheeks and nose when you walk inside. Like blood. Like Essence, when it dries.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then maybe you can convince the Grandmaster General to change our wardrobe. He wouldn&apos;t listen to me, and I was the top student in our school.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m the best in my class, they say,&quot; Ellie says. I think to myself that it&apos;s a miracle that she&apos;s so self-sufficient: far more than any kid her age should ever be forced to be. Forced like I was, even before her age.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;m so proud of you,&quot; I tell her. But when I take a closer look at her homework, I notice all the written parts aren&apos;t filled out. &quot;You know you&apos;re supposed to write what each of the armor pieces mean first, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I hate that part!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;If you hate words, you won&apos;t be able to speak,&quot; I tell her. I drag the pint-sized wooden chair in from the playroom, etched with the name TITUS NATHANIEL BERGUARD from when I was a toddler. When it gets me to her level, I lean forward, afraid my full weight could shear the legs straight off.</p>
<p>&emsp;Ellie sneezes. The house is covered in dust, and I can&apos;t remember the last time I cleaned it. It&apos;s what I hired the caretakers for: once every two weeks.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;How about we do it together?&quot; I offer, for the third time this week.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No. I&apos;m too tired,&quot; she says. &quot; I feel sick.&quot; And then her sniffles make sense: maybe it&apos;s not just allergies after all.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you have Seminary in the morning, so it needs to be done,&quot; I say. She glares at me as I go in her backpack: the planner I bought for her has several unchecked boxes, along with the rest of the Firebrand&apos;s Armor sheets scrunched and stuffed like packing paper. &quot;Ellie, this is due tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know, but I don&apos;t want to!&quot; she shouts.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;If you did some of this yesterday, you wouldn&apos;t have had to do them all tonight,&quot; I say. &quot;Come on.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I snatch the drawing from the floor. With her face screwed up, she stands to stams her feet in protest. &quot;But Carrie never help me last night!&quot; The tutor. &quot;She never came.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You can have this back after you finish the first one,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No! No, no, no, no,&quot; she says, her amethyst eyes glowing with a familiar anger.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, yes, yes. This is important,&quot; I tell her. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why can&apos;t I be a pitcher-drawer like Sylvia?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sylvia does that on the side. She&apos;s smart to start.&quot; I un-crumple the assignment and place it on the kitchen counter, but she swats it away.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;I wish Gran-pa Ev was here. He&apos;s nice to me,&quot; Ellie says. &quot;Not you. He let me eat sweets! And he let me stay up late.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That was years ago,&quot; I tell her. &quot;You didn&apos;t have school yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well I hate it,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I rest my head in my hands, turning away from her icy glare to address the ghost of my mother. &quot;I&apos;m just trying to do my best,&quot; I mutter.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I hate you,&quot; she adds. &quot;I don&apos;t want to, and you should do it for me again.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then we&apos;ll do it together,&quot; I say, glancing at my watch, wondering if I&apos;ll have to sleep on the couch again.</p>
<p>&emsp;She takes a beat in anger before the exhaustion on my face gets through to her. &quot;Fine, then,&quot; she says, dragging a chair to my side of the kitchen table, making sure it screeches across every inch of the floor.</p>
<p>&emsp;It takes us a mere two minutesto write the first one, and she doesn&apos;t even need my help. Watching the candlelight flicker on her face reminds me of her mother in the smallest nuances of the creases in her face, and I find it fills me with a certain warmth.</p>
<p>&emsp;She starts the second crumpled sheet.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what is this one?&quot; I point to the purple picture on the page.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The helmet of faith,&quot; Ellie says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what does it do?  Write in the box,&quot; I tell her, as she scribes the first three words.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;To trust the Alakytes to get us things to live,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. The Acolytes,&quot; I say, pointing to the mispelled word a seminarian shouldn&apos;t have to know yet. &quot;And that &mdash; what&apos;s that below it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The belt of burden,&quot; she says. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what does it do?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It holds up the pants.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;The line hits where the exhaustion weakens me the most. I laugh and laugh, until Ellie&apos;s offense eventually boils over into laughter.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it holds up the pants!&quot; She insists, gesturing an imaginary pair of pants, chuckling as she tries to straighten her face.</p>
<p>&emsp;I ask, &quot;The pants? And  . . . and what would the pants do, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The pants of, uh . . . pants of patience.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Patience?&quot; I run her creative mind further. &quot;Patience for what?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Uh, patience for when you gotta go pee or poo, to not take them off,&quot; she says. &quot;Because you can&apos;t do it in the store, or in the street, you have to wait.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel the tears crest my eyes as she begins to write it down. &quot;Stop, stop,&quot; I say. She laughs again, and I&apos;m unsure whether she&apos;s developed an intentional sense of humor yet.</p>
<p>&emsp;She asks, &quot;What do the pants do, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There are no pants,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;She gestures to my trousers. &quot;You wear the Fire pants.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, I have pants. But the armor is a metaphor,&quot; I tell her. &quot;It means something symbolic. It makes you remember certain things when you think about it, the stuff that&apos;s good for us to remember.&quot; Her mind spins over the thought as she stares at my pants, piecing together what I mean. &quot;Like the thing we just said &mdash; the Benediction &mdash; before Lighttime becomes Darktime.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh,&quot; she says. The pen idles on the page, scrawling circles in the corner. &quot;So the belt isn&apos;t actually a belt,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sort of. But it&apos;s what it means that we care about,&quot; I tell her. &quot;So what does it mean to us? What do we carry?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The badness, of how we lost our gift. We can&apos;t do what the Gods said we could do, with fire and life. But not the people on the big mountain, up there getting us food and stuff we need.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Close enough,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But why, though?&quot; She asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why what?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All the badness of the scaredy people that used their Essence to run away: why is their bad on us now? We didn&apos;t do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because we are the last Humans left. We are the only ones that can make good on all that &apos;badness&apos; and make our people better.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She pauses for a moment. &quot;I think Dad is one of the bad ones,&quot; she says. &quot;He runs like them. But like the belt is not a belt, he&apos;s not running. Just scared, like, running without moving,&quot; Ellie says.</p>
<p>&emsp;My heart sinks a little as she wraps up the last words of her worksheet. There&apos;s so little I can offer, so I say: &quot;Dad would be really sad if he heard you say that.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But he should be here more,&quot; she says. &quot;Not the nanny. And you should be here!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I am here.&quot; I can feel the temperature rise, loathing how circumstance rhymes across generations. &quot;I come here every day I can. I pay for the house to try to let you live somewhere nice.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Houses are only nice when people are in them,&quot; she says, and though it tears at me, the only response I have is to do what my father never could.</p>
<p>&emsp;I wrap my arms around her, relishing in her warmth, thankful for the space she takes up, and I enjoy the weight of her as I lift her into the air. But she rests her arms at her side, without a hug in response.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why didn&apos;t you let them take me?&quot; She asks, and the question startles me. She&apos;s talking about the papers Clint told me to sign. The day before graduation, he forced me into a meeting with Child Services &mdash; and maybe I&apos;m fortunate they don&apos;t care about their jobs, because I care for her more than anyone else can. </p>
<p>&emsp;It fills me with a certain guilt every time I see the crescents in her eyes, the dirt on her skin, but what&apos;s stronger is the anger I have for the carelessness of my father.</p>
<p>&emsp; &quot;Because you&apos;re mine. And because you deserve better.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;Better than being alone and unwanted like I was, in the orphanage. Better with someone loving you sincerely. Regardless of the fact that they lined up some infertile rich family in Province Eight to take care of her like their own.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I love you so much,&quot; I tell her, but I can feel the disappointment in the way she slumps with dead weight.</p>

<p>&emsp;I head for my apartment. It&apos;s way too late to watch the sun touch the horizon, to soak in even the smallest sensation of warmth through the smog. There is hardly night or day in Blackwater. Most of the time it&apos;s dark, though the sun never sets. It just hangs in the sky, sometimes dipping for moments below the mountains. All we have is Lighttime and Darktime, driven by the man-made cycle of electric light on a schedule. </p>
<p>&emsp;The lower city is sleepless as it always is, the generator workers encrusted with soot and sweat as they emerge from the power plants, trading shifts with others whose schedules never afford them the Lighttime: to me, it&apos;s been motivation to do better in the Academy, a reminder of what happens if I don&apos;t maintain my echelon among the top ranks. Too many cadets fail to return from battle as it is already &mdash; while the top classes are promised the highest ranks in the service, the lowest cadets are first fodder for the front lines. And if they do survive, their dreadful, dragging lives that follow make them regret it.</p>
<p>&emsp;There are privileges to the highest ranks of the Academy. They are the benefits I earn, but I never have the time to enjoy or take advantage of. Cadets in the academy are coined &quot;Firebrands,&quot; after the stray embers that spread wildfires far beyond their place of origin. Brought together, these Firebrands form Fireteams, clusters of four cadets raised together since early childhood, forming formidable friendships and bonds that carry into their service beyond the walls. Together, Romin, Valentina, Sylvia and I constitute Fireteam 473, one of the few groups skilled enough to rank among the top one percent. </p>
<p>&emsp;But I&apos;m not the only member to abandon their privilege &mdash;&mdash; in fact, Sylvia is the only one to continually take residence in the towers (and although my abandonment errs on the side of service, Valentina and Romin haven&apos;t so much as lived there.) </p>
<p>&emsp;Whether by hedonism or loyalty, Valentina and Romin enjoy lavish lifestyles at the forefront of their factions, connected by blood to the highest powers of the Merlot and the Carmine. Romin is consumed in his promise to become the Son of the Carmine. Valentina . . . I don&apos;t really have any idea what she does up in her Vermillion Tower unless her family&apos;s extravagant parties bring us up there. But considering that coveted geothermal warmth of the sprawling central peaks &mdash; shrouded in mystery by smog and clouds that shadow anything of their wealth &mdash; I doubt they&apos;ll be burning any money staying warm while the whole rest of the city lives on ice. </p>
<p>&emsp;Trains take cadets to-and-from the city in large droves, packed tight with little space to spare, the only available type of transit through the inner walls. My commitments always leave me at the tail-end of any rush hour when the trolley cars are near empty, when only the residents of the Academy and their guests are able to ride, and they&apos;re often heavily intoxicated, headed back after a long darktime of drinking, steeling themselves to fight a horrendous hangover.</p>
<p>&emsp;Before the Snowdrifter run, our fireteam went into the city to celebrate the start of the break, and with half-price drinks on the Academy stipend, I was trying to forget a lot when I went in there.</p>
<p>&emsp;I trace through my memories of that darktime. Valentina concealed herself with a woven pink sunhat in the absence of sun. She gets catty and loud after the first few rounds, but it&apos;s easy to tolerate when she ends up buying the drinks. While she was occupied chatting-up her fans, Romin&apos;s solemn stare scared them off, allowing them no more than a question of her name before they duck for another crowd.</p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia&apos;s always light on clothes. She wore one of Valentina&apos;s (many) old dresses, untailored to her measurements, crushing her in a space that Valentina could barely fill. It made me laugh, how misplaced the vibrant colors of Val&apos;s wardrobe were on Sylvia&apos;s body: most days Sylvia struggled to get ready, showing up to lectures with her hair still damp. In my presence, she always seemed to reject the advances from any suitors that offered her a hand. The crimson mark and hood were enough to get Romin and I a fair amount of attention, though at least I never pursued it. All I could remember were several faces of nameless women, Romin whispering &apos;too ugly&apos; or &apos;too fat&apos; or &apos;you can do better than that&apos; until he stopped judging for me and got wrapped up with someone else. I chatted with a girl whose name I forgot. And after Romin quickly disappeared, Sylvia left upset, and Valentina absconded off with another high-ranking firebrand. Academy dating is shallow, the way cadets pursue one-night stands and drunken nights to quell their crippling anxieties of the unknown world that awaits them. At least for the middle and lower classes, the overdose deaths, grievous injuries, and suicides got so severe that each graduating class was forcibly placed on dry probation at least two weeks before the ceremony that sent them beyond the walls. Whoever that girl was, she just wanted a taste of the world a little higher towards the clouds, and I wanted no part of that emptiness.</p>
<p>&emsp;The Dragon Class tower is a great stone edifice from two-hundred-and-fifty years ago, once a mansion of the richest families in Blackwater before the Fall of Nordhaven, repurposed for Academy cadets. Inside the front doors spreads a posh interior with crystal chandeliers and carpets brighter red than the midday sun through the smoke. Several cadets stand inside, faces I hardly recognize, and the distaste of conversation carries me around the corner to the back entrance, up the poorly-lit stairwell, and into my room, where I can be alone.</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m drawn to darkness like moths to flame. It&apos;s not a feeling of comfort, really&mdash;when I lay in bed and stare at the same ceiling, so familiar with the contours of every crack that I can close my eyes and still see them, it&apos;s a feeling of cessation, but not a feeling of comfort. I find no reason to move once I lay there. Sometimes I hold my breath until I find a convincing reason to release, thinking one day I might suffocate, but that primal fear always drives the wind back into my lungs. </p>
<p>&emsp;Is that what I live for, then? Do I live for fear?</p>
<p>&emsp;It feels like I&apos;m attached to everything but feel nothing. My eyes trace the contours of the room after they adjust. It feels like a crypt, and with the windows open, no energy will ever enter or exit this place. Two years here and it&apos;s still empty: the only things I&apos;ve brought to this place are a folding chair, several books, and enough clothes to get through each week. The floors are spotless and polished from the cleaners; dust and spiderwebs would accumulate in the corners otherwise, and on the table still rests a yellowed card that reads WELCOME FIREBRAND! CONGRATS ON YOUR DRAGON CLASS ACHIEVEMENT.</p>
<p>&emsp;Hours pass. Or minutes. I&apos;m not sure. It feels almost as if I&apos;m outside of time. Maybe if I lay here forever, I&apos;ll never have to say goodbye to Ellie myself. I can&apos;t get myself to sign the papers. I fear the future for the atrophy of close bonds with my friends, few in number but so strong in connection, and I know that no matter what I simply can&apos;t let go. Sometimes it feels I float over a vacuous space, tethered there by the finest threads of past desires, of a time when I might have known what I wanted out of this life. Entropy dissolves. The smoke never returns to the cigar once it leaves. When Ellie mixes the peas and carrots that I chop for her, they never return to the same order as when I first prepared it. And so the threads of passion fray like the telomeres that age me: they got me to the top of my class, and the only way there is without emotion.</p>
<p>&emsp;The future is entirely blank, and it terrifies me. The escapism lies in my memories: painted through the rose-colored glasses of those chapters of my life when my mother was around and Ellie was just born. Clint was a good father, then, who had the energy to reach beyond himself &mdash; he&apos;d take me on his shoulders after a long day, and often grill for us late in the evenings &mdash; he could make the cheapest cut of whatever we could afford taste amazing. But the uncertainty of our future still lingers there.</p>
<p>&emsp;I stir myself beneath bundles of weighted blankets to keep me warm when I hear a knock outside. Probably for someone else, I think. Unit 407 next door is a party room, and they&apos;re always drinking. </p>
<p>&emsp;But the knock persists. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;Open up.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;I lay in bed, thinking if I stay here, she won&apos;t think I&apos;m home. Anything leading me closer to that red-hot, painful reality of our separation drives me further away.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know you&apos;re in there. I know you, Titus,&quot; she says, but I still don&apos;t feel myself move. Like holding my breath. Waiting until I find a reason to get up, to participate.</p>
<p>&emsp;A minute passes. Maybe another, and she knocks one last time. I watch the two shadows beneath the crack of the door disappear, and the disappointment of a self-hatred overtakes me that I could let this moment pass.</p>
<p>&emsp;I open the door. &quot;Hey,&quot; I say, weakly, and she turns around from walking halfway down the hall. I comb my mess of jet-black hair into some semblance of order, and she lets out a trite laugh.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Mr. Valedictorian. Hope you&apos;re not playing too hard with your time off,&quot; she says. I feel the same sadness in her eyes of our upcoming separation. Her posture hunches like usual &mdash; if she ever stood tall, she&apos;d be taller than me. &quot;You really worry me sometimes, Titus.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;I&apos;m fine. Just a little nervous, I guess, you know.&quot; My eyes struggle to meet hers, but they persist, weakly, to look in her bright-red rings. She&apos;s wearing makeup. I can&apos;t remember the last time she dressed this nicely. </p>
<p>&emsp;She looks beautiful.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Merlot&apos;s Graduate Ball just started, and I&apos;m sure it will be going all night,&quot; she says. &quot;You still have a chance to go.&quot; It might be the last, she means.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So why aren&apos;t you there?&quot; I ask. &quot;Why did you leave?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not the same without the person I wanted to spend it with,&quot; she says. &quot;You&apos;re the one who holds our friendship together. Romin doesn&apos;t have anyone to bounce his sultry jokes off of, and Valentina&apos;s energy feels more like her acting than anything real. We all feel there&apos;s someone missing. And me? I&mdash;&quot; The door blows open. She shivers. &quot;Ugh, it&apos;s so fridging cold in there. Are the windows open?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Forgot to shut them,&quot; I say, though I know she disbelieves me. I close the windows and turn on the heater. She follows me in, closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>&emsp;&quot;You sacrifice so much, yet you take so little. I worry so often that you never take enough,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I sit next to her. She reclines on the bed, sprawled with her arms against the sheets.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But others need me,&quot; I tell her. &quot;I can&apos;t give up on them. In this life, I&apos;ve come to realize that I was born a sacrifice. The orphanage, taking care of you, fighting hard enough that we&apos;d amount to anything, it&apos;s what I&apos;m good at.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But you never release the weight of all that negativity,&quot; she says. </p>
<p>&emsp;I just wish I had time,&quot; I say. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sometimes you just have to let go, Titus,&quot; Sylvia insisted, &quot;no matter how painful it is, you have to succumb to it.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;But she&apos;s wrong. </p>
<p>&emsp;That kind of thinking is why her combat scores are so far below us, unable to toughen up, too lost in soft hobbies to galvanize herself in the crucible of combat. </p>
<p>&emsp;But I&apos;ll never tell her that. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t always have to be so polarized towards strength. It&apos;s okay to have others protect you,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And thinking like that is what will kill us on the outside,&quot; I say. &quot;You know how many people return&mdash;&mdash; how they say &apos;softness of the mind and tongue dulls your blade.&apos;&quot; Her insistence doesn&apos;t faze me at all, and although the sickness of a storm rages inside me, I know it is just the strength of my spirit, the endurance of my determination.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;If you say so. I pray to the Gods the world can one day prove you different,&quot; Sylvia replies. </p>
<p>&emsp;I change the subject, just to hold her here longer. </p>
<p>&emsp;She talks on about her work, designing posters for the Academy, how annoying lettering is writing FEAR THE CHYMAERA! a hundred-or-so times, how her hands shake on her third cup, how hard it is to make deadlines. I just like to listen to her speak. I love to hear the sound of her voice and the smallest mannerisms of her speech. When you have a friend for this long, it reminds you the world still spins beyond the horizon of your own fears and worries, and it feels like a stabilizing center-of-gravity.</p>
<p>&emsp;She rests her head against my shoulder&mdash;just like our late nights at the orphanage as kids&mdash;as if she&apos;s drawing energy from the warmth of my body, enough to get her by for the rest of the week. &quot;You know, it&apos;s an anomaly.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;How you&apos;re so handsome and wonderful, but you can&apos;t land someone special,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I shrug. &quot;Maybe one day. When I&apos;m ready and I have the time,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;A little while later, when we say goodnight, she gives be a big, sweet hug and I embrace her tightly, almost as if to say she understood it all completely, and I relished just long enough before the discomfort made me release.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I love you,&quot; Sylvia says. Then she quickly adds, &quot;We all love you, Titus.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know,&quot; I say. &quot;And . . . you too, Sylvia. Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I watch her leave as a certain emptiness sits in my stomach, much like the room behind me. For such a spacious, designer room, it perplexed me why a single pole stabbed through from the ceiling to the floor, inexplicably there, just like the houses beyond the walls, or like a dagger in a drawer of spoons. I found my arms wrapped around it again, feeling the minutes pass until the distance had dissolved, and that hollow space had been filled, or masked, or stabilized, with something strong enough to set me back to sleep.</p>
<p>&emsp;I leave the windows open.</p>

<p>&emsp;I lay on the hardwood floor. Perverse thoughts in my mind tell me I don&apos;t deserve the comfort of the bed, so I lay there, listening to the reverberations of a party below.</p>
<p>&emsp;I let time pass by for what feels like hours, until I think my guilt can lift me from the floor, but it never arrives. I think about the radiant glow of the necklace enveloping my father&apos;s shop&mdash;it wasn&apos;t the first time that an Outwaller artifact had gone off on us. In fact, it is my only proof that a God might exist, and the absurdity of those moments often blend into the dullness of my daily life &mdash; saturated in propaganda posters, in crimson-font books administered by the Ministry of Courage, and in the repetition of combat training where we&apos;re pitted against other fireteams.</p>
<p>&emsp;The hardwood floor doesn&apos;t bother me. I&apos;m used to sleeping on rough surfaces after years of survival training in the Academy, drilling as my team&apos;s Tactician or unofficial leader, and so I feel myself melt into the hardness of the floor.</p>
<p>&emsp;The same dream comes to me. For a moment I stand in the infinite space of a dark landscape, the smell of ozone overpowering. Is it beyond the walls? A great cavern? Or somewhere beyond space itself? Thousands of graves lie before me on an endless plane of ash. Most of the bodies wear Academy marks, others wear ordinary clothes, and almost all of them seem to be the same age. I pray they aren&apos;t dreams of a horrible future. I hope they&apos;re not the lives of my fellow cadets in our service beyond the walls. I spend so many nights in this lifeless internal space &mdash; I&apos;m unable to move, without a body, just a spectator to the grounds of a boundless crypt, but I can feel the coldness of my surroundings. I can imagine the abrasiveness of the ash, hear the crackle of distant fires, cascading embers from indiscernible skies and amethyst glows in the veins of rotten flesh. No words are spoken here, there is no one left to speak them. I am just a ghost of a forgotten time, bearing witness to either a horrendous future or a miserable nightmare.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s almost time.&quot; The voice speaks from a directionless origin. Its vibrations resonate within me. Am I speaking it to someone else? Or is it a voice of an internal force? Or&mdash;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Years you&apos;ve lived since that time. Maybe you&apos;ve forgotten, or tried to forget. But your connection has been snagged on that incident, that choice.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I try my vocal chords, but nothing resonates; all I can do is listen. A whole life I&apos;ve lived with only the memory of the orphanage, of the brutal fights and violence to prove my worth as a tool galvanized by teeth and blood.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A column of light marks the start of your true journey. Only if you accept the natural path, will you ever be free.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Darkness swallows the forms in the furthest distance. The bubble of this dream is collapsing. I can hear my voice being called from somewhere far beyond. The ground shakes. Ash shudders and lifts into the air like a great sandstorm on the gale of otherworldly winds, and everything begins to crumble to dust, returning to the most basic form of all matter.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Die to yourself or you will live forever, son.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;A sound at the corner of the stairwell awakes me. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus! Titus.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Heavy footfalls cascade against the carpet. Light seeps through the edges of the blackout curtains. Gods, It&apos;s almost afternoon. How long was I asleep?</p>
<p>&emsp;The footsteps are heavy, but not that heavy. Boots. Was it Sylvia? Or Valentina? No way she&apos;d come down here.</p>
<p>&emsp;A fist pounds on the door. &quot;Titus, Titus, open up,&quot; a voice slurs. The voice sounds drunk, male. But it isn&apos;t Romin.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Who&apos;s asking?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Dammit. Open the door, son.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint? What are you doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just open up,&quot; he demanded. But why&mdash; he stays in the store as if he&apos;s chained to it. I hear his heavy breathing&mdash;either he took a flight of stairs too fast or is on the verge of throwing up.</p>
<p>&emsp;I lift myself from the floor. My knees crack. The door opens, cracked. But I&apos;m wrong: he isn&apos;t drunk. Fear flushes his face, an emotion I haven&apos;t seen in him since I can remember.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sons&apos;a bitches broke in, Titus,&quot; he says, &quot;I couldn&apos;t stop them, they took that damn thing you brought in. Told them we were closed, told them to come in the lighttime, first it was the Carmine, then bastards wearin&apos; all black, and...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Slow down,&quot; I say. His face swells with bruises. Dried blood runs in two parallel lines from his nose, and he can hardly speak, and I want to tell him that I told him so. &quot;When did this happen?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I was sleepin&apos; in the back room. Heard a knock on the door, told them the store was closed,&quot; he says. &quot;First it was the Carmine. Said they&apos;d be willing to pay handsomely for that thing you brought in earlier, knew we had it, they saw the light. Told us that the next party to show up would kill for it. I told them to wait &apos;till lighttime when we were open, but &apos;no,&apos; they said, &apos;they&apos;ll kill you for it if we don&apos;t take it now,&apos; they says. &apos;Then let them come,&apos; I say.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Carmine came for it first,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;He nods. &quot;Gods, I should have just let the Carmine take it, I didn&apos;t think they were serious. The next group came an hour ago. Dressed in all black. Said they were from the City Guard, but they didn&apos;t look like guards. Said they was trying to keep all the humans alive. On my, last refusal then they kicked down the door, a whole lot of &apos;em, and they took the necklace right from my hands.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I asked, &quot;So what does that have to do with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You mean, your injured father? Broken doors that&apos;ll cost a week&apos;s earnings for a locksmith?&quot; Clint says. The only thing that holds him to this life is threatened. The existential horror registers in his expression. &quot;My shop . . . er, our shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel the apathy swell within me, and the approach of my uncertain future grate on me. My focus is far beyond this.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s your shop.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean? It&apos;s ours,&quot; he says. It almost seems like my father is on the verge of tears, and it frightens me, but I still feel that force of resentment and anger that tears me from him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ours only when you want it to be. I have so much more to deal with right now.&quot; The anger pushes the next words. &quot;More important things.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well . . . you, I . . . I just wanted . . .&quot; he stammers, but it eludes him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then I guess you should &apos;quit being a pussy and handle it,&apos;&quot; I tell him, before slamming the door. His somber footsteps drag him away. I hear a sniffle.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You know, you leaving and all . . . I know I&apos;m not good with feelings, but it&apos;s just as hard for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;So hard he can&apos;t show up to my graduation, to see my speech, on the most important day of my life. I could tell he was day-drinking during that time. I could smell it on his breath. I don&apos;t respond, and he walks further. A sickness in my stomach rises as the distance grows between us. Is it guilt I feel? Do I feel bad? Or does his absence feel healing?</p>
<p>&emsp;His voice is so different from normal that it haunts me. &quot;Promise we&apos;ll talk. There&apos;s so much I want to say to you. I&apos;m terrible with feelings, and you are, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I sit on the floor, back against the door, but my vocal chords refuse.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve always . . .&quot; he says, but can&apos;t finish the thought before discomfort overtakes him, and a deep, saturating pain stings inside my heart. I sit on the verge of tears, but my eyes remain dry, building pressure there instead. </p>

<p>&emsp;The rest of the day passes slowly. Three days remain before we&apos;re called to action. The phone on my desk rattles on occasion with calls from the operator, so I unplug it. Knocks sound on the door, but I can&apos;t lift myself.</p>
<p>&emsp;I eat snacks stashed beneath my bed. I throw the wrappers on the floor. The maid service has ended; no one will be around anymore to pick them up. I wonder how many cadets have passed through this space, how differently each Firebrand might have furnished it. Over there is a window with a beautiful view. Four scuff marks speak that it was once a place where a couch peered out. A smaller spread near the opposite wall shows where a film projector might have rested, brought by some rich cadet, and I recall that on my first night here, I found reels of a movie called &quot;Fear The Chymaera&quot; left behind, one that Valentina acted in as a child. Did this place once hold celebrations? How many people have passed through the front door? And how many of them are alive today, living somewhere in the city?</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s the transience of such a space that is so hard to believe, how many proud families unpacked their children&apos;s furniture and closets into this room. Beyond the walls of this temporary home, loud bustling and burdened voices echo through the halls. The Firebrands unpack their things, leaving these spaces vacant for the next proud cadets to live. This space is naught but a temporary place of residence; a base camp, if you will; a place of operations; a bed to sleep and a desk to work; not holding permanence of any kind.</p>
<p>&emsp;But I have so little to pack.</p>
<p>&emsp;Nowhere has ever felt permanent. The bills for my childhood home pile up on my desk, and I&apos;ve finally crossed the threshold where all my savings can no longer hold. The demands from the child welfare service are addressed to me now, threatening to take Ellie from me, and for months I&apos;ve ripped them up. I refuse to believe that they will take her: lies of families all over the capital, in other districts, that avidly pursue her. But where else could she be comfortable beside in my arms?</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;ll be away on service for a while. But I can make it work. I&apos;ll make more money. I can pay for the tutors. Hell, maybe Clint will take over. I can pay for the housekeepers, all the people that will keep the house the same way I remembered it. I can love her from a distance. I know I can, and just that idea gives me the strength to move on.</p>
<p>&emsp;Another darktime approaches. And at one point, I hear commotion from the balcony next door. Upset voices&mdash;too late to be anything related to moving, since the dragging ended hours ago, and the service elevator hasn&apos;t chimed since I last awoke from my third nap.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, you can&apos;t just barge in here. Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just a second,&quot; the voice says. &quot;Did you know your neighbor&apos;s deaf? He can&apos;t hear me unless I barge in.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Get out!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The sliding door on the adjacent balcony rattles open, slamming as it reaches the end of its track. I hear a sound of heavy effort. Some massive creature moves beyond the window glass of my balcony door.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, you&apos;re going to kill yourself,&quot; my neighbors say, but the figure continues grunting. &quot;You&apos;re going to break the railing! You&apos;re paying for&mdash;Help! Anyone, get in here!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I hear metal screech. The creature shrieks in panic, and I jump from my bed, sprinting to the door. That can&apos;t actually be him. No way. I have to look like I was doing something, like I wasn&apos;t just laying in bed for two days, and so I flick the lights on, running my fingers through my hair a little, and I lift a book.</p>
<p>&emsp;A thud resounds outside somewhere. It feels as if the cantilever balcony is going to snap from the sudden load. The neighbors curse, the drunk creature laughs, and the neighbors curse even harder. The door flies open, nearly shattering the frame at the stop, and he enters.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You bastard.&quot; He heaves between breaths. &quot;You know what I had to do to get in here? Good thing those jerks next door aren&apos;t your neighbors anymore,&quot; he says, with the door still open and the neighbors on the balcony.</p>
<p>&emsp;He stumbles to the telephone resting on the only table in the room, palming the whole thing with a single hand, finding no tension pulling it downward from the power cord. The power cord is disconnected, and he knows I unplugged it.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Really? Really, Titus?&quot; he says. &quot;And what could you possibly be reading? Classes are over. Thermal Properties of Essence? I don&apos;t even know what that is, and there&apos;s no extra credit anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He swats the book out of my hands. It slams against the wall between me and my newly-disgruntled neighbors, leaving a dent in the wall that I&apos;ll probably be paying premium for.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You should be getting drunk with us. Making memories. Val and Sylvia got so upset they made me do this. No&mdash;YOU made me do this, and I&apos;m upset now, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Romin, it&apos;s just been&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Tough? Hard?&quot; he says. &quot;And you know how we deal with those feelings? We get trashed. We get trashed, and we deal with them together. We&apos;re running out of time, Titus.&quot; Romin turns me to the door. There&apos;s no refusing the grasp of someone twice your size. &quot;Open the door and say you&apos;re excited to see them,&quot; he demands.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Can I put on a shirt first?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You did this to yourself,&quot; he says, blocking my access to the rest of the room. I sigh and slowly creak it open. Valentina and Sylvia are on the other side, along with most of the hallway, peering out at the ruckus from their rooms. Their eyes trace from my face to my pajama pants, than back to my face again, a slight look of surprise and disgust mixed together.</p>
<p>&emsp;I repeat Romin&apos;s words, mechanically. &quot;I am excited, to see you,&quot; I tell them.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Can we come in? Gods. After you . . . get ready?&quot; Valentina asks, turning away from the doorway, her face blushed bright red as Sylvia turns the other way.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ready for what?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;For our night out,&quot; Valentina says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Now get ready. Take off your pants.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;In front of you? Now? Wait&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Or I&apos;ll take them off for you. I&apos;ve seen your naked ass more times than Sylvia, I&apos;m sure of it,&quot; he says, and Sylvia mutters something indiscernible from behind the door, probably flushed with color.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We don&apos;t do that,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We don&apos;t do that my ass,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Or your ass. Off. And put on some damn pants. Something nice. We&apos;re going back to the Merlot district, and Valentina&apos;s gonna get us in everywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I slip on some jeans that sprawled on the floor for days like rotten pasta, unwashed and odorous like the rest of my room.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Good. Now let your girlfriend pick a nice shirt for you,&quot; Romin says. He turns to the two girls beyond the door. &quot;He unplugged the phone, can you believe this idiot? I told you we had to save him.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re not . . .&quot; Sylvia mumbles.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You can come in,&quot; I say. My social aversion has no foot in the door against my sudden fear of Romin. And strangely, I find myself a little less empty.</p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia&apos;s face is still flushed red. &quot;A shirt . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re the artist. Pick something flashy. We&apos;re getting my boy laid tonight,&quot; Romin says. Sylvia recoils at those words with a certain disgust, bending down to thumb through my limited closet. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No.&quot; Valentina says, &quot;No, no, no, no, no. This isn&apos;t just a &apos;guys night out.&apos; This is a night for us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, one of us is getting laid tonight, at least,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Who&apos;s it going to be?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What does that even mean, Romin?&quot; Valentina asks, rhetorically, knowing there&apos;s no reconciling his madness. </p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia hands me a shirt, the one she&apos;s told me is her favorite one. &quot;Good choice,&quot; I tell her. She smiles.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The trains run until long past midnight over break. Tonight&apos;s gonna be a great night,&quot; Romin says, and he turns to me. &quot;Don&apos;t expect to come back here. You&apos;ve slept enough, pal. Time to burn off some of that energy.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I don&apos;t have any money up here,&quot; I say. &quot;If we&apos;re gonna go, let me get some from the house.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not a problem,&quot; Romin says. He turns to Sylvia and Valentina. &quot;You deserve a good celebration for how hard you&apos;ve fought to be Valedictorian, and you deserve to know how the three of us&mdash;&quot; he gestures towards them and they nod&mdash; &quot;feel strongly about you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Heat thaws my heart a little further. I smile, genuinely, putting aside the anxieties of the unsettled life I&apos;ll be leaving behind. Either way, I&apos;ll be figuring it out later. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks, guys. Let&apos;s get going then,&quot; I say. &quot;Like you said. This is a night to remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;Bright, flashing bulbs bathe the streets in blinding light, but not enough to melt the fine layer of snow on the asphalt. Speedsters and touring cars cycle past at blistering speeds, leaving parallel tracks of black ice behind. Painted posters and advertisements cover every space where a brick wall frames no windows, and illuminated signs project their slogans large enough to see a hundred yards away.</p>
<p>&emsp;The streets are flooded with activity. A cross-street sign reads Vermillion Boulevard, and remembering her ease of public recognition, Valentina dips her trademark hat to cover her features.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin makes fun of Valentina&apos;s hats again, how she infallibly wears one every day, saying that &quot;maybe she&apos;s balding,&quot; that she&apos;ll lose her fame to bad genetics. </p>
<p>&emsp;She slaps him across the face. </p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia points at the poster she designed for a play titled THE PHANTOM ABSOLUTION, telling me all the techniques of the brushstrokes and why she picked the colors. Romin and Valentina hold hands tonight for some reason. Sylvia takes my arm, and through her thick fur coat, emblazoned by the ruby marks of Dragon Class, I can feel her shiver.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;One bar?&quot; I ask. &quot;Or many?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;One. And only the best,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;You&apos;re on Vermillion boulevard. We have to go to Club Vermillion. A whole luxury row reserved by our family every night, whether we use it or not,&quot; she boasts.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just along for the ride,&quot; I say. I&apos;m the only one strong enough to drag Romin&apos;s drunk corpse home, even if it&apos;s only a tenth of the way. </p>
<p>&emsp;I turn to him. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Do you mind sleeping on the street again? Last time you were picking up half-smoked cigarette butts and smoking them down to the nub, saying you wouldn&apos;t leave any &apos;wounded soldiers.&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not this time,&quot; he says. &quot;Because this isn&apos;t a &apos;guys night out,&apos; right, Val?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gross,&quot; she replies.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin leads the pack. He cuts through the downstream crowds like a boulder through eddies, and we follow behind him, with me as the anchor. So many other Cadets walk with their fireteams, parting at the sight of our insignias. I get several congratulations in passing on being the Valedictorian. Most of them stumble. Some shout at the touring cars. Fewer get into fights, and even less are entirely sober. With all the shimmering crimson cloaks, it looks like a river of blood through the veins of our city&apos;s streets&mdash;but at the end, furnished in grandiose, crystalline decorations and gold-plated brick is Club Vermillion, with a line stretching far up the block.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Vermillion,&quot; Valentina tells the bouncer when we arrive.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s the name of the place,&quot; he says. &quot;Get in line.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Valentina Vermillion,&quot; she states, lifting her hat, as the other three of us stand off to the side, making small talk, and I&apos;m the only one who watches the exchange.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Miss. You&apos;re not on the list anymore,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why, my family owns this bloody place, it&apos;s in the name,&quot; she says, embarrassed, looking around to see if anyone noticed. I lower my eyes, pretending to listen to Romin ramble on about why the Carmine-allied pub is better. She refuses to raise her voice further. A scene is the last thing she wants to make. &quot;If you don&apos;t let me in, I&apos;ll have your job! Who made the request?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It was Mother Vermillion,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; she whispers. &quot;Just let us in. Last time I&apos;ll be bothering anyone for this, Marcel.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He draws a breath in indecision. He checks his watch. &quot;I&apos;m gonna be reporting this, you know. To your family.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t care about my family. Just the name,&quot; Valentina says. Romin and Sylvia turn their heads, but they don&apos;t hear her, thinking it to be friendly conversation.</p>
<p>&emsp;Marcel steps away from the door. &quot;Right this way,&quot; he says, and we follow Valentina in. She tips her hat upwards, and a line of frustrated glares quickly exchange for recognition. &quot;Valentina! Valentina!&quot; they shout, but she doesn&apos;t turn an eye. Instead, a look of disappointment and sadness dissolves under the influence of her theatric prowess, traded so suddenly for her family&apos;s famed charisma that lights up an entire room.</p>

<p>&emsp;The Vermillion VIP section is tucked to the right of the stage, always reserved, so close to the live band that you could practically walk-on and play. It seems the rest of the staff is unaware of her sudden loss of access. I see a relief settle in Valentina&apos;s eyes when the section is empty: she probably anticipated the presence of her father, Vince; her older sister, Vera; youngest sister Vanna; young brother, Virgil; or her vile mother, Victoria.</p>
<p>&emsp;We approach the single booth, surprised to find half-empty drink glasses when we settle in. &quot;Looks like someone&apos;s been here,&quot; Romin says, and a sudden look of fear crests her face. </p>
<p>&emsp;I can feel her ego disturbed by that uncertainty. &quot;It&apos;s fine. My family must have been here. Probably left since it got so busy, ironic how they own several clubs and hate excessively loud noise,&quot; she laughs.</p>
<p>&emsp;But as we sit down, she catches the eye of someone else in the crowd. Her calm charisma is no match for the fright that shocks her, and I follow her eyes. It&apos;s her sister, Vera, along with her Class VI fireteam, dancing on the main floor: one of the few high-ranking groups that managed to reach above us.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sister, so great to see you,&quot; Valentina says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m surprised you made it in, dear,&quot; Vera says, and Val&apos;s lucky the rest of them take it as a joke. &quot;We were sitting here first, but you&apos;re welcome to join us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The other three members of her fireteam are cadets I&apos;ve only confronted on the combat field and in passing: some of the few that could beat me, higher achievers than us as a collective.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin! How&apos;s District Twelve treating you?&quot; Jarrett says, embellished with the same rare crimson pin that denotes high Carmine leadership.</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s eyes darken. &quot;Still functioning,&quot; he says. &quot;So your family leads District Seven.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; he says. &quot;I just like Academy Twelve better, I guess. My family figured it was much easier than the District Seven academy. How&apos;s your family?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin scrunches a little, an unsettling sight. He mumbles. &quot;The Brotherhood is great. My family, though&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. That&apos;s right. I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s fine,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;re lucky. Leadership is a lot easier when you have the shoulders of giants to stand on, and a father to . . . you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;Well, District Twelve is still remembered the best. Your brother was a great hero. Ryder, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; Romin says, shivering a little in that shadow. Before he can respond, their entourage produces a red-haired figure from behind them.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Hey, Sylvia,&quot; Delvin says, directly turning to her. &quot;I didn&apos;t get to talk to you at the Merlot Ball last night. You left so early,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot; Sorry, Delvin,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;Something came up and I had to head back.&quot; Our heads turn, and I can feel how much she despises being the center of attention.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, maybe you can make it up to me with a dance,&quot; he says, and Sylvia agrees. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s have a round of drinks!&quot; Vera exclaims, watching as Sylvia and Delvin dance to an upbeat song. Delvin&apos;s hand shifts to her waist, but no lower.</p>
<p>&emsp;The last of their posse arrives: Isla, a brilliant cadet almost a head shorter than me, applying for Intelligence. I often see her in passing&mdash;sometimes she invited me to lunch during the Academy since we had so many classes together.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Heya, Titus,&quot; she says, taking Sylvia&apos;s seat. &quot;Nice speech at graduation.&quot; The others around the table agree, exchanging words of pride over my accomplishment.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; I respond.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I took all the same classes you did,&quot; Isla says. &quot;And still . . . you managed to beat me. What&apos;s your secret?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Liquid anxiety. It&apos;s called caffeine,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, damn,&quot; she says, &quot;I did just about the same thing. A perfect grade average, and you still managed to win. How&apos;s that?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I tell her, slightly annoyed, but I can sincerely tell her energy doesn&apos;t come from jealousy, just conversation. She elbows me.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, either way we&apos;ll be seeing each other a lot. I assume you&apos;re going into intelligence? Leadership?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Something like that.&quot; As if I had the time to consider &mdash; I can hardly hold on as it is.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;My father followed the same track. The benefits are exceptional. And he empowered me to take the same path,&quot; she says, giggling as if laughter were punctuation.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I guess I&apos;ll have to look into it, then.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Vera turns to me. &quot;So what do you want to do, Valedictorian? What&apos;s the next big plan?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Whatever lets me take care of my sister and my family. I really care about her a lot,&quot; I say. &quot;And I hope working with the Royal Guard and all&mdash;either working up near the peaks of the Afterlife or out as a commander on the front lines&mdash;that I get to come back and see her.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, we&apos;re all gonna miss home. Our families,&quot; Vera says. &quot;My family has a big celebration planned for us . . . er, me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What about you, Valentina?&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;You should all be celebrating together, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She shifts uncomfortably. &quot;Er . . . yeah, but I&apos;m planning on doing my own thing!&quot; She says. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; asks Jarrett.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not with Vera. But the studio. The studio is throwing a celebration for me. Ever since I was a child, I&apos;ve been in film, and met so many people there. Just don&apos;t want to steal the thunder of a shared celebration,&quot; she says, returning an icy glare at Vera.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well I hope you visit, love,&quot; Vera replies. &quot;Because I know your family wants to see you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So,&quot; interrupts Romin. &quot;What has everyone done with their free time?&quot; He turns, prompting Valentina.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m wrapping up a photo shoot for my last film,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a great one.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Spending as much time as I can with our family. I&apos;ll miss them so much,&quot; Vera says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Preparing the documents for transition of leadership after my service,&quot; Jarrett says, &quot;and also spending time with my family. Isla?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Studying.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Studying!&quot; Vera recoils in disbelief. &quot;Studying for what? What else is there to study for, dear?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I just . . . want to be at the top of my game,&quot; she says, turning her head to me. Sitting down, we&apos;re still not close to the same height. &quot;There&apos;s still a lot of people to look up to.&quot; She turns to me.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I see,&quot; Vera says. &quot;And Titus?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Spending time with my sister. Getting all my affairs in order,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And spending most of it in your dorm,&quot; Romin says, followed by a laugh.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;In your dorm?&quot; Vera laughs. &quot;And &apos;getting your affairs in order.&apos; Are you planning to die out there?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course not,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;Isla whispers in my ear, casting surprise gooseflesh. &quot;For all that time in your room, you should have invited me.&quot; Her legs touch mine beneath the table, and I feel her hand brush my outer thigh.</p>
<p>&emsp;Jarrett cuts her off.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I just wish I had your dedication, man,&quot; he says. &quot;With that spirit and drive, he&apos;d be high in the Carmine, don&apos;t you think, Romin?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, he sure would,&quot; Romin says. I can tell that he&apos;s already drained of energy, a rare sight.</p>
<p>&emsp;Isla leans against me again. &quot;You see them over there,&quot; she says, pointing to Sylvia and Delvin. &quot;I&apos;ve been trying to set them up for ages. Delvin really likes her. I just wonder if tonight will be the night.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, really?&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I already set them up on two dates. They had coffee two days ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, really.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I guess we all just want to get some action before the end of this chapter,&quot; Isla says. Delvin and Sylvia never return to the table. I can see Delvin is really trying. Sylvia smiles. Does she like it?</p>
<p>&emsp;I refuse to look their way another time, not even noticing when the two of them disappear.</p>
<p>&emsp;We all reach our goal. Everyone is pleasantly plastered, and we leave the Vermillion Club while it&apos;s still darktime. We exchange pleasantries, planning as if there were a future time we could ever get back together again. I find myself enjoying their fireteam, and by the end of it, Romin and Jarrett are beckoning songs of the Carmine with their arms around each other, laughing and dancing as two brothers that met for the first time.</p>
<p>&emsp;Valentina falls behind with her sister, exchanging unpleasantries or something that upsets both of them. Vera embraces Valentina, and then she takes one of the courtesy travel cars for the Vermillion mansion.</p>
<p>&emsp;I fall back to talk to her. She wipes tears from her sleeves, and I ask her if she&apos;s alright.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Fine,&quot; she says. &quot;Just . . . I&apos;m not too caught up emotionally to where I should be at this point, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Is everything alright? With your family, I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. The celebration is still on.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You mean with the studio?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There is no celebration with the studio,&quot; she says. &quot;I made it up, Titus.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sorry, I won&apos;t probe further. But...&quot; I find the firewater churning in my gut usher uncomfortable feelings. &quot;...You know, you guys pulled me out of a really rough patch. Don&apos;t forget that I&apos;m here for you, too,&quot; I tell her, and she nods, tears escaping her further. </p>
<p>&emsp;I stay there as the others press on, embracing her as she buries her head into my chest, sobbing, and it makes me think of Sylvia, concerned about her, hoping that she is alright, while I feel the slightest emotion of irreversible regret. Isla catches my eye, and she waits there, realizing I fell behind, as if she waits to invite me somewhere.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You know why you&apos;re the glue that holds us together,&quot; Valentina says. Her bright, blond-white hair catches snowflakes as we bathe in the amber light of flashbulbs, still bright even in the hours just before lighttime. &quot;Because you have the heart that joins all of us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She looks at me with a glance of sincere appreciation, unmasked by the faces she wears for Academy programs and public life. Her face is untensioned, and I realize I&apos;ve never seen her in this light before.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I feel safe with you,&quot; she says. &quot;You, and Romin, and Sylvia. I&apos;m just so scared of what comes next . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Me, too,&quot; I say, taking her hand, leading her toward the rest of our group: one of the last ones to brave the frosted streets as we retreat from the warm foothills to the streetcars. I feel her fingers tension in my grasp. Her hands are warm. But all I can think of is someone else.</p>
<p>&emsp;We drop our hands. Romin&apos;s still laughing with his new best friend, forgetting all his feelings of jealousy, the both of them saluting at every Carmine brother or sister that passes as passersby glare.</p>
<p>&emsp;A hollowness urges me to motion as Isla trails behind. So many hours I&apos;ve spent alone in my room as if I could procrastinate my fears away.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Do you want to come over?&quot; Isla asks.</p>

<p>&emsp;First light flashes in the bulbs of streetlamps when I approach the railing of the eighth floor Academy lofts, drawing a cigar to my lips. I hardly smoke. Not like Romin or my father. I have a cigar when I reach the end of a frame of life, looking out upon the expanse of a beautiful view, elevated high as if to convince myself that I can see all the paths my future will take me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I breathe in the texture of past experiences, collecting those memories in my lungs to hold them in one last time before I release them forever. The words go first, then the crispness of the image, until all that&apos;s left is the feeling, only to ever be coaxed out by an artifact of that past, slipping away as silver smoke in the early morning air.</p>
<p>&emsp;Back when the world was less heavy on my shoulders, Romin and I would climb to the summit of one of Blackwater&apos;s bluffs. Though the smoke obscured so much of the city, there was a liberation in the feeling of height: as if all your problems were smaller than the scale of the familiar buildings of our childhood town far below. And after a while &mdash; between shifts of the Blackwater Electric workers, in that five-or-ten minute gap when the generators catch and lights flicker &mdash; production halts and you can hear silence for the first time in what feels like ages: not distracted by the white noise of fluorescent lights nose-deep in a textbook; not the background noise of chatter or combat in the Academy training gyms; not the stupor of drunken cadets finding any reason to celebrate on the floor above.</p>
<p>&emsp;But I never allowed myself to get used to that silence in those rapid spells of calm emptiness. The older I got, the further my life and demands took me&mdash;and the less I heard that silence ring in my ears that felt like the frequency of the world itself, beyond Essence or any gift the Gods of the Afterlife can bestow. It&apos;s probably the reason the beers I choose to drink are non-alcoholic, and why I can&apos;t indulge in more than one cigarette at a time. </p>
<p>&emsp;I only have one. </p>
<p>&emsp;I throw the rest of the pack in the trash bin and head inside, exhaustion eclipsing the episode of excitement with Isla as reality returns. The windows are still open. The shades are still drawn and the room is cold, but the comforter is so warm.</p>
<p>&emsp;Out there beyond the dusty, frosted panes of glass, silhouettes dance in rectangles of light like frames of a movie projected through a screen door. I wonder how many times it&apos;s been that I&apos;ve taken in the same sight. What view will I wake to in the next chapter? And what will be the last image every night the next hundred times I go to sleep?</p>
<p>&emsp;You can tell slumber approaches soon when your blood runs with molasses and your eyes feather shut, when your racing mind jumps between impossible tangents that hold no weight in logic or meaning. I can swear I hear that silence again when sound fades from my awareness, the faintest frequency. But the creak of my bedroom door opens my eyes with enough of a start to set me awake.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m sorry . . .&quot; Sylvia says, her words slurring, her hair disheveled and the left strap of her dress bent around the side of her shoulder.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sylvia, Gods . . . You should have called! I would have walked you home,&quot; I tell her, slurring my words too, but only because I&apos;ve left half my mind on the edge of sleep. &quot;I didn&apos;t think you were coming back to the lofts tonight, after you left with . . . him,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It wasn&apos;t much,&quot; she says. &quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But why didn&apos;t Delvin walk you?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because I didn&apos;t want to go home,&quot; she says, punctuated by a hiccup and a stutter.</p>
<p>&emsp;I rise from the sheets. Exhaustion fades fast when it&apos;s replaced with that feeling. &quot;Come here, I&apos;ll take care of you,&quot; I tell her, sitting on the edge of the bed as she approaches.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You always do, but I&apos;m okay this time. I need to tell you something. Before it wears off . . . before I lose the spirit to . . . before we run out of time,&quot; she says, as if on the verge of tears, but it&apos;s too dark to tell.</p>
<p>&emsp;I stand. &quot;Let me get you some water. I&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sit,&quot; she demands, pressing her hand against my right shoulder as she pushes me into the bed. Her breath is warm with cinnamon. Her black hair is coarse when it brushes against me. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I hoped tonight would have been so different than it was,&quot; she says, &quot;but it&apos;s always distractions, I hoped I had the chance to make you feel it, so that you might believe me when I tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I can feel my feelings stir towards their own emotional truth. But my jaw is locked, my tongue weighs heavy, and I can&apos;t usher the question to ask what she means. Nor can I meet her eyes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re drunk, Sylvia,&quot; I tell her. She looks frustrated when she can&apos;t rearrange the words in her head. I don&apos;t want her to.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No! I know, but...&quot; she insists. I stand up, walking towards the sink in the half-bathroom as she reclines on the bed as if I could escape. I&apos;m not ready. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I want you to know. That I&apos;m always watching you, ever since the orphanage, ever since you saved me from it, ever since you showed me that kindness, you know, because . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let me get you some water,&quot; I tell her. I feel my hands tremble in the sink with the cup in my hand, and it reminds me of a time I wish I could forget.</p>
<p>&emsp;When I return, she grasps the cup with shaking hands and I realize how cold she is, and I wonder how far she walked in the dark alone. My room is just as cold as the frost outside, but this time, the window is closed. I wrap two blankets as her eyes softly close. I rest my hand on her, whispering the words to myself when I know she can&apos;t hear them. The fluorescent lamps of early lighttime brighten the motes of dust like embers, and they dance with her shallow breaths as I sit there.</p>
<p>&emsp;She flinches in her sleep. Ever since the orphanage she&apos;s always dreamt of the times I tried to forget. And sometimes I find myself dreaming of the same thing.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s too dark to tell whether the tears crest in her eyes. She mutters words I can&apos;t recognize, and I can&apos;t discern whether she feigns her slumber. Her arms reach to grab for something without pillows atop the bed, and she surprises me, dragging me backwards to embrace my head in a space right beneath hers. Her grasp is strong, and once I feel the warmth and softness of her body, I find no desire to escape. My stomach still churns on fear of all the futures I can imagine. There are so many who depend on me. The ball and chain weighs heavy, but it feels so good, because at least it keeps me grounded.</p>
<p>&emsp;I should thank Romin he plugged the phone into the wall while I was changing&mdash;it awakes us near mid-morning, and I flinch up from finding my head on Sylvia, her arms still wrapped around me like I&apos;m a pillow.</p>
<p>&emsp;I quickly draw the phone to my ear. &quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus, it&apos;s Clint,&quot; he says, scrambling for breath. &quot;The storehouse is burning! Damn vandals . . . arsonists . . . Guard with their questions . . . Get down here, now!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel my heart rise into my throat. I leave Sylvia still dreaming, no longer flinching from hours of our peaceful, drunken sleep.</p>

<p>&emsp;1&quot;It wasn&apos;t me, son, I swear &mdash; why would I burn my own property?&quot; Clint says. His head sinks in his hands. A handprint of ash drags across his cheeks. &quot;But these bastards think they knew what they saw.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, what did you see?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I only caught a flash of it. There&apos;s been a couple of &apos;em, out late during darktime, who&apos;ve been tryin&apos; the locks at the storehouse and I yell &apos;em off&mdash; early this morning they broke the locks and made it in. Went over to call &apos;em out, but I only caught a glimpse of them as they left, wearing city guards&apos; gear, just as the whole place lit up. You have to tell them, son, they won&apos;t listen to me,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You sure?&quot; I say. &quot;Because the last time I checked, Everett had that place insured, and . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint yanks the throat of my collar to his face. &quot;And you think I&apos;m lying about it? You think I&apos;m that low, son?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Two weeks before Everett&apos;s insurance was supposed to expire on the place, and we&apos;d have to pay for renewal, I saw the letters in the mail,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it wouldn&apos;t sell before, no matter how hard Everett tried,&quot; I say, &quot;you remember?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I&apos;d never do that, son,&quot; Clint says. The anger dissolves from his eyes, traded for the rare complexion of weakness or grief. I find myself believing him. &quot;I&apos;ll do anything to protect you and Ellie, anything within the bounds of the law. In fact, it&apos;s not even mine anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The surprise short-circuits my mind. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You . . . you fucking sold it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;In the best interest of our family,&quot; he says. &quot;The deal was just about to go through &mdash; I let them visit to unload their things early.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I told you. I told you not to do that. Never! Not for this pathetic sinkhole of a shop! Are you kidding me?&quot; I yell. Others start to glare.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, it wasn&apos;t willed to you, you stubborn prick. It was willed to me! Everett. My father &mdash;&quot; His words trail off: thoughts unable to hold weight, so they float into the air, just as the city guards approach.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll have to take you in for some questioning since you&apos;re a person of interest,&quot; they say.</p>
<p>&emsp;Anger and sadness clash in his mind until a single emotion wins over. He lifts himself to his feet, and I&apos;m reminded of how scrawny he&apos;s become since his days as a guard: hardly eating, just enough to keep the shop running, just to stoke the continuous dream. &quot;Alright,&quot; he mutters. &quot;But you&apos;ll get nothing. Nothing! Years serving this city, and when I retire, all you do is forget and screw me over!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The scene clears out after half an hour. Clean-up crews still sort through the wreckage: it looks as if someone dumped a large bag of charcoal in a warehouse-sized firepit. And for the first time in years, not a single light glows in the window of Clint&apos;s shop&mdash;not in the reflection of the trinkets, not the military surplus gear, nor the shimmer from his reading spectacles when he does some accounting at the lonely desk facing the window.</p>
<p>&emsp;The news filters through slow as molasses throughout the day, and observations bleed in crimson ink across the headlines. It began as reports on the burning of the property: the smoldering blaze that lasted for hours. City patrol said the fire started from inside the property, from a room in the basement, spreading outwards until the warehouse collapsed on itself like a house of cards, and the descending flurries of snow were no match for it. The cold gusts of air had naught a chance to put it out either &mdash; and it was left in ashen ruins until evening before crews sorted through the rubble.</p>
<p>&emsp;It was then and only then that the source of the fire was discovered, along with the bodies, charred black to a crisp as if the Chymaerans had sucked the life from them, but scalding burns alone weren&apos;t the only abuse these bodies had taken, stab wounds so deep the fusing of flesh in the combustion failed to mend their skin together, some entry wounds so deep they penetrated all the way through the bodies.</p>
<p>&emsp;The cadavers&apos; clothes were entirely singed off, but the metallic melted plates fused on their shoulders, and it was this fact alone that revealed their identity. The same plates I wore when I was an early cadet in their combat training schools. The same plates Romin wore to the academy sometimes when a &quot;family job&quot; ran long and went all night, it was the symbol of the Carmine: the same insignia proudly worn by nearly ten percent of Blackwater (or those courageous enough to show their colors in public.) It isn&apos;t until the morning after that Romin&apos;s tirade explains the rest.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Those sons of bitches! I told them it was a setup,&quot; Romin shouts. &quot;Those Vermillion bastards killed them . . . &quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;The Carmine compound swarms with activity. They&apos;re armed for war. Caches of weapons are brandished from their crates and the courtyards flood with faces I&apos;ve never seen, every able-bodied soldier coaxed from the woodwork. If there&apos;s one thing our city is good at, it&apos;s spreading news like wildfire&mdash;where daily news drops like the Firebrands beyond the walls.</p>
<p>&emsp;And the only reason this all happens, the only reason it&apos;s possible for the Carmine to get in? Because they own the place. And they were only kids. Kids of the Carmine officers who were unloading boxes for allowance money.</p>
<p>&emsp;My father sold the damn place behind my back and didn&apos;t even tell me about it, which cuts me deeper than the possibility of it being insurance fraud in the first place. After extensive interrogation, he was absolved of being a suspect of the crime. And he can&apos;t sink any lower in the list of people I don&apos;t trust, even lower than Romin hiding cards under the table when we gamble for money on the weekends.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They were kids, Titus! I saw them just yesterday, I swear. Imagine, just imagine... imagine if that was Ellie in there, dead, all for nothing, not even seizing any of our product, all just for murder, all for blood, all just to send a damn message or, I don&apos;t know, just to . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin. Just think about this for a minute before you do something you&apos;ll regret.&quot; He appears almost twice as big when he&apos;s angry and agreeing with him might exacerbate his livid anger. &quot;Why would the Merlot do this?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because it was them! Their gear. Their foot soldiers left it in the wreckage.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But what would even trigger this?&quot; I ask. &quot;Think, Romin, what reason would they have? You understand people better than I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin scoffs. His fists clench in tight boulders. &quot;So a setup? Who else than the Merlot would dare try to stop us? They&apos;ve had it out for us ever since we decided to protect the people and resist against their draconian bloody laws.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It just doesn&apos;t feel right,&quot; I tell him, but his anger eclipses any hope of sensibility in his mind: it&apos;s a natural state for him, and after years of skirmishes with the Merlot, their entire brotherhood is far from forgiveness. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We need more bombings to show them who really runs the city. Shoot first, ask questions later&mdash;give the enemy some dead to mourn before we talk,&quot; Romin says.</p>
<p>&emsp;Only my father and grandfather remember the riots from before I was born. Five percent of the properties in the city were reduced to ashes. It was only several leaders&apos; houses that they targeted, but the perfect conditions of wind and heat erupted it into a full firestorm. Shattered glass from the looting scattered across the streets, and there was so much property damage that the entire city shut down for two weeks just to try and recuperate the losses.</p>
<p>&emsp;I hope nothing rash will come from this burning. But the Carmine are too proud of a people, and so many swarmed the compound with such a strong groupthink it will only take minutes before their rage destroys any chance at dialogue.</p>
<p>&emsp;Sometimes days stretch on for lifetimes. And in rare moments of chaos like these, sometimes a life&apos;s-worth of action takes place in the space of hours. And regardless of the rage of the Carmine, there&apos;s one piece of news that still bothers me.</p>
<p>&emsp;The Academy is determined as the safest place for Firebrands and their families. So many accumulate in the District Twelve square: medical tents once purposed for combat trials used to tend to the grievously injured; faction-aligned Cadets arguing and throwing fists to speak for their anger; authority sheepish and cowardly, unable to suppress the anarchy; but it&apos;s not just us. Not just District Twelve.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The entire city of Blackwater is now under a forced curfew,&quot; a speaker repeats above their heads. &quot;Report to your homes or the nearest safe-designated facility.&quot; It wasn&apos;t just the trade house. I might believe it was the first, but at the same time, hundreds of Carmine properties were set ablaze, traces of Merlot gear singed in the wreckage, and I wonder how they could possibly be so careless to leave it behind.</p>
<p>&emsp;But I&apos;m not at the Academy. Through streets of soot and smoke I tread onwards, dodging masses of black-covered instigators and homeless and Outwaller desperates getting in on the anarchy, sure to cover any ties to either faction.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s sick,&quot; Clint says. He&apos;s home for the first time in ages. Ellie sits on the couch. She looks sick and pale, sweating profusely, the veins of her flesh almost looking amethyst under the faint light.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Chymaeran Curse. Like Everett,&quot; Clint says, but he&apos;s wrong. I spent years studying the Chymaerans. I&apos;ve spent just as long looking over Sylvia&apos;s shoulder at the medical books.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Not the Curse. This is something I&apos;ve never seen before.&quot; Ellie doesn&apos;t cry or scream. She just sits there, immobile, as if the joints in her bones have been fused together, drawing labored breaths, extinguished of her young energy, and my father and I panic over what to do next.</p>

<p>&emsp;The Carmine might have sparked the riots, but the city&apos;s anger burns on the fuel of a hundred years of poverty. Inequality bounded the Outwallers on the far edges of the city, fighting to survive their frozen landscapes without the warmth of the inner lands. Now they act out their livid frustrations as if destruction could recuperate even a tenth of their horrible lives.</p>
<p>&emsp;Beyond the walls of this house, I can hear none of it. My heartbeat pulses in my ears. My hands fumble over her, and I curse myself for the lack of knowledge that could save her and bring her back to health. Never have I seen this before in all my years&mdash;in none of the Frosthards beyond the walls that succumbed to Chymaeran attacks; any of the Academy footage and research; not in anything.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ellie. Ellie,&quot; I repeat, over and over. Her flesh is ice, the circumstances inexplicable. There&apos;s nothing within her to possibly make her this sick, and the fear of losing her only makes my hands shake harder.</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint sits beside her. He cradles her frail form in his arms as if the warmth of his body can bring her back, and I can see a restless regret grow in his eyes. He left his shop at the first word of the chaos, returning back to our home for the first time in months, and he found her sprawled out across the floor, incapable of speech and of little motion.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And this is how you found her?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot; Clint&apos;s words are short. &quot;The caretakers should have dropped her off two hours before I arrived. The nanny never came.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Damn it! I should have been here. I should have been here,&quot; I say, and Clint turns to offer a word of reassurance, but my mind races. All I can think of is every lecture I&apos;ve ever had. Obsidian skin covers the Chymaera. The Chymaeran Curse leaves the veins Amethyst. Only in the presence of strong Chymaeran energy can this happen, but why can&apos;t I feel it? Or Clint?</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Was the door unlocked when you came in?&quot; I ask him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It was,&quot; he replies, &quot;but you know how Ellie forgets to lock doors. It could have been the caretakers.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Panicked, I rise my feet. All the energy I have with nothing intelligent to do drives me towards anything. &quot;And you found her here?&quot; I ask him. </p>
<p>&emsp;He nods.</p>
<p>&emsp;I inspect the floor, but nothing stands out to me: I know nothing of what we&apos;re up against. Merlot suspected of raids on the Carmine. The city in flames, looting, anarchy, but how could the Chymaera influence an internal dispute, when they&apos;re far beyond the walls?</p>
<p>&emsp;Just then an energy feathers in the air, carrying a scent of ozone I&apos;ve only noticed miles outside the city. </p>
<p>&emsp;Clint jumps. &quot;No, no, no, stop!&quot; he shouts, and I approach them, only to witness the amethyst spreading faster. </p>
<p>&emsp;She shivers in her sweat.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ellie! You&apos;re fine, you&apos;re alright,&quot; Clint reassures her. With nothing I can do, all I can muster is to lean over the couch and helplessly watch. I can feel the invisible source of danger approaching closer, a certain energy that vibrates every particle of my very existence, resonating with the meager essence in my circuits.</p>
<p>&emsp;The door bursts open, and before either Clint or I can turn around, the intruders announce themselves.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Child Services. We&apos;re taking your daughter to a place where she belongs.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I take in my first glimpse of them: dressed in the sharply-woven threads of Merlotan civil servants, pinkish-red and gold adorned in the accents of their clothing. My teeth nearly chatter when the darktime winds blow in from the street.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;On whose bloody-damn authority?&quot; I ask. </p>
<p>&emsp;And then I think of all the forms Clint pushed on me. Only one person could be responsible for this: the only one who&apos;s passively aware without helping at all.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint, you Gods-damn bastard!&quot; I shout. &quot;You&apos;re the reason they&apos;re here!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I swear to the Gods, Titus,&quot; he says. Holding Ellie, he crumples in what seems like a genuine state of panic, but his lies are always far too convincing.</p>
<p>&emsp;There&apos;s four of them. They circle us, and my breath parts in fading clouds. I consider the door behind us is open, but when I turn to look, I realize it has already been shut.</p>
<p>&emsp;The first dark-haired civil servant drags his finger across the counter. Dust collects between them. And another of them sneezes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Despicable living conditions,&quot; he says. &quot;Hours spent alone without family, and now your daughter is sick from the cold. We&apos;ve received an endless string of reports.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Like fridging hell you have,&quot; I say. My hands tension to fists, and Clint grows defensive like a cornered rabbit as they approach. &quot;From who?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;From Eliza&apos;s teacher, at the Academy. You didn&apos;t think the girl was smart enough to reach out to a real force of reliable authority?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The four social service members approach as Ellie&apos;s condition worsens, and though I open my mouth, Clint speaks first.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You Merlot home-wreckers aren&apos;t allowed to show up without a notice,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;ve sent nothing!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ve sent more than nothing. Three letters, to be exact.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint turns to me, but I beat him to the punch this time. &quot;They&apos;re lying. Not a single letter, not anything, has come to us.&quot; But his face says that he still doesn&apos;t believe me. &quot;Oh, I&apos;m sorry, should I just redirect all the mail to your shop since you practically live there now?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You could try, Titus, just a little bit harder to care for your family!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, when I raise this young girl and you won&apos;t even see her? You haven&apos;t stepped foot in this house in three months!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Three months?&quot; The case worker exclaims. Clint&apos;s face screws up further when we realize I&apos;ve only stirred the pot. &quot;Gods! Poor child.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s coming with us immediately,&quot; the two surrounding my father say. &quot;Give her up. Now.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Over my dead body,&quot; Clint says, but I feel a sickness in my stomach over how all of this adds up. During the riots, at darktime? And not only that, but&mdash;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Who made these reports?&quot; I ask again. I can feel this exchange feathering that line between talk and brutal action, and so I circle left to the fireplace, feeling for cold iron.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Academy teacher.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s my sister&apos;s name again?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;They stumble for answers. &quot;We don&apos;t know all the details. We&apos;re just case workers.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Her name is Ellie. And she goes to Seminary, not the Academy.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I give them a chance to react. At the sight of me brandishing the spade and poker, normal Merlotan desk-jockeys might cower and run or call for backup: not even close to worth their minimum-wage jobs.</p>
<p>&emsp;But their expressions are hauntingly stoic and unmoved, and my heart jumps when I realize the improbable is real. Before the surprise is dead, I take a hard swing with the spade against the back of one intruder, and I&apos;m surprised when I don&apos;t connect with the bones of the spine.</p>
<p>&emsp;But it still keels them over, and they cry out in anguish. Three still stand: one to the left and two to the right, reaching within their coats to pull something a true social worker should never have. I take the spade by the butt edge and feel the weight of it, more unbalanced a tool like a hatchet than the poker, and so I swing it out in a full arc, the sharp edge driven perfectly against the breastbone of the left intruder after two clean spins. But like the last, there&apos;s no clang of hardness when it connects. </p>
<p>&emsp;The two right intruders now brandish iron that shoots, and my mind flips to the rifle Clint stores beneath the bootlegger&apos;s hatch in the kitchen. Too far to reach, I realize, and as I duck for cover behind the couch, Clint rushes up to bash one of the gunman at close range.</p>
<p>&emsp;The rounds blast through the couch fabric. Our ears ring in close quarters. They won&apos;t shoot Ellie because, for some reason, she&apos;s their reason to be here, so I pilfer an unconscious intruder for the hardware they were packing.</p>
<p>&emsp;My training reacts before I can. I cock the hammer of the five-round revolver and scope in beneath the couch: Clint&apos;s boots and a stranger&apos;s pop up and down like the generators&apos; pistons in their tangle. My finger hinges once and the revolver jumps. Something bluer than blood blood sprays against the wall, and the non-brandishing bastard fighting my father yelps for a second.</p>
<p>&emsp;He falls to the ground, and I take a second shot. It digs into the intruder&apos;s shoulder. Clint&apos;s able to overpower him now, but I can visualize the other trigger-happy intruder turning to blast him, so I reach to peek my head above the couch with the handgun. I feel something freezing cold strangle my ankle before I can shoot, and it forces me backwards towards the fireplace. The gun slips from my hand. My head bashes against the brick and fireworks light behind my eyes, while Clint tussles with the bloody bastard on the ground as the other gunman waits for a shot. </p>
<p>&emsp;It comes to me when I turn back to look at the first one I bashed with the spade, purple blood, darkening flesh like a melting black-wax idol, their true identity made, but it&apos;s too late for the information to be useful.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint, they&apos;re Chymaerans!&quot; I shout.</p>
<p>&emsp;That pricey fireplace set mom bought years ago cost extra for three tools instead of two, and I bet Clint would retract his complaining if he saw me reaching for the tongs. The Chymaeran&apos;s grasp is still strong as death and cold as ice. The tongs leap from their hook but fall into the fire, handle-first, and the more I reach, the more I feel a pin-and-needle stabbing pain climb my leg.</p>
<p>&emsp;Something hard clatters against the floor on the other side of the foyer, and I realize it&apos;s the other gunman&apos;s revolver. They fight hand-to-hand now, and as I reach further, inching my fingers just a little bit more, I feel them reach just enough to wrap around the inside edge of the bent metal. The iron is hot. The other end is scalding red, and when I whip it around to strike in and sizzle the Chymaeran&apos;s flesh, I feel the stabbing pain withdraw.</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint still fights with the fourth one, and now that the Chymaerans are exposed for what they really are, no holds barred, I can see Clint&apos;s adversary smirk with a twisted grin. Something changes in the attacker&apos;s right arm, reforming to something slender, obsidian, and black. My struggling father doesn&apos;t notice, and it&apos;s far too late to react, though my hands still clasp around the gun.</p>
<p>&emsp;The slender limb stabs through my father&apos;s chest and he gasps for air, unable to scream. And then it slices again, severing my father&apos;s arm in a swift draw.</p>
<p>&emsp;His blood mixes with the purple ooze dyed into the carpet, and when he collapses, choking on the blood saturated in his punctured lung with only one arm to brace it, the crimson trickles down his chin.</p>
<p>&emsp;Furious, I raise myself to shoot, but my body freezes on a sudden gust of chilling winds. </p>
<p>&emsp;The door is open again. </p>
<p>&emsp;A fifth figure with no disguise has already entered, dressed in a black-hooded cloak. I can feel the strength of their Essence. My blood runs from fluid to molasses to ice, and it feels as if the push-pull command of all my muscles fire at once in perfect balance, my finger hinged around the trigger, trapped in that scarce moment before deliverance.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Fridging hell, you two really did a number on them,&quot; a male voice says. &quot;If I wasn&apos;t here, you probably could have made off with her.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Clint sprawls across the carpet I once played on, as still as I am, his wounds cauterized in this moment by solid blood. Neither of us can manage words, but just watch, as the tall stranger passes the dead Chymaerans, walking directly past the path of my gun.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But if you left, you wouldn&apos;t have anywhere to run. Those shitblood Frosthards and Outwallers both freeze the same &mdash; the only difference is what side of the wall they&apos;re on.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I can feel every cell of my body scream for oxygen: so still I can&apos;t even feel my own heart. I wonder if it still beats in my chest, and whether by fortune or folly my eyes still fix on my dying father. Both him and his attacker are stuck there like the miniatures from the war games Romin and I used to play as kids.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that he notices my line of sight. &quot;Whether you shoot him or not, your father is still going to die a horrible death.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;I can see the anger carved in the opposing Chymaeran&apos;s face, stabbing arms suspended above my father&apos;s heart, trapped in a scene much like the bronzework of the Academy halls.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Shoot him or don&apos;t. Either way you&apos;ll weep over your father. These failures are useless to me every time I send them in,&quot; he says, and he lifts Ellie in his arms. &quot;I&apos;m taking her to a place where she&apos;ll have greater purpose than you or your father can ever give her.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I fight my arms so tenaciously to bend, just a little, to turn the muzzle toward her nihilistic captor, but he&apos;s already reached the door with my sister. As soon as the door slams, I feel my body gasp for air, my pointer finger hinge instinctively around the trigger, and the skull-matter of the Chymaeran spray black tar across Emilia&apos;s floral wallpaper.</p>
<p>&emsp;The further the stranger and my sister slip away from the bloodstained room, the faster my father&apos;s stump un-cauterizes, spilling his life even further in a puddle across the floors and all the sheet-covered upholstery.</p>
<p>&emsp;His eyes turn upwards, but he has no words for me, staring somewhere else far beyond this world, as if he can see the woman behind the portrait he&apos;s drank to on so many late nights. I curse myself in regret over that last act of hubris in the lofts &mdash; slamming that door shut just as he mustered the courage to share his feelings with me &mdash; and I feel the penetrating saturation of self-hate overtake me with every labored breath. The guilt and regrets seize the words in my throat, but his gaze is suddenly serene, and directed right at me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m covered in my father&apos;s blood. I try to do something&mdash;anything&mdash;as the oxygen slowly returns to my pin-and-needle atrophied muscles. My heart pulses, driving the elixir of life through my veins that leaves Clint by the buckets, and I refuse to accept the brutal fact that there&apos;s nothing I can do to save him.</p>
<p>&emsp;He watches me panic. He watches me cry, and I feel his red-caked arm weakly grasping my trembling wrist: soft, and I can feel the last moments of his life transferred through the heat.</p>
<p>&emsp;My first words are the last he&apos;ll hear, and I stumble over them. Apologies. Regrets. The pain of guilt and the irreversibility of how I caused this. I hate myself because I can never be enough, not to anyone, and I abhor that bitter weakness that follows. But the serene look in his eyes gives me pause &mdash; a look of forgiveness, of absolute fatherly love no longer inhibited by his fears and resentment, and then I remember all the best times of my childhood that I repressed, the pride in his eyes, the weight of my light body on his shoulders, the beauty of everything before the blemish in our history that divided us.</p>
<p>&emsp;I still can&apos;t cry as his eyes glaze over, pointed upwards like forgotten glass marbles fixed to the ceiling by an invisible thread, the lightest grasp of his hand on my shoulder weakening as his body runs dry.</p>
<p>&emsp;He finally returned home in the end. Now I pray the Gods will take him to the woman he missed for so long. The only thing that burns brighter now than the self-hatred is another force that drags me even further: the liquid heat of revenge and retribution that only I can deliver alone.</p>
<p>&emsp;The siren wails in the distance, late to answer, and the motif of three shrill tones confirm the terror of what I&apos;ve witnessed.</p>
<p>&emsp;The Chymaerans have breached the walls.</p>

<p>&emsp;The Vermillion estate glistens rose gold on the paydirt of the foothills. Its overly luscious landscapes of bright manicured grass, saturated with antiques of past ages and a staff of so many groundskeepers it could be mistaken as a small village, fails to captivate my attention the way their lascivious ways intend.</p>
<p>&emsp;The highest echelon cadets were sent to the foothills to defend the Merlot against the rage of the Carmine. The only chance at free will I had was to sign on for the Vermillion estate, though I knew Romin wouldn&apos;t be here &mdash; gods know where his rage leads him now.</p>
<p>&emsp;My eyes don&apos;t scan for faces the way the other cadets do. I can only look within myself &mdash; and wonder why emotion fails to twist my stomach or draw tears from my eyes. As panic and anxiety exchange for the long exhaustion of what those emotions cost, I find no catharsis, but that doesn&apos;t surprise me.</p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia and I find ourselves at the heavily-guarded front door. Mercenaries in pink fill the fields like flowers. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m asking where Valentina is. Valentina Vermillion?&quot; I ask, but the guards are oblivious, as if they refuse to recognize her. </p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia and I soon give up, descending the marble steps of the front entry way. Several dozen cadets meander in the grass, either lost or anxiously awaiting further orders.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe it&apos;s a safety thing,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;I can&apos;t think of why else they wouldn&apos;t identify her. We&apos;re only here to protect the head families of the Merlot.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then why is Vera out there?&quot; I point to the well-manicured lawn of verdant grass, bounded by sentries standing at the edges of the metal-barred walls. Vera stands with her full fireteam while we still can&apos;t account for half of ours. Scattered around, the Academy captains stand in as makeshift generals, disseminating commands from higher powers, reminding us of the sanctity of our cause &mdash; defending the Afterlife. Sylvia and I listen in as we head for Vera.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But what about our families? What about the people below?&quot; voices ask, rendered anonymous by the size of the crowd. But they ring out, unanswered.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You will not be here for long, two days at the maximum. The riots are still active, the worst this city has ever seen. Our leaders fear the anger directed at the Merlot and the Afterlife, led by Carmine terrorists,&quot; the Captain says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then why are there so many reports of Chymaerans?&quot; another asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There are no Chymaerans!&quot; the Captain replies. &quot;The Chymaerans are weak. How could they ever breach our walls?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I turn to Sylvia. &quot;I know for certain that they were Chymaerans. Wearing all black. No other faction or agency wears that,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You still haven&apos;t told me what happened,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not important right now,&quot; I say. The endless thoughts have been setting me on edge since the incident, but I guess I&apos;ve done well to hide it. I should panic about Ellie. I should be haunted by the face of my father and the last words he spoke to me, but it&apos;s not a priority.</p>
<p>&emsp;We approach Vera. She reveals all she has heard from Merlotan informants. I grab Vera&apos;s attention between a pause of her speech. &quot;Have there been reports of any other factions&apos; involvement?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;As in neither Merlot or Carmine? Not that I&apos;ve heard of,&quot; Vera says. &quot;All that we know is this issue&apos;s far more severe than we anticipated. And what&apos;s weird? Carmine and Merlot forces alone can&apos;t even equate to all the destruction in the city below.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well there&apos;s a lot of Outwallers. What, forty percent of the population?&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But all of them at once? Most are too uneducated to even read the signs they&apos;d be holding,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;They&apos;re too focused on poverty to understand the depth of Blackwater politics.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And where&apos;s Valentina?&quot; Sylvia interjects.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s here,&quot; Vera says. &quot;She&apos;s in her room, I believe. Do you know where it is?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The guards won&apos;t let us enter, let alone even talk to them,&quot; Sylvia says. But I still want Vera to answer my question. I want to know everything of my sister&apos;s captors. And I know the Chymaera are a part of all of this.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She doesn&apos;t live in the house,&quot; Vera says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean, then?&quot; Sylvia asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So you really don&apos;t know? She hasn&apos;t told you . . . well, of course.&quot; Vera points to a shoddy stone building beside the house. &quot;Check in there.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Is that a . . . shed? Why would she be in there?&quot; Sylvia asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just look,&quot; Lyra says.</p>
<p>&emsp;I speak in a hushed tone when Sylvia walks towards the shed. &quot;The factions, back to that question, is there any other activity? The group that kidnapped my sister&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus, Titus, Titus! I don&apos;t have all the answers,&quot; Vera interjects, &quot;there&apos;s hundreds of missing people. Get in line with the rest of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She shoos us away. We make for the stone building in the corner of the estate, weaving through gardeners and handymen wearing Vermillion attire. It humors me sick to see the rich still care so much about petty appearances, though I have no room to laugh. The stone shed is a square edifice with cobwebs between the eaves and the walls, entirely unkempt, as if purposely neglected by the housekeepers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Fetching supplies? I couldn&apos;t see a woman like Valentina getting her hands dirty,&quot; I tell Sylvia.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She wouldn&apos;t step within a hundred feet of a building like this,&quot; Sylvia replies. We knock on the door. Boots clatter against uncarpeted floors. The door hesitantly opens, just a crack, and Valentina&apos;s face is flushed with embarrassment when she sees us.</p>
                                                                                                "},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"SevenWordSummary":"Valentina is a bastard child.","AutoNameFull":22,"ActNum":1,"ChapterOverride":"","ChapterPart":11,"ChapterFull":11,"VerboseOverride":"","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":22,"Style":"Firebrand","Perspective":"Titus","Index":36,"Label":"Check","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"First Worldline, MF&mdash;Valentina&apos;s Cellar, 08&mdash;Day 08, PM&mdash;Afternoon, Titus Berguard, Sylvia Khiras, Valentina Vermillion, PB&mdash;Valentina is a Mistake","UUID":"35","Synopsis":"Val&apos;s façade crashes.

<p>&emsp;Valentina always talks about her life in pompousness, from the clothes on her back to the jewelry on her wrists and fingers. It is a stark contrast to her room in the cellar. </p>
<p>&emsp;Yes. Her bedroom, in the cellar.</p>
<p>&emsp;Frigid stone walls hold spiderwebs tucked in the corners. The only color comes from the bright vermilion bed with the golden &apos;V&apos; crest on the headboard, swallowing all the color from the room, as if transplanted there like a fresh heart into the chest of a dying body.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They just moved me here. But it&apos;s temporary, since I&apos;m away for a while,&quot; Valentina says. Clothes scatter across the ground in a disheveled mess, with a sea of so many hats I lose count of all the peaks. Every day she wears one. Now I finally see how many she really has.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just temporary. Father&apos;s working on upgrading my room to celebrate graduation.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia and I watch her. She knows the disbelief is beginning to overtake us.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Painters. Designers. Maids, you know,&quot; Valentina says. She&apos;s a good actor and a better liar&mdash; but now, she lacks the energy to carry her image.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just temporary. And . . . Gods, I can&apos;t take it anymore!&quot; She bursts into tears, grasping at her cramped stomach with manicured claws as if her lies have finally come to infect her. She dabs her eyes with a crimson scarf, and I begin to put the pieces together: that jealous glare that always consumed her when her sister Vera was around; their competition over appearance. But now, all that remains is a hollow thousand-yard stare that traces through all her memories of loneliness and shame.</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m at a loss for words&mdash;just to say something that wouldn&apos;t shatter her pride further. Envelopes stack on the dresser, dated for each week, stamped with the title WEEKLY GUEST PROVISIONS, half of them still unopened, addressed to just &quot;Valentina&quot; with the last name excerpted from their covers. Just the fact that this basement was entirely separated from the main house was enough to feel so perverse, the tension of some insidious hatred that Val buried for years.</p>
<p>&emsp;The dam crumbles, and the truth pours out, a discomfort she&apos;s hidden for years without telling us. I wonder if Romin knew anything of this.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;ve been cut off for the last three years?&quot; Sylvia asks. &quot;What do you mean? Why didn&apos;t you tell us?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because if the truth got out, then I&apos;d be severed for good,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;It was only four years ago that my mother found out the truth, thinking I was adopted from another branch of our family. She took me in so lovingly all those years. That damn letter . . .&quot; she says, voice shaking. &quot;That damn letter from my estranged mother, and I wonder if my father even tried to hide it. Does he really care? Does he ever even stand up for me against her, that vile bitch? Gods, it&apos;s not my fault for being born!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The strength of Valentina&apos;s words escapes her. Sylvia speaks her name, trying to soothe her with her voice.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I wasn&apos;t the best daughter either, you know,&quot; she says. &quot;You know, I think I just asked too much, too stuck-up, so I don&apos;t think she was wrong, there was just always this feeling of guilt that came over me again and again, and, and&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;Val, Val. Don&apos;t think for a second&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;-and, and Father would just stand there every time she&apos;d say all those things, and I&apos;d wait for him to cut in, I&apos;d wait for him to say it was all wrong but he&apos;d turn his eyes from me, and Sister would stay away from us until Mother ran out of words to pour her anger . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But you&apos;re here!&quot; I say, &quot;You&apos;re with us, here, and&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m a mistake. I was never meant to be born in this world,&quot; she cries.</p>
<p>&emsp;The reverberations of distant catastrophe echo through the cellar, bringing out the most delicate parts within each of us. I feel the vulnerable part of myself strangled by the hands of a distant pain, something I can&apos;t release, even though Sylvia so freely voices her own feelings of pain. Sylvia sits next to her, but I can&apos;t understand. I don&apos;t know what to do. I feel so uncomfortable, not knowing what to say, still so stuck in my recent past that empathy is unreachable.</p>
<p>&emsp;I just stand there. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Have you ever wanted to meet her?&quot; Sylvia says, trying to derail her train of thoughts.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Her? My mother?&quot; Valentina asked.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Your real mother. I&apos;m sure she loves you so deeply.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s the one thought that&apos;s always held me here,&quot; she whispers, reclining on the bed as Sylvia lays next to her. &quot;If that one day I&apos;d just worn a hat like always . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Sylvia asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The shame. The physical representation of my father&apos;s sin. Proof that there&apos;s such a big world out there hidden from all of us, of other peoples and other allegiances. The secret I&apos;ve hidden since long before we first met, always there just to remind me of my dirty blood.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus and I are always open if you want to tell us,&quot; she whispers. I nod, unable to play the right notes to match the melody of the moment.</p>
<p>&emsp;She purses her lips, sucking the bright red from the sparkling lip gloss caked across them, and the words teeter on the edge of her lips. </p>
<p>&emsp;But it&apos;s more an action than a sentence. </p>
<p>&emsp;Her hand reaches for the top of her hat. &quot;My mother was a stop on that trip that Daddy took to the other lands. He never expected me to be born, never wanted me to be born. And one day he learned that I was alive. He came back to get me: not from a place of love, but a place of fear, afraid of his reputation, of how it might affect him if he didn&apos;t silence the truth. I still remember that day he gave me a hat. He told me to wear it forever, because it was lucky, because it was our secret, and&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She pulls the hat away, and the sight speaks volumes on its own. </p>
<p>&emsp;Twitching blond peaks dial to the sounds of the room. My memory flashes to Everett&apos;s tales from my early childhood: the folk tales, and the word AHKVASAN is the first realization that crosses my mind. </p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m in awe. The blonde peaks of her ears softly twitch at the deep intonation of my voice.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s incredible!&quot; I say. The words escape before I can stop them. Sylvia jumps. Valentina still tenses in anticipation of our reactions, but slowly loosens, and I know she couldn&apos;t ever conceive of my response. &quot;That&apos;s incredible, are you kidding me? All these years of Everett&apos;s stories, and all those fairy tales, the Carmine, me thinking he was crazy saying it was all real, and . . .&quot; I laugh, too elated to speak.</p>
<p>&emsp;She blushes. For the first time in days, I watched her crack a smile as she began to laugh, too, and soon the entire chamber echoes with laughter until she is crying tears in good humor.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I love you even more now, if I didn&apos;t already love you before,&quot; Sylvia says, as Valentina gains the light of a realization she&apos;s missed for far too long.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve lived my whole life afraid of myself. Now that I&apos;m no longer silenced by the threat of being severed from this family, everything feels a little bit lighter,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;I haven&apos;t stopped thinking about your speech at graduation, Titus, and I know those words came from your soul. We have to let go. Of everything. Of all that pain and feel into it.&quot; </p>
It hurts to know the words were nothing to me, just projections of a higher truth others wanted to hear. But if it can give her genuine strength, I find that&apos;s all that matters."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":3,"SevenWordSummary":"Titus&apos; nightmares: father and thread.","AutoNameFull":23,"ActNum":1,"ChapterOverride":"","ChapterPart":11,"ChapterFull":11,"VerboseOverride":"","ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":23,"Style":"Firebrand","Perspective":"Titus","Index":37,"Label":"Check","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"First Worldline, Vision (Foreshadowing), MF&mdash;Valentina&apos;s Cellar, 08&mdash;Day 08, LN&mdash;Late Evening, Titus Berguard, Clint (Mentioned)","UUID":"36","Synopsis":"Titus&apos; dream.","NextPublish":"<$custom:NextPublish","VerboseID":"1.11.23","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"DocName":"BWZI","Body":"
<p>&emsp;We find a strange peace that night. While others camp outside in tents just beyond the property, the three of us remain inside the claustrophobic shed. Sylvia sleeps in the bed with Valentina. I sleep on a bed of hats to keep warm.</p>
<p>&emsp;The dreams grow stronger, and I&apos;m no longer plagued by the same recurring dream. I dream of the coldness of my father&apos;s figure, still sprawled across the floor somewhere in a pool of his own blood, his glance forever fixed beyond the door I left open. I can feel the regret of his thoughts. From miles away I can sense his soul still wandering the halls of that house he tried to forget, forever waking to open the door of my sister&apos;s room to find she&apos;s been lost. The depth of the red puddle grows. It catches my ankles as I stand over him, and as if it were stretching the edge of a deep lake, I fall into it, unable to paddle.</p>
<p>&emsp;I suffocate in his crimson shadow.</p>
<p>&emsp;I thrash for minutes until I&apos;m deprived of energy. My lungs scream for air, but I will my mouth shut. Though oxygen is extinguished, I find that they don&apos;t burn.</p>
<p>&emsp;I open my eyes to find the water is deep cobalt. There&apos;s no shimmering crest where the water touches the sky, and I feel the pressure of depth without a light to bring me back. There is only a lantern in my hand, its beacon only strong enough to light an arm&apos;s length ahead, and around me, charcoal black stalagmites stab from gravel sedimentation.</p>
<p>&emsp;The only sensation of touch is something bound to my wrist&mdash;a thread, thin but unbreakable, tensioned to something far beyond the murky depths, and it drags me between the obsidian rocks. A deep acoustic vibration reverberates through the water. I&apos;m being pulled faster. And the louder it gets, the stronger the black statues harmonize. Statues, not stalagmites: the further I go, the more the geometry diminishes in its abstraction, like unfinished sculptures the artist quit after chiseling a general form. I&apos;m dragged faster. The thread digs further into my wrist, stitching my forearm higher and higher, tensioning until I can feel my pulse, but all I can watch are the figures&mdash;so real now, so lifelike&mdash;and they&apos;re no longer trapped to the curse of their rigid medium.</p>
<p>&emsp;Their arms are reaching for me, still too slow. It&apos;s as if I&apos;m watching evolution in a matter of seconds. Their surfaces so impossibly smooth as if sanded for thousands of years by the persistence of the water, grasping as if I&apos;m the only source of motion that can save them from the darkness.</p>
I can feel them touch with their cold, brutal forms, pleading: their voices now audible, and now I know the source of those vibrations that were once so far away. But the thread doesn&apos;t allow me to stop, to do anything. It drags me, onward, until the tension is unbearable, until the drag of the water is so strong I feel as if my arm will sever, and I can feel myself passing out, unable to hold on to consciousness while the thread stitches my entire arm, and so I let go."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Endogeny","SevenWordSummary":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Twelve","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Twelve","ActNum":1,"ChapterOverride":"","ChapterPart":12,"ChapterFull":12,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Style":"Firebrand","Perspective":"Titus","Index":38,"Label":"No Label","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"37","Synopsis":"The party discovers a sinister Chymaeran agent.","NextPublish":"<$custom:NextPublish","VerboseID":"1.12","VerboseOverride":"","Links":{"Wattpad":"https://www.wattpad.com/user/SavantGuarde","Personal":"https://autononymous.io/authors-and-stories/savantguarde/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand/firebrand-1-12","RoyalRoad":"https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/109661/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand-book-one","AO3":"https://archiveofourown.org/works/63835228/chapters/164388721","DeviantArt":"https://www.deviantart.com/savant-guarde"},"DocName":"

<p>&emsp;I awake to Valentina, her face flushed with panic, staring beyond the grated cellar window at the commotion. Her ears twitch as she trembles, focus attuned to something indiscernible. </p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia is still asleep. It&apos;s only several hours that we&apos;ve been out. We slept so peacefully with no anticipation: though it&apos;s anger that fuels the lower riots, most Firebrands believe our orders to be a temporary endeavor. Even my own mind begins to slip over the possibility of the Chymaerans breaching the city. Had it all been a hallucination? Was it some other external force that took my sister away? I know for sure they weren&apos;t Merlot or Carmine mercenaries, as they were draped in all black.</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m still uncertain of when I&apos;ll tell them. I don&apos;t think I will. All my fears are just a drop in the sea of anxious faces &mdash; that all of Blackwater is far too deep to surface from.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus,&quot; she whispers, &quot;are you awake?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. What?&quot; I ask. </p>
<p>&emsp;She motions for me to approach the window. &quot;Are the Firebrands supposed to leave their tents? There&apos;s a bunch of them walking around. The lights aren&apos;t even on in there anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Probably because they&apos;re all asleep,&quot; I say. But wait. No, they couldn&apos;t all be asleep. Some have to be on night watch. Although my eyes have already adjusted to the darkness, I struggle to determine what walks the grounds. It&apos;s as if the figures themselves are made of darkness. The lights are out. I begin to wonder if a quiet force swept through all the tents, when I hear a faint voice calling out to them.</p>
<p>&emsp;A sleepless Firebrand strides from the house to the lawn, and his voice piques with recognition. &quot;Erik. It&apos;s not your shift yet,&quot; he says. &quot;What are you doing up?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The other figure doesn&apos;t reply. I can&apos;t even see them from the frame of the thick stone window, though I can tell they&apos;re approaching.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Say something, you idiot,&quot; he says. &quot;Are you still giving me the silent treatment because I stole some of your rations? Whoa, Erik, what&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Silence. The Firebrand falls. Valentina gasps, covering her mouth. My heart skips a beat, and I step back, but something bothers me. I wasn&apos;t afraid by the severance of that cadet&apos;s speech, but the way he fell over. It didn&apos;t look as if anything had struck him. He didn&apos;t fall flat. He didn&apos;t crumple. His body didn&apos;t react in any way I expected, but rather as if it were amorphous, made of some tar-like substance. Memory of the term &quot;Black Bile&quot; flashes into my mind &mdash; a phrase Ellie&apos;s captors spoke before taking her. It&apos;s like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before, no way to explain it. And the unnatural silence falls on us once again before Valentina slams the window and rushes to lock everything separating this space from the outside world.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Up already?&quot; Sylvia mumbles, turning from her sleep. All she finds in us is the stillness of confusion, and I watch her heart jump into her throat.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What did we just see?&quot; Valentina asks. &quot;What was that . . . thing? That cadet was there and then he was gone before he could even finish his sentence.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It was fluid. He didn&apos;t bend or crumple, it&apos;s like he just . . . dissolved, or melted,&quot; Valentina says, and Sylvia sits there, confused, having expected nothing of our excursion to the Vermillion estate. &quot;But there&apos;s hundreds of cadets out there! How could it slip through all of them? Whatever this is&mdash;how couldn&apos;t they shout, not even one of them detect it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Just then, a shrill scream reverberates from somewhere beyond the walls. Inhuman. It reminds me of the bloodcurdling sound foxes make, almost like human voices, but just different enough to feel the fear of its distortion, and in that instant I&apos;m so thankful we decided to sleep here. We&apos;re safe. For now, though none of us know the adversary that surrounds us.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We need to get out of here,&quot; Sylvia says, gathering her things in a frenzied rush.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Absolutely not! We need to stay here. Until help arrives,&quot; Valentina insists. Or until lighttime, until we can tell what we&apos;re up against.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s everywhere. It&apos;s all around us, I can feel it,&quot; Sylvia says, &quot;can&apos;t you feel it? The smell of ozone?&quot; And then I notice the texture of the air. The smell of the Chymaera, of something foul and sickening growing stronger.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The lift. The lift,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;They said tomorrow, our family would be taking it to the upper lands. We just have to tough it out until then.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And you didn&apos;t tell us this before?&quot; I say. &quot;You all just expected to leave everyone behind. Let them all just die?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We couldn&apos;t expect anything like this! It was just until the riots were over. The Afterlife protects the Merlot. My family is their messengers, their enforcers, their distributors of nutrition and power.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Guys&mdash;&quot; Sylvia says, stopping our argument before it can start.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;How do we know this is affecting the whole city? What if this is what they wanted us to defend against, but we just didn&apos;t know it, they didn&apos;t tell us?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That doesn&apos;t matter. We need to get to that lift before it leaves,&quot; Sylvia says.</p>
<p>&emsp;Just then, a siren cracks the air. Flashing lights cast the landscape in blinding white, reflecting the snow as we watch beyond the southern windows. A slight incline affords us the smallest glimpse of the city. The iron gates are indiscernible. A black boulder rests where no earthly object stood before, and we see it between frames of strobe light like a silent picture. Now it&apos;s fluid. Pieces split from it. They grow arms. The masses evolve in seconds to whatever structure best suits them, and they rush towards the source of the sound.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods! Damn it!&quot; Valentina shouts, her voice drowned out by the droning of the siren, and in her betrayal, I realize what that sound represents. Her arms lash at the pieces of her wardrobe scattered across the floor. Sylvia and I do the same. Val seems uncertain of what she&apos;s looking for, until she struggles to lift a large metal grate from the floor. &quot;This is our only way out. Hurry. Those . . . bastards can&apos;t leave without us,&quot; she says, between breaths. My back cramps as we lift the heavy iron. Below is a drainage tunnel, a little large to drain such a small space. But considering the scandals of wealthy life and Lord Vermillion&apos;s taste for affairs, I don&apos;t question it.</p>
<p>&emsp;Valentina drops in. Her boots clatter against concrete, and instead of waiting for the three of us to replace the grate, she storms off, just as Sylvia inches herself below the ledge.</p>
<p>&emsp;I shout. &quot;Valentina, wait!&quot; but she&apos;s already disappeared into the darkness, and I jump straight in without grasping the sides. All I can hear is the echo of her frantic footfalls. I call for her, until breathing her name subtracts the air I need to sprint for her. Sylvia follows somewhere behind me. All that reverberates is the faint droning of the siren, growing louder as we approach. When darkness engulfs us, we fumble for the walls, and I hear the splash of her boots between bursts.</p>
<p>&emsp;A light crests the end of the tunnel, flashing, though too far away to distinguish any of our immediate obstacles. My breath tastes like poison. Sylvia grasps the back of my coat, asking nonverbally to lead her from this place.</p>
<p>&emsp;I call for her one last time before I make a blind dash. Physical obstructions can&apos;t stop me. All I can think of is losing a cherished friend beyond just Ellie and Clint, what terrible things might befall her, and after the death of my father, watching his soul squeezed from the narrow vessel of his body, the fear of losing others overrides the anxieties of my own life.</p>
<p>&emsp;I stumble over boulders and rocks and curse the uneven corridors. My knees and shins are shredded by shear stone, though Sylvia still follows behind me, almost keeping the same pace. I can see her silhouette. We&apos;re so close to the end. The flashing is brighter, it covers more of the tunnel, and I can see the faint stream of still wastewater glimmer, hear the weight of Valentina steps as she sets the water in disturbance.</p>
<p>&emsp;The sounds are deafening, echoing until the alarm is a droning scream. I reach out for her. My hand slips: a sting pierces my nerves when I realize my hands are sliced to hell, but I keep running. She&apos;s right there, and I can even hear her crying, sniffles between breaths as she chokes over mucus from crying and exhaustion.</p>
<p>&emsp;We&apos;re too late. </p>
<p>&emsp;The great trolley is reduced to the size of a fist in the distance, climbing the hill like a landslide in reverse. Four Vermillions peak from the railing, silhouetted by cabin light, and one smokes a cigar.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m still your daughter,&quot; Valentina whispers. She falls to her knees in the mud, face saturated in streaks of dirt as she watches her betrayal. Her exhaustion trades for helplessness, unable to find the motivation to take another step, now fully stripped of that identity she so reluctantly held to with a white-knuckle grasp.</p>
<p>&emsp;But whatever the tar is, and whatever form it takes, we can feel it approaching. The Merlot were never interested in saving Blackwater, nor in managing it. And for a moment I think I understand completely. They were only emissaries of the Afterlife because of a promise to be saved. But it only takes moments before I&apos;m proven wrong again.</p>
<p>&emsp;The shockwaves of a distant pop crest our eardrums before the hillside glows orange. Flaming refuse cascades from above. Screeching metal screams as it tears, obliterating the tracks, tearing like a caught hangnail ripping the flesh of the stark earth.</p>
<p>&emsp;Valentina&apos;s eyes glow jade green as she rises to her feet. I watch the wreckage reach a standstill, as if suspended in place, the fire no longer flickering, as if it were painted there with luminescent acrylic, unable to move. </p>
<p>&emsp;Humans have the powers of life and fire; Chymaerans of frost and death. But Ahkvasans, from all the forbidden tales my grandfather read to me &mdash; can manipulate the fabric of something different.</p>
<p>&emsp;Time halts to a near standstill, as if fate wills us a chance to escape. The air around me is too slow to draw in my lungs and produce words as Sylvia and I halt our momentum to turn around, but Valentina has fully risen, and her emerald glare penetrates us.</p>
<p>&emsp;The tears stream from her eyes. I realize she has no intention of leaving this place, and I have no power to persuade her. Snuffed of purpose or attachment, she reaches her arms towards us, giving us all the push we need to change our direction and dive for the tunnel. The refuse cascades from the skies before we can reach to save her. She allows the weight of her family above to crush her.</p>
<p>&emsp;Time returns when the hard parts of her crack and she is gone forever. Entombed in her family&apos;s steel duplicity, we never find her, without time to search or bury what&apos;s left.</p>
<p>&emsp;A sound of rustling grasses comes from behind us, and then a whisper: whether they&apos;re hushed voices or the Black Bile, we have no way to know. I reach for my sword, only to realize I left it behind in the rush, along with everything else that might aid me. </p>
<p>&emsp;All I hear is a cry, and I look to Sylvia. Despite the wetness of the rain, reducing her hair to strands of silken black, she sheds no tears, and her chest doesn&apos;t rise or fall. She just stands there, staring in disbelief, as if trying to figure out how she could reverse what just happened.</p>
<p>&emsp;And then it&apos;s several footfalls. The anxiety swells within me, the fight or flight, and I can only think of that ashen adversary drawing closer, panicking over what I might do, wondering what ungodly form it might take, and I grab a severed, rusty bar from the lip of the drainage pipe, hands trembling, unsure of how I&apos;ll even use it.</p>
<p>&emsp;It gets closer, but it sounds like multiple. They get closer. My grip tightens, and I raise the sharp edge, slinking back into the tunnel, knowing the element of surprise is the only leverage I might have, ready to jump, just as Sylvia does the same.</p>
<p>&emsp;And then they&apos;re voices, disjointed, incapable of full sentences. Maybe the tar still holds the minds of their hosts &mdash; their horrific intonation leaves gooseflesh on my body.</p>
<p>&emsp;As soon as it breaks the edge I lunge for it, and it whips around, sword in hand, bashing the metal pipe against the stone wall. It clatters from my grasp, and I&apos;m defenseless. And as I reach to pummel with my right fist, I halt when I see the face of the short figure standing in front of me. </p>
<p>&emsp;Her face flushes of tension. </p>
&quot;Isla,&quot; I whisper."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"SevenWordSummary":"Makeshift fireteam climbs the hills.","AutoNameFull":25,"ActNum":1,"ChapterOverride":"","ChapterPart":12,"ChapterFull":12,"VerboseOverride":"","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":25,"Style":"Firebrand","Perspective":"Titus","Index":40,"Label":"Check","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"First Worldline, MF&mdash;Vermillion Grounds, UF&mdash;Hillside Path, 09&mdash;Day 09, EM&mdash;Early Morning, Titus Berguard, Sylvia Khiras, Isla Assal, Jarrett Reinhard, Delvin (Mentioned), Romin (Mentioned)","UUID":"39","Synopsis":"The four climb the hills.

<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s gone . . .&quot; Isla says, but she&apos;s not speaking of Valentina.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It was all so quick,&quot; Jarrett says. Only the two of them are left. &quot;I woke up. Delvin was shouting, saying he had something on him, and I told him to shut up and stop wasting my sleep. But it was so quiet. Not a light beyond our tent, and not even Isla and Vera&apos;s made any sound. That&apos;s when I turned the light on, and realized the smell, the sight of how badly the tar had already infected him, like nothing I had ever seen before. It had his legs. He felt nothing of it, the whole time it ate him away, and he was unable to lift himself, and as soon as he realized, all he could do was scream.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Isla interjects. &quot;That scream saved my life. I awoke to Vera missing, and it&apos;s only now that I realize what she did to us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That bitch!&quot; Jarrett says, swelling with anger just like Romin does. &quot;Never told us of her plan to escape, and she had all the time in the world. She didn&apos;t care about us living through this, only interested in herself and her family.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And I bet Valentina did too, right?&quot; Isla says, as I gather the last of my things.</p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia responds. &quot;She didn&apos;t. She was left behind, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Are you serious? But why?&quot; Isla asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because her family never cherished her like we do,&quot; Sylvia says. Her look is somber as she raises Valentina&apos;s crimson scarf, the one she wore for years to keep her from the blistering cold, and she wraps it around herelf, taking in the scent of Valentina&apos;s perfume as if Valentina could hug her one last time.</p>
<p>&emsp;Isla and Jarrett nod, not probing any further. Jarrett changes the subject. &quot;So where&apos;s Brother Romin?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Missing,&quot; I tell him. &quot;So drowned in his rage over the trade building that he never answered the call to the Merlot. Have you heard anything from the District Twelve Carmine?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not a thing. I haven&apos;t even heard anything from my family, and I spent all night processing that panic,&quot; Jarrett says. He&apos;s the only one with the stomach to turn his eyes back towards the wreckage, whatever parts of the Vermillion family remain after the explosion.</p>
<p>&emsp;He mutters something indiscernible when something catches his eye, and he bends down to lift a piece of the metallic rubble.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is it, Jarrett?&quot; Isla asks. Just as Jarrett takes the shard of ferric debris in his hands, he winces, dropping it back into the scalding pile of scrap.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Essenced explosives. Not just saltpeter mixed in here, but I don&apos;t get it &mdash; the Carmine would never waste this much Essence.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;These are Carmine explosives,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;The plating is our Essence-infused carbon steel. The only box that can hold that much Essence is one made of Essence itself.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;His words make my thoughts stretch further on where Romin has been, and Sylvia ponders the same question. &quot;Is he . . . really capable of such a thing?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;But Isla refocuses us. &quot;Capable or not, that&apos;s not important right now. We have to press for the Afterlife. The inner walls should protect us. In fact, I bet all the survivors are headed there. We press into the city, we&apos;re as good as dead &mdash; if you figure that Chymaeran creature&apos;s taken the life of everyone down there, just at our greatest moment of weakness.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But what will we find at the top, then?&quot; I ask.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter. We have no other choice. We can only concentrate our forces on one goal, and this is the best option,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;We idle and we die. Assume that Endogeny is driven by life power &mdash; by Essence, and it needs it to survive. The only direction it could possibly travel is towards the Afterlife. Those Chymaeran bastards probably planned this all along, just to destroy the whole city and turn it against itself.&quot;</p>
&quot;Let&apos;s go then,&quot; I say. I take Valentina&apos;s Vermillion rifle, knowing she has no further use for it. Sylvia steadies her bow and prepares her quiver, loaded with Essenced arrows that deliver a punch far stronger than a bullet, the only feature that makes it worthwhile. Though we play a losing game, having lost so much before the start, all we can do is press on in the memory of the ones we&apos;ve lost.

<p>&emsp;It gets warmer the closer we get. Our grafted fireteam sheds skin like a snake, leaving our layers behind in the brush, and I&apos;m already down to a short-sleeve shirt. The air is fresh. Smoke no longer rises from the generators: we&apos;re too far inland to smell the last of it, anyways.</p>
<p>&emsp;There&apos;s little room for talk between heaving breaths. The land is desolate of houses, just stark grasslands, and it infuriates me to think how such land can be unused when the outwallers freeze at the edges of the city. We haven&apos;t seen Endogeny since last night, and we continue climbing up unmarked switchbacks of an untraveled path, hoping the future landscape will open up to anything.</p>
<p>&emsp;We take breaks for Jarrett. Like Romin, his muscle is burdensome, great for quick action and aggressive bursts, but nothing for long distances. We turn around to look at our progress, watching the city grow lower and smaller until buildings are reduced to pebbles in a boundless gravel pit. Despite everything, the view is captivating, and we find ourselves more driven to watch the sight than to press on.</p>
<p>&emsp;The motion feels cathartic despite the worry. I see all the best images float through my mind and out in my heaving breaths. I still see Ellie, knowing nothing of where she was taken. I remember our childhood, the last time she smiled, when mother was still around and Clint didn&apos;t stoop to his endless depression. I know I&apos;m weak, but I find myself praying every hour that I&apos;ll see her again, whether it&apos;s this life or the next one. I know nothing of this world is owed to me, and I learned that fighting tooth and nail for worthiness in the orphanage. But when everything is gone, all that remains is just the flimsiness of hope; the moments when you truly question what immaterial source drives you, what pushes you onwards when nothing remains.</p>
<p>&emsp;All I can do is look to my friends for answers, catching glimpses like cheating during an Academy exam. Isla and Jarrett&apos; expressions are resolute, bodies tensioned, no looseness in them at all. Fear is an exceptional motivator. It&apos;s what drives the Academy, motivating Cadets to climb the ranks: not only fear of failure, but of one&apos;s duty to family and society. I know little of their origins. But without family or society, all that&apos;s left is the anxiety of self-defense against the unknown; the natural Human terror of the dark.</p>
<p>&emsp;But Sylvia surprises me. Her body is as light as theirs is tense, as if she has swallowed the unpalatable weight of grief and begun to process it, and somehow, she looks beautiful: fragile, yet fierce, with a venom that fails to arise from her own vitriol. And then I see the faces of all the people I&apos;ve lost. I feel the blessedness of their presence in my life. I try, just for a moment to be like her, to feel the grief of Valentina&apos;s untimely demise, just as she learned to love herself, wishing so deeply I could undo the pains of that past. </p>
<p>&emsp;I feel my wrist tension. The emotions halt where they always do, and all I have left is to steel myself further. It&apos;s been a full day now, and darkness shadows the horizon. The clouds aren&apos;t too high above us, and I wonder how much further we have.</p>
&quot;We&apos;ll camp here for the night,&quot; Jarrett says, our de-facto leader by size. They left their tents behind, so all we can do is scavenge for sticks, eat our provisions, and cozy by the fire until sleep outweighs the discomfort of the ground. None of us sleep too close. We favor the fire over contact, too absorbed by mutual fears, which are much greater amalgamated mess than Endogeny."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"SevenWordSummary":"Titus gains entrance using fear.","AutoNameFull":27,"ActNum":1,"ChapterOverride":"","ChapterPart":13,"ChapterFull":13,"VerboseOverride":"","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":27,"Style":"Firebrand","Perspective":"Titus","Index":43,"Label":"Check","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"First Worldline, UF&mdash;Dividing Gate, 10&mdash;Day 10, Titus Berguard, Sylvia Khiras, Isla Assal, Jarrett Reinhard, Romin Zebal, Academy Cadets, Valentina (Mentioned), PB&mdash;Romin in in the Shadow","UUID":"42","Synopsis":"Convince cadets to let them in by using fear.","NextPublish":"<$custom:NextPublish","VerboseID":"1.13.27","Links":{"Wattpad":"","Personal":"","RoyalRoad":"","AO3":"","DeviantArt":""},"DocName":"TMZK","Body":"
<p>&emsp;We arrive in the middle of the second day, starving, with no sight of that endogenous black bile. But its presence still lingers close as if it watches us. We catch the irradiated smell of ozone. Sparse trees are stripped of their leaves, and fluid veins glow amethyst. Whether it&apos;s just a property of the upper land, or that Endogeny has drawn such mass that its influence stretches for miles, we don&apos;t know. But a temporary relief rests inside us when we find the inner gates.</p>
<p>&emsp;A cadet hails us from the perimeter walls. He shouts something of Dragon Class, and dirty faces approach the lattice of the portcullis. But the gate doesn&apos;t open.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Prove yourself!&quot; one of them shouts. It&apos;s a lower-class Cadet, but still the highest among them.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Prove what?&quot; Jarrett asks. His irritation peaks from two days of exhaustion. &quot;Just let us in.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Prove you&apos;re not one of them,&quot; he says. He gestures towards the ground beneath the gates, and it&apos;s then that we notice the bodies blended in the brush all around us.. Cadets level rifles to the gates, steadied in the iron mesh, pointed directly at our heads. I look down. Most of the corpses&apos; eyes are amethyst, beginning to fade back from their Human disguises. They&apos;re skin-walkers. The stories are true.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s nothing left to prove, you low-level bastards. Now let us in before I shove those rifles up your ass so far your brain will spray out in gray-matter confetti,&quot; Jarrett says. Carmine run hot-blooded. Some of the minions panic, but their leader is adamant. </p>
<p>&emsp;His fingers touch the lever. &quot;We&apos;re the ones with the upper hand here, not you,&quot; he says. &quot;For all we know, you&apos;re those skin-walkers. Maybe you took the cloaks of Dragon Class and pose as them. We already know they&apos;ve infiltrated the city long before this.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t act like you don&apos;t know, Chymaeran,&quot; he says. I feel an anger twist in me. &quot;A friend I knew for years turned on me.&quot; He shows a scar across his lower torso. &quot;Tried to kill me as soon as things went south, until I killed him first. So don&apos;t think we&apos;re too weak to kill a threat that talks like an ally.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re insane,&quot; Isla says. &quot;Cut your stupid power trip and let us in, that&apos;s an order, Garnet Class,&quot; but he refuses. She only makes the situation worse.</p>
<p>&emsp;One of the Cadets pipes up. &quot;Hey &mdash;&quot; she says, &quot;isn&apos;t that the Valedictorian? From graduation? What&apos;s his name . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot; Several nod, and she turns to their edgy leader. &quot;How else would they know that?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They walk among us. Remember that friend of mine &mdash; they say they even steal their host&apos;s memories.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But that doesn&apos;t justify&mdash;&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;He slaps her across the face. &quot;Don&apos;t speak like that or else we&apos;ll throw you out there with them&mdash;you understand?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Sylvia gasps as she looks at the ground. I follow her gaze, and my stomach crumples at the horror of her realization. At least a third of the corpses were actual cadets &mdash; people whose lives they gambled with, and I realize we are reasoning with immoral psychopaths.</p>
<p>&emsp;How to convince them, I think. None of the others understand. This bastard just wants power, so how do I give it to him? Or how do I make it crumble?</p>
<p>&emsp;Fear. Fear is how you do it, I think.</p>
<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;Endogeny is right behind us&mdash;the Chymaeran black bile. That&apos;s why we&apos;re out of breath. We could see it after we packed up camp this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Bullshit,&quot; he says. The cadets grow uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But do you know anything of how to defeat it? Do any of you know its weakness? How to defend against it? It tore through a whole battalion of Dragon Class cadets in a single night. And you&apos;re all doomed to die if you don&apos;t get our help,&quot; I say. I sow further fear. &quot;All of you are weak. You&apos;d piss your pants before you drew your sword or rifle.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But we can&apos;t risk it!&quot; He says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s a risk you can&apos;t afford to take. Would you rather die in an hour or have a chance to live longer? Kill us, and you lose that knowledge. We&apos;re the only ones that survived it. It will liquidate your forces and dissolve you away just like your families,&quot; I say, making sure my face is adamant with rage and resolve.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No. You&apos;re not the leader here&mdash;&quot; he says, but the cadets overtake his power. Beyond his words, he has nothing. He tries defending the lever, grasping on to it as if it were a lone branch in a torrential river, but their forces overpower them.</p>
<p>&emsp;The portcullis opens, just a hair. The stabbing edges rise from the dirt, just enough for us to crawl under, as their demoted leader is forced away. The cadets draw their weapons, trembling, pointing them at us. The truth is that we&apos;re all just kids that have never seen war, only weapons and training. I doubt any of them have the courage to pull the trigger &mdash; all bark and no bite.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What the hell were you doing?&quot; a voice shouts, its figure emerging from a makeshift bedroom inside the walls. A Dragon-Class cloak shimmers. &quot;I make you second-in-command and you raise hell on a power trip. Send this traitor out of here. Go, force him!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The lower-level cadets drag him like subservient ants. He thrashes. They knock him unconscious. They roll his body beyond the gates and close it, though his arms and legs refuse to move. For a moment, I wonder if he&apos;s dead. Some protest, but the others follow his command.</p>
<p>&emsp;He&apos;s the only one I could expect to be drunk on absolute power. But his face lightens in the moment that he sees us, only to frown when he counts four.</p>

<p>&emsp;&quot;Just so we&apos;re clear, I&apos;m in command here,&quot; Romin tells Jarrett. &quot;This is District Twelve, not District Seven.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. Whatever,&quot; Jarrett says.</p>
<p>&emsp;We sit in a makeshift command tent on the dirt-trodden main path. The stumps of four logs make chairs. A wooden board makes a table.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Where is Valentina?&quot; Romin demands.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She didn&apos;t make it. She&mdash;&quot; Isla starts, but she&apos;s cut off by Romin. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I wasn&apos;t asking you,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Titus.&quot; I notice that he tries to dry out the friendliness from his voice, but it wavers just a little. &quot;What happened to her?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I want to shout the incendiary accusation that waits on my tongue and burns my heart. But I&apos;m slightly better at controlling my anger than he is.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;She didn&apos;t make it, Romin. She saved our lives. It was the only way we survived down there,&quot; I say. &quot;And don&apos;t cut off Isla. Just because you run this boys&apos; club here doesn&apos;t mean you can forget where you came from.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Rank isn&apos;t anything anymore,&quot; he says. His eyes constantly pass between the guards standing at the front of the tent, noticing how they listen in, knowing he must put on a good show regardless of the cost, thinking it&apos;s the only way he can hold on to whatever he has. &quot;Nothing is left of that past world. All we have is this.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s been three days, Romin! It&apos;s way too early to dive into total anarchy. Let us lead together.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He cringes at that last word, as if I were a lesser wolf threatening his leadership of the pack. There is no pack, just a bunch of stranded idiots. &quot;Don&apos;t challenge me. We still don&apos;t know if you&apos;re Chymaerans or not. Don&apos;t forget that,&quot; he says, and a twinge of resentment sounds in his voice that only I can notice, but he hushes that sound in fear that all the others can hear.</p>
<p>&emsp;He looks again to his &apos;guards&apos; in front of the tent &mdash; I notice he pinned two of the Dragon Class rubies from his mark on their chest. I scoff: no matter what, ego and honor always win.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;In fact, I want you to take these three away,&quot; Romin says, pointing to the rest of our surrogate fireteam. His eyes don&apos;t even meet Sylvia&apos;s. I can tell his façade is breaking, and he doesn&apos;t want the others to witness it.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But don&apos;t you know them?&quot; the &apos;guard&apos; asks.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t question my authority. We&apos;ve already established it,&quot; he says. &quot;This cadet will be the one to either prove or deny. If they fail, they&apos;ll be sent back to the lower city.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Understood,&quot; his minion says. The three refuse to protest &mdash; they know the sheer volume of frightened soldiers that would jump at anything to take commands, to feel even a fraction of direction.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Good luck defusing his power trip,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;Romin. You bring shame to the First Blood of the Carmine.&quot; He spits, but Romin&apos;s face is resolute, staring directly at me. New &apos;guards&apos; cycle to the front of the tent, but he dismisses them.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Leave us,&quot; Romin commands. They follow his orders without hesitation.</p>
<p>&emsp;I lean over the table. It tilts in my direction, balanced only by three makeshift legs. I look him dead in the eyes, more certain than I&apos;ve ever been in my life. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin. You know that we&apos;re not Chymaerans. You and I both know this charade isn&apos;t about that.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He doesn&apos;t respond. He&apos;s already made up his mind, and though his bottom lip quivers, he doesn&apos;t want to waver.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;How the fridging hell did you even get here?&quot; I ask him. &quot;You never came to the Academy. We were so worried about you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You left me, just to replace me with them. Am I that replaceable?&quot; he asks. &quot;Am I that forgettable?&quot; Like a toddler abandoned by his parents for several minutes, craving attention.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin. You never came to us. We were separated. What else were we supposed to do? Wait for you? When you don&apos;t even know where we were? We&apos;d die out there&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He slams his fist on the makeshift table. &quot;Shut up,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;ll have to live with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I scoff. &quot;Live with what, Romin?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;But he continues on. &quot;My mission was assigned down in the city. In fact &mdash; we all were. As the only Dragon Class cadet there, the leadership decided that I was in charge. We defend this foothold of the Upper Lands. Against anyone.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So why do you treat us like this? We&apos;ve been friends for years. You explored beyond the walls with me. You saved me from my room, days ago, when I was too depressed to leave. You&apos;re the one who&apos;s acting the impostor.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;To lead men, you have to rule with an iron fist. You have to do the unspeakable things that no one else will do. You have to show that strength to them, that resiliency to moral nature in the interest of protection, and reinforce it in them, so that they never question you. We&apos;ve entered a time of war. There is no Carmine anymore. There is no Merlot. No . . . Valentina,&quot; his voice wavers, but he corrects it as soon as he can. &quot;All that&apos;s left is the wolves and the sheep. And I am their shepherd.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I remember the non-Chymaeran bodies just past the gates, and my stomach twists. &quot;It was you, then. You had those innocent cadets killed! Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because it&apos;s us versus them.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is that supposed to mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It needs to be us versus them. With no them, there&apos;s no us. The enemy needs a face. These weak soldiers need a &apos;them.&apos; And if that means . . .&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Killing innocent cadets? Sentencing them to death just because you&apos;re afraid? Creating a wild witch hunt to stir chaos, and make them need a leader? That makes you a coward.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; Romin says. &quot;It makes me smart. Fear is the strongest emotion, and if my soldiers rest on the precipice of that fear of death, they will never question me. Only then do they find unity.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re just an egotistical coward,&quot; I tell him. I bend over the wooden board, and he stands up in response. &quot;Let us lead together. Please, Romin. You don&apos;t have to do this alone.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I finally have what I&apos;ve always wanted, and you just want to take it away!&quot; His face screws up, as if he&apos;s on the verge of tears. He regains control when his anger wins over, and he hushes his voice before the distant cadets can hear the weakness in his outburst. &quot;I don&apos;t want to have to decide between the both of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t have to, Romin,&quot; I say. &quot;You can have both. You can have leadership and friends. Great leaders are loved.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Great leaders are feared,&quot; he says. A quick onset of panic rises when he notices his minions have turned around, catching him in a moment of weakness. &quot;And I&apos;m sorry I have to do this.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I only manage a single world. &quot;You&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He draws his fist, erupting it across my face at full force in a cheap shot before I can anticipate. I taste iron as I crumple to the ground.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Take this . . . Chymaeran . . . to the prison,&quot; he says, refusing to look me in the eyes as blood spouts from my nose.</p>
<p>&emsp;The guard pauses. &quot;But shouldn&apos;t we just desert them out there? If they&apos;re Chymaerans? That makes no sense.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Just do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;In my anger, I can only manage that single string of words I had been saving to tear at him. Now I can believe it.</p>

<p>&emsp;Hours pass in the temporary holding area beneath the wall. Four cells face each other with two on each side, and two cadets stand watch in the aisle between. They&apos;re unsure what prison guards even do beyond the books they&apos;ve read and the films they&apos;ve seen, so they just idle &mdash; whistling as they pace back and forth.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t have to listen to that bastard,&quot; Jarrett insists. He&apos;s said that for hours. Our voices are the only power we have left, as the amorphous mass of Endogeny gets closer.</p>
<p>&emsp;In the evening, I hear the gate raise just a hair. Scouts approach on horseback. Fortunately, the barred window of my cell faces the empty courtyard, and I overhear their conversation.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Valedictorian wasn&apos;t lying. I saw it . . . whatever it was,&quot; he says, &quot;that mess of black stretching further than my eyes could register. What did he tell us to do? The Dragon Class guy?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He hasn&apos;t said a thing. He told us to just wait here.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I can feel the fear I planted stir across the camp. It grows exponentially with each silent minute. My plan is still working, even though I never expected our incarceration. Most of Romin&apos;s cadets are still awake, shivering in the cold, their eyes sunk in crescents of apprehension. With so many cadets, it will only be minutes before the powder keg erupts.</p>
<p>&emsp;And I can start the fire.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What are we to do,&quot; Sylvia says. She reclines on the stone bed of her cell.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I need you all to play along,&quot; I tell them. &quot;We&apos;re watering the seeds of fear I planted at the gates.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t get any ideas,&quot; the guard says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Or else what, cunt? You gonna kill us?&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;A hundred pounds soaking wet, probably bottom of the class. I could snap you like a twig.&quot; The cadet steps back from the holding cell. &quot;Yeah, that&apos;s what I thought.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I turn to the expanse beyond the window. Their panic is growing. The darker the landscape grows, the faster their fires dull without fuel to stoke them, the more anxiety settles. It&apos;s the perfect time now.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re all going to die! The tar is approaching,&quot; I shout. Most of them jump to their feet, gathering their rifles. &quot;The only ones you have that know anything of that creature are in your prison. And you just sit there, you stupid idiots! You&apos;re doing nothing, just waiting to die!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Shut up!&quot; one of them shouts, voice trembling.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You aren&apos;t trained like Dragon Class. That stupid leader of yours has done nothing to prepare you. He doesn&apos;t care about you.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is this about,&quot; Romin says, stepping forward from his tent.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right. You have no power here,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;Bastard brother in the Carmine.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I can see it!&quot; Isla shouts. She and Sylvia scream in panic. &quot;It&apos;s right at the gates!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;They rush to the gate, stumbling over each other, and several of them are incapacitated in the stampede. The prison guards don&apos;t know what to do. The commotion rises with the dread like baking soda and vinegar, and I turn to the guards.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re weak, pathetic. You need us,&quot; I tell them. &quot;Let us out and I&apos;ll save your life.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I...I can&apos;t...&quot; one of the guards stammers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Like hell you can&apos;t. You need us.&quot; I can feel their uncertainty draw them to the bars with the keys. &quot;That&apos;s right. Turn the lock.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; he says. But just as he reaches for the lock, Romin descends the stairs, furious. An existential dread cramps his fists, and it seems like he&apos;s about to throw up. He kicks the keys away. One guard passes him to run for the stairs. The other twig that tried to free us collapses on his back.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t even think about it!&quot; Romin shouts. &quot;What the hell are you all doing? You&apos;re making everything worse.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re getting out of here. This isn&apos;t a game. These cadets need to prepare or else they&apos;re going to die, you bald-headed twat,&quot; Jarrett sneers.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s time, then,&quot; Romin says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Good,&quot; Jarrett replies, &quot;you finally came to your senses.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No. It&apos;s time to rush the gates,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And let us go,&quot; Jarrett says, but Romin leaves without another word.</p>
<p>&emsp;The keys lie just between Sylvia and Isla&apos;s cell, and Sylvia tries to reach for it, but they rest just beyond her grasp. Isla stares beyond the window, trying to make sense of the landscape. &quot;Gods, it&apos;s actually true, I can see it! It&apos;s right there, getting closer.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Panic is the last thing we need. All we need is to calmly respond,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;Isla, you have thin wrists. Reach for the keys&mdash;&quot; but he&apos;s interrupted by Romin&apos;s voice outside.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s time now, cadets!&quot; he says. He stands atop a makeshift stage of fruit crates. &quot;Now is the time where we fight. The enemy waits at the gates. We must meet them before they destroy us!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is he talking about? Is he talking about going out there?&quot; Sylvia says, as Isla reaches for the keys. She shifts herself. She&apos;s so close.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s suicide,&quot; Jarrett says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;All he wants is to be a martyr. All he wants is glory,&quot; I say, &quot;and he&apos;s about to take a hundred cadets unless we stop him.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Romin beckons with his rallying cry. The cadets respond with nervous cheers, adrenaline eclipsing their fears of death, if only for a moment. They want so badly to be led, to feel a part of something, even if it means until the bitter end, but I refuse to let that happen.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I can&apos;t reach it,&quot; Isla says. &quot;It&apos;s too far.&quot; And then I see a stick just beyond the ground-level window.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Use this,&quot; I tell her. I toss it through the bars, and she grabs for it. She reaches for the key ring, trying to hook it. The rest hold their breath. I watch my friend rally a hundred cadets in martyrdom.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Step forward if you&apos;re courageous. Step back if you&apos;re a coward. This means almost certain death, but you&apos;ll be sacrificing for the betterment of our people, the key tenant of our Academy,&quot; he says. Several step forward. Isla&apos;s arms atrophy.</p>
<p>&emsp;My words can do nothing behind these bars. My heart drops when cadets open the gates. The crowd is divided in two groups of trembling firebrands, about one-to-four, and Romin stirs their emotions further.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ah!&quot; Isla exclaims. The keys are in her hands. She fumbles her fingers against the lock and it opens.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You first. You&apos;re the only one that can stop him,&quot; she tells me. The door clicks, and she throws the iron grate aside. I hear Romin&apos;s cry drown out as it grows further. Endogeny is approaching, and it will spare no one &mdash; not even these cadets with tombstone courage.</p>
<p>&emsp;I break the top of the stairs, heaving, clearing great distance as quickly as my legs will allow me. They&apos;re passing under. The final split is nearly half and half. Hundreds of cadets are going to die just so Romin can feel his last moment of glory. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Stop! Stop, all of you! This isn&apos;t courage or glory. We fight with our minds, not just our hearts!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Only several of them stop, the ones that just broke the line of the gates. I watch their eyes. They see something unspeakable approaching, and then their natural instinct of self-preservation finally kicks in.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Lower the gates!&quot; one cries.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, wait!&quot; the others beyond the walls scream. But it&apos;s too late. The heavy metal gates are already down. Several of them try to climb, to gain whatever height they can as if the floor were molten lava. All the wise can do is watch as their friends trample over each other, regretting their final decision.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You cowards,&quot; Romin shouts. It&apos;s dark, but I can see him weep. &quot;You have no honor. You have no courage! If you die, you will be remembered! You will live forever in the hearts of our people.&quot; But he&apos;s the only one standing that far beyond the walls.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Open the bloody damn gates,&quot; I command. The others hesitate, so I do it myself, just enough that the scrambling cadets can roll through. &quot;Several at a time, or you all will die.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;We can only save twenty before the great cancer Endogeny is too close. My hand trembles on the lever, and I curse Romin for his idiocy in leveraging such a terrible situation on me. When do I lower it? There are still so many that struggle. They&apos;re like rats desperate to escape a flooded drain tunnel. If I don&apos;t lower it now, the rest of us will all die for nothing.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Lower the gates already, it&apos;s going to kill us!&quot; Jarrett shouts, but I&apos;m stuck in indecision.</p>
<p>&emsp;The stranded cadets screech with bloodcurdling cries. I close my eyes, unable to watch the horror as I throw the lever. I hear the cracking of bones. I can hear their screams drown out as the spiked edge of the massive gate lowers on them, while the ones still alive cry, reaching through the bars, resorting back to climbing as they curse me, condemning with the last of their souls as they&apos;re marked for death.</p>
<p>&emsp;Tears crest my eyes, and I fall to my knees. The hate grows stronger, and I want to die here. I couldn&apos;t save them, not all of them. I wish so strongly that the ground could swallow me whole. I anticipate a death so painful that it could repay just a fraction of those lives I&apos;ve sacrificed, wishing I was among them.</p>
<p>&emsp;And then I feel her embrace. Sylvia hugs me. Though her warmth can&apos;t penetrate the depth of my loathing, all I can do is rest there, deprived of the desire to rise from the frostbitten ground, and she raises me.</p>
<p>&emsp;The cadets I saved join her. They stand around me. Hands rest on my shoulders. They thank me for what I&apos;ve done. They pledge their lives to the fight to survive, but even over their voices I can&apos;t refuse to hear the chaos of the soon-to-be-dead; the cacophony of confliction, and so I bury myself further in the dirt.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let me die here,&quot; I plead. But they drag me, away from the lever, away from the walls where twelve cadets&apos; bodies are separated in half, some of their upper halves still crawling as they hold tightly to life, some resigned to their fate, others holding to the top of the gates as they kick lower firebrands off.</p>
<p>&emsp;The last I see is Romin, standing atop a crate like a statue: absolute; galvanized in the strength of his conviction; unyielding though no eyes watch him. He doesn&apos;t hear the screams of the ones he&apos;s stranded. He doesn&apos;t watch them crawl, their arms grow bashed and bloody from thrashing against the iron lattice.</p>
&quot;Remember me,&quot; I hear him say, but nobody watches. He dies a statue with no etchings, without a name to remember. I close my eyes before the bile drowns his life and his legacy."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"SevenWordSummary":"Titus caves to his grief.","AutoNameFull":30,"ActNum":1,"ChapterOverride":"","ChapterPart":14,"ChapterFull":14,"VerboseOverride":"","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":30,"Style":"Firebrand","Perspective":"Titus","Index":47,"Label":"Check","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"46","Synopsis":"

<p>&emsp;They said the iron gates dissolved in a matter of minutes. I refused to turn my head and watch ever since that moment I closed my eyes and bowed my head. </p>
<p>&emsp;I feel so weak. Weak and afraid. Afraid and unworthy to play the executioner in a world of sheer brutality. A single spasm of muscle and I ended the lives of two dozen cadets, condemning to the fate of death before Endogeny could consume them, and I wish I were among them.</p>
<p>&emsp;I refuse to move while the cadets I saved fight for me. That confidence was all a lie: we know nothing of this horrifying amalgamation, and just like Romin, I am nothing but a coward, unwilling to fight, detached from the drive to live for myself.</p>
<p>&emsp;My sins will never be forgiven. Every time I close my eyes I&apos;m met with the face of my dying father, and I remember our final argument. Gods &mdash; I was such a child. And Ellie&apos;s cry, pleading for me to save her when I was powerless and weak, as weak as I am now &mdash; there was nothing I could do for her. Now the two dozen other fatalities join them; they need no faces for me to place their anguish to the bitter end.</p>
<p>&emsp;My body tingles with the desire for motion. All it needs is just a spark, and I search for it within me. How terrible am I, to speak words of courage and how badly these Cadets need us, only to cower here and do nothing? If there&apos;s an afterlife, I don&apos;t deserve it. No acts of valor denote the bookends of my story. I can only redeem a fraction of what I&apos;ve taken if I give myself wholly. There will be no peace otherwise.</p>
<p>&emsp;I draw Valentina&apos;s Vermillion rifle. I loaded it moments before, considering pulling the trigger when Sylvia wasn&apos;t looking, but the thoughts of leaving her in her last moments weeping over the body of a friend who killed himself is too much to bear.</p>
<p>&emsp;So I decide I won&apos;t live for myself anymore. I steady the rifle to the sound of battle cries beyond the barracks, and the memory of distant dreams harmonize between my ears, singing that I was born to this world as nothing more than a sacrifice. There need be no spirit when it impedes the soulless machine of battle. The pain of sorrow can no longer hurt me. The pleasures of love pass through me as phantoms of a life I don&apos;t deserve. I&apos;ve always lived just to die for others, and now in the final chapter, I must steel myself in those vows.</p>
<p>&emsp;My ears ring. All I can hear is the sound of my own heartbeat, and all I can feel is the trembling ground beneath my feet with every explosion. For once my mind is entirely clear, unrestrained by primal fear. Endogeny pours through the melted gates like molten magma rock, a conscious mass of blackened innards, bone, and tendons, splitting and merging in an orchestrated cacophony. Explosions rip chunks that launch skyward, leaving craters that mend in seconds. The front lines keep dragging backwards, driving us up the hill. </p>
<p>&emsp;The mass is conscious and horrifying. It contains the memories of all the lives it&apos;s taken. When it splits into humanoid projections, armed with obsidian swords composed of the hardest parts of its victims, it seems as if each cadet can discern the faces, and I soon learn that hesitation is its strength.</p>
<p>&emsp;So many figures withdraw from Endogeny like hail from a storm cloud. They grow legs when they need to go faster; additional arms when engaged in swordsmanship. My hands are steady when I draw the rifle, finger posed on the trigger at the perfect angle. I pull when the sights line on a blackened torso. They crumble like wax idols, dissolving into the dirt, waiting to be remerged with its greater form, too small to be capable of motion. I pull the bolt back and chamber another round, just as the front lines are pushed a hundred feet from the stone walls.</p>
<p>&emsp;The great mass shapes all its victims in flesh before the living, a master weaver of sinew and bone; a sculptor with skill as divine as the Chymaeran Gods. It reaches within to the memory of every victim to project the images of everyone that cadet has ever loved.</p>
<p>&emsp;I watch Isla&apos;s hands tremble as Delvin and Vera appear before her. Flushed in false color like glazed tar pottery, I&apos;m surprised when these projections try to resist, but no matter what, Endogeny collapses them to reform again, endless as the waves against the shore of Blackwater&apos;s lakes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t hesitate! Hesitation is death,&quot; I shout, but I cannot hear the sound of my own voice, and I&apos;m sure not many listen either. The lines draw closer. I know these are my final moments. </p>
<p>&emsp;I want to die away from my friends, somewhere they won&apos;t find me, to an enemy that leaves its victims with no recognition.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Pull back! Pull back,&quot; the Cadets shout, but I don&apos;t listen. Our faith tells us of the Reservoir of Souls, where the dead reconvene before being reborn into a new life. You can only be freed when you entirely release the attachments of your past life, and I pray if I succumb in a final act of valor that I might be found worthy to see the ones I love again.</p>
<p>&emsp;I want to come home to my mother. I want to feel the warmth of her embrace again. I want to cry and tell her how hard this life has been, how sorry I am that I was too weak to protect her daughter. I want to apologize to my father. I want us to be a family again, wherever that future world takes us, no matter how long we might wait there in the Reservoir, how many words and tears it might take to settle the woes of this endless nightmare.</p>
<p>&emsp;And I feel my grasp loosen on the rifle, the last piece of a cherished friend who waits for me on the other side. I can feel her spirit in every stroke of the bolt, the jarring crash of the debris that killed her in every blast. The concept of death horrifies me, no matter how much I galvanize myself against the values of life, and I hate that feeling. I hate the self-preservation that draws the breath when I hold it as long as I can. Will it be painless? Did poor Delvin feel nothing when it took his legs and he was beyond the point of no return?</p>
<p>&emsp;Endogeny has focused on me. I&apos;ve disappeared from Sylvia, Isla, and Jarrett in the scrum of two hundred cadets, the closest on the front lines, and I know now is the time to give in. I can pray that I&apos;ll see them on the other side: there&apos;s no chance for anyone.</p>
<p>&emsp;Endogeny erects three masses, drawing a ten-foot circle around my feet, closing me in. It chisels them in convulsions of muscle and sinew, drawing the memories of my beloved that succumbed to its influence.</p>
<p>&emsp;Their guise adapts from memory. Endogeny searches the neurons of minds that recall me for emotion of the strongest memories. One rises with the cloak of a city guard, strong with muscle. A mess of black sharpens into a prickled beard. The figure is unfinished, but not by accident; the arm crumbles off as if it were a statue mistakenly blemished by its creator.</p>
<p>&emsp;To the side rises Romin. Further right rises Valentina, their faces just slightly off, enough that it twists my stomach and sends shivers down my spine, as if they were formed by an amateur artist who had only seen them in passing, who knew nothing of proportions.</p>
<p>&emsp;They extend their arms to me. We can be free, forever, they speak, without words. I feel my hands loosen further on the rifle. I feel myself drawn towards their embrace, wanting so badly to succumb, to give my life for one last feeling of warmth to send me off. </p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s a gift to die here, and I feel my breath falter. My heart slows. Endogeny presses another ten feet up the hill, and I&apos;m left far behind in the circle.</p>
&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; I tell them. &quot;I&apos;m sorry I couldn&apos;t save you. I don&apos;t deserve this mercy.&quot; The circle draws closer as they approach. The rifle falls from my hands, and just when I think I&apos;m going to lose myself entirely, color begins to flush in the shadowed face of my father."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":3,"SevenWordSummary":"Endogenous Clint.

<p>&emsp;The circle halts. Endogeny freezes around me. I can see a tension in its mass, some force resilient against the command to consume. </p>
<p>&emsp;The form of my father resists. The colors grow sharper. The cloak saturates, and his arm grows from bone. He twinges, as if the conscious anguish metastasizes in a physical struggle for command of his form.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You deserve . . . everything . . . of the world I couldn&apos;t give you,&quot; he mutters, as his true colors flush entirely, and he detaches from Endogeny. His skin is smooth, no longer worn with age. An iron sword carved from memories of his time as a guard is tensioned in his hand, and the gift of a locket I gave him as a child holds around his neck.</p>
<p>&emsp;He&apos;s no older than I am. He looks around twenty. Cords of finely-honed muscle brazen his arms, and the past design of the Dragon Class mark pours from his shoulders.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t die an early death and live the rest of it in regret. Don&apos;t make the same mistake as me,&quot; he pleads. &quot;In death I will protect you the way I never did. I hope it &mdash; amounts &mdash; to anything,&quot; he says, slashing at the forms of Romin and Valentina, decapitating them. They fall back to the uphill river of black tar.</p>
<p>&emsp;The creatures turn to me. I&apos;m a hundred feet inside the bounds of Endogeny. They take the faces of any victim I&apos;ve ever seen: the postman that greeted me every day at the door. All my beloved Academy instructors. Valentina and Romin. Even the face of my mother &mdash; and so I realize it ravaged the graveyards for flesh as fuel, too.</p>
<p>&emsp;But the postmortem specter of my father braces. I can feel the immense pain he takes to keep this form apart from Endogeny, and I know it won&apos;t hold forever. I watch him raise his hand as the tar river slims in front of me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I reach for the rifle only to find it has already been taken. He extends his new arm to clasp my hand. In the firmness of my grasp, it molds to take the form of the sword he bought me when I began my training at the Academy almost fifteen years ago, the sword I threw out in anger when our arguments boiled over into rage, when I began to hate him so much that I stopped visiting him for leisure.</p>
<p>&emsp;Bone and sinew contract to form the appearance of carbon steel. The weapon is brutal and resilient, literally forged of love and memory, far stronger and sharper than any weapon I&apos;ve ever used.</p>
<p>&emsp;The projection of my father and I stand together. Our movements play in an immaculate last dance of slashes. The sword I hold floats with the lightness of my family&apos;s love. The sound of every slice graces with rekindled memories of my mother&apos;s voice. When it connects with the black wax of dark dopplegangers, it slices through with the sharpness of my father&apos;s lessons, the strength he taught me before sadness divided us. Every step is another memory, and as a blade dancer, I can feel an entire life flash before my eyes.</p>
<p>&emsp;I watch the colors of my young father fade. His strength over the conscious mass weakens as I re-approach the edge of the tar, so close to breaking through, although the creatures mutate faster. The last memory of Clint and I reduce the masses to their earthly graves &mdash; just enough impedance before they reform ahead of us, and we&apos;re slicing at them all over again.</p>
<p>&emsp;But that detachment still holds within me. In the beauty of this last moment, I can&apos;t think of it as anything more than a last fruitless effort. The line of freedom is still so far away, and what is it for? Just for another hour alive to succumb later. I can see Sylvia slashing from the other end, out of arrows, reduced to a scavenged sword, and she cries out for me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I still can&apos;t feel any reason to live for myself. The love of others is beautiful, but not persuasive enough. I can feel the exhaustion flood my muscles. I know I cannot keep this up forever. Ninety percent of the cadets have been extinguished. The remaining are stranded atop the perimeter walls, their high ground a stranded island surrounded by seas of liquid charcoal.</p>
<p>&emsp;I see Isla&apos;s face appear among the tar-bound doubles, and a piece of my soul fractures when I sever her neck, slicing like butter with no hardness of a spine. I&apos;ve lost her. And when Jarrett joins Romin, I feel the spirit of my resistance dissolve.</p>
<p>&emsp;My hands are frail and weak. Endogeny gains strength as my father fades. Sylvia is still so far away, and I hope I can apologize to her in another life. </p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m not strong enough for this battle.</p>
<p>&emsp;The will to live for myself is too weak.</p>
<p>&emsp;So my slashes grow sloppy, my dodges slow like moving through molasses, and obsidian blades begin to slice my skin.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that I fall to the ocean of tar, to become another face that haunts the living.</p>
<p>&emsp;My father stands over me, reminding me of the times we practiced in the back yard of the house with training equipment. So many rounds after the passing of my mother he would stand over me in resentment, feeling pleasure in letting me saturate in that pain, as if I could feel the hurt of loss for him. But here his body covers me, no color left to distinguish him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry I couldn&apos;t save you,&quot; Clint says, before his mouth seals over with the tar, robbing him of any further words. He dissolves back to nothingness as I feel Endogeny overtake me, the heaviness like water torture with a weighted blanket, and I try to force my last thoughts to be of the life after this one.</p>
I catch a final image of Sylvia standing over me before my face is overtaken. With no breath, mouth, or nose to shout, I watch as it overtakes her. The viscosity collapses her alongside me, and we lay there, entombed in Endogeny just as Valentina laid once beneath the wreckage."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Summit","SevenWordSummary":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Fifteen","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Fifteen","ActNum":1,"ChapterOverride":"","ChapterPart":15,"ChapterFull":15,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Style":"Firebrand","Perspective":"Titus","Index":49,"Label":"No Label","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"48","Synopsis":"Titus reaches the end of his journey.","NextPublish":"<$custom:NextPublish","VerboseID":"1.15","VerboseOverride":"","Links":{"Wattpad":"https://www.wattpad.com/user/SavantGuarde","Personal":"https://autononymous.io/authors-and-stories/savantguarde/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand/firebrand-1-15","RoyalRoad":"https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/109661/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand-book-one","AO3":"https://archiveofourown.org/works/63835228/chapters/164389339","DeviantArt":"https://www.deviantart.com/savant-guarde"},"DocName":"

<p>&emsp;In the conscious collective mind of Endogeny, there&apos;s a part of me still there, a part of my blood. It refuses the connection like oil and water, but in those places it connects, I feel the consciousness of a million humans.</p>
<p>&emsp;I can feel memories, all their last moments of horror, attachments of what it feels like to love and hate. I can feel the nameless essence of who they all were, as our memories have all been joined together. My connection is weak but I still search for her, so many faces like the young girl I raised, though none are Ellie. A part of me feels relief that she&apos;s free of this place, hoping that she&apos;s still alive somewhere, and I pray she finds the strength to live on.</p>
<p>&emsp;My brain sends signals to my arms and legs, and I&apos;m surprised when I still feel them there. The only sensation that holds me to this world is a hand still clasped in mine, and I feel the incredible strength of her Essence, coupled with a part of myself that&apos;s unpalatable to Endogeny.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s as if I can feel divinity flood my circuits. I recall dreams of holy blood. And for the first time in my life, I feel the true strength of my Essence in physical form, resisting the black bile and refusing to merge. </p>
<p>&emsp;Endogeny gives me a vision as it tries to overtake me. I&apos;m trapped chest-deep in a black tar of gnashing faces that have no lungs to scream. The humanoid faces cover the floor, walls, and ceiling. I try to resist by pushing myself out with my arms, only to find that the scar on my wrist is tethered with a glowing, crimson thread, attached somewhere beyond the layers of black bile above me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I use the thread to free myself, climbing it like the ropes at the Academy fitness course though the bile impedes my motion. I&apos;m nearly free when I hear the resonance of something that almost sounds electric.</p>
<p>&emsp;Something angular and unnatural protrudes from the amalgamation of flesh: large, obsidian, and planar with sharp, slender limbs.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So many millions I&apos;ve brought to this unity. But you still resist.&quot; Its voice crackles through that same electric resonance like changing radio frequencies. Its thick, shelled armor is an extension of its body: the edges contoured with gold, and its triangle of eyes glows beneath the surface of the thick shell covering its face. &quot;I am Endogeny, demigod of the Chymaera: called back to this world by a Mask of the Gods, to act on the only purpose for which I was created.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A Mask?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Mask. The divine conduit between the will of the Gods and the impermanent life of the Humans, the righteous conductor holding a fraction of their power. Have you truly never heard of this?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;It stabs its slender arm into one of the faces, withdrawing what might be thoughts or memories. &quot;Look at that. Not a single human in this age knows the truth. Are you all just ignorant?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why are the Chymaera attacking Blackwater?&quot; I ask, still trying to free myself as Endogeny watches. &quot;What does this frozen wasteland have that you could ever possibly value? Is it the powers of the Afterlife?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I have no knowledge of what demand compels me. I am only a force of nature. Yet, for the first time, I have a master of mixed heritage &mdash; with only half the blood of Chymaeran divinity.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;The demigod approaches.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The other half is just like yours. Human.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;It reaches to try and sever the thread with a swipe of one of its arms, but it only pulls me out further. The thread refuses to give. Something else does first, and so Endogeny cries in anguish. Part of its arm is missing, and as it wills it to grow back from the conscious bile, it cries out.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is this? All these Essence-less cattle, yet you&apos;re nothing like them. A connection to the Gods,&quot; it says. &quot;You have no business here. Get out!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The scrum of eyeless faces condense as Endogeny disappears into the walls. It feels as if I&apos;m being digested: the bitter smell of death and rot as these amalgamated fleshy intestines try to digest me like a swallowed coin. But the thread tensions. I feel myself withdrawn from this viscous grave like an ingrown hair torn from flesh. Layers upon layers of arms and legs and faces of living muck pass me, and when I break the surface, I sprawl atop a large mound of dark, ashen clay, surrounded by an infinite crystalline plane of obsidian.</p>
<p>&emsp;An uncountable crowd of silhouettes stumble across the crystalline desert: lost souls waiting to be reborn. Somewhere far in the distance is the only non-reflective surface, just like in all the prophetic tales of life after death: the void of rebirth.</p>
<p>&emsp;I try to run for it, but I find this thread is attached somewhere far above me. My feet leave the mound of conscious clay and I swing forwards before returning to the point from whence I tried to escape, only to find a second thread extending down somewhere else.</p>
<p>&emsp;My ethereal form indents in the muck. Next to me is a young girl dressed in immaculate, white clothes, holding on to the other end of the thread. She lifts her wrist. My thread extends upwards to infinity, but so does hers. I can only imply ours are tethered together.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A million souls held for ransom, incapable of being reborn until the moment they&apos;re all released,&quot; she says. &quot;That&apos;s the power of Endogeny.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;This is not the world I remember. This must all be a vision. I look around. The sky is missing, replaced with planar surfaces of obsidian at an infinite distance, as if I float from within a hollow geode lit by the faintest purple light. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;This is the Reservoir,&quot; I say. &quot;The true afterlife.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes. But your time has not come yet. And if your stubbornness persists the same way as the one that came before you &mdash; all you will ever be is a visitor.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;A visitor to death? I gave myself to die &mdash; Losing my family, my friends, all the ones I care for, even the one I love . . . it was too much to bear alone,&quot; I say. &quot;And I&apos;m done.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You made a pact! You gave up your divine gift for this, so you don&apos;t get to back out now,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There is no gift. And there was no pact. I was reborn just like all these lonely souls,&quot; I say. &quot;I deserve the freedom to die. This life was miserable: grinding hard for success at the Academy just for it all to be thrown away. For what? I hated this life!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But you bartered for it. You made a deal with me for another chance to make things right. Do you even remember where you came from?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I was an orphan, found by my grandfather Everett beyond the walls.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What parents abandon their child beyond the walls? How would you not freeze in seconds? There is nothing that lives out there. You know that, yet you refuse to accept it. I can only assume that piece of myself I sent protected you until the time was right.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then where else do I come from? Why would Everett lie?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You were reborn from the soil of that shallow grave. You were kept alive by our deal, threaded to a piece of me. Your promise was to fix Mother Khiras&apos; mistake in exchange for a second wind. Did you really forget it all? Did my divinity not forestall the effects of rebirth?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s your failure,&quot; I tell her. &quot;It&apos;s your fault that I forgot all of that. I lived as full a life as I could. But my friends are dead; my family is dead; my sister is missing; the entire city and all that remains of humanity is reduced to a rotting mass of flesh. I lost everything! Gods above . . . or here, or wherever they are, have you even seen the suffering it&apos;s taken to get here?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just a daughter of the races&apos; Gods. I cannot see all the affairs of mortals like they can. I simply exist until I&apos;m called to take their place.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And this purpose made you send me to suffer?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No. That purpose was mother Khiras&apos;s ignorance. She preyed upon another guilt-ridden Mask of the Gods with the same offer. Rebirth is a cleansing process that purges the vitriol of past lives, but mother Khiras used him for her own purpose, allowing his to persist, letting him cycle over and over until the perfect end pleased both of them. But that perfect end never came.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So you gave me the same curse. You&apos;re sick.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You were the one that asked me for it. You pleaded me for it: you even pleaded to go with me, persuading me to escape the ennui of a meaningless infinity as a Goddess&apos; child. You told me how much I would suffer in mortal flesh, how much it hurt when you passed on. But you promised me it was worth it; how much you loved your father and mother; your sister; the entire experience of life no matter how much it hurt you and left you for dead. So who do I speak to now? Do you lie just like all the other mortals that came before you, brokering deals with the divine for a life to squander?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I spent an entire life since that moment never giving up, even when I should have, yet it still broke me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then I guess it&apos;s luck that keeps you alive. My blessing saved you. Divine energy made you unpalatable to Endogeny.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The slack in the thread tensions. I feel the vibrations of something far beyond this realm: the first sensation of touch I&apos;ve experienced since I visited here.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And among the living, you&apos;re no longer welcome here. Your mission is to be the infinity that cancels out that other malignant force of infinity.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then how can I ever be done if it never ends?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;By cultivating the only thing your opponent lost along the way,&quot; she says. &quot;The reason I thought you would be different. The reason I thought you could liberate reality from this endless stalemate, a stalemate that even the Gods are powerless and blind to.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;The slack begins to viciously tug at my wrist. I look up to find that a thousand other threaded figures suspend from the obsidian sky like flies wrapped by spiders.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;This is the beginning of a long journey. And those are all the failed outcomes you have yet to leave behind.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I try to resist as the thread as it jostles my weightless form. &quot;How can I end this? How can I ever be free?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The same way you find the end of a circular path. Your journey had a beginning on this circle. There may be no edges to mark your progress, but that which begins must always have an end. You are the only being alive not controlled by fate: a mortal with infinite paint, yet a limited canvas. And you will die forever unless you answer the question he forgot to ask . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Her radiant eyes pierce mine with a final glance.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot; . . . How can the greatest work of art in all existence ever be complete?&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;I expect to find myself deposited in the foxholes of the foothills when I awake at the end of the thread. My mouth is no longer bitter with natural taste of iron and dirt. There&apos;s no biting cold to freeze craters of mud as unsealed coffins for mass burial, but a peaceful warmth, and when I open my eyes to try and lift myself from the softness of this place I&apos;ve been carried, there is only gold and white.</p>
<p>&emsp;My muscles ache with atrophy. It feels like a training day, as if I&apos;m flooded with the soreness of a full-body Academy workout, and when I try to lift my legs from the blanket wrapping me in a warm embrace, something heavy resists my right leg.</p>
<p>&emsp;I let a small groan escape the grimace tensioned in my lips: flexing everything to mitigate the pain, I&apos;m unable to pull myself from this barricade of sheets. I test every muscle in my body. The pin-and-needle response of tingling means it&apos;s there, and I try to pulse the blood back through my veins, waking the whole rest of my body to catch up with my conscious mind.</p>
<p>&emsp; I whistle when I draw a full breath through my chapped lips. I can finally remember the circumstances that brought me here, and it all comes rushing back to me. Clint. Ellie. Valentina and Romin. Sylvia buried beneath Endogeny, and now it&apos;s just me, alone in a white room, staring at the ceiling while the warmest breeze I&apos;ve ever felt dances in the drapes.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Gone . . . all gone,&quot; I say, and I want to cry so badly, but I&apos;m so parched of water that my body refuses to waste any of it. I can only cry through whatever lonely words my lungs will offer to the empty, humid air; pleading for death as if that little girl still listens at the other end of the thread. I put the last of my energy into any muscle that will heed my call. I drag myself to the side of the bed, and once I pass the threshold of soft comfort, I slide off the edge, crashing to the floor.</p>
<p>&emsp;The cloaked figure at the end of the bed jolts from slumber, wearing garments that belong to the Afterlife&apos;s Royal Guard. I find the very premise of my value to the divine acolytes of the Afterlife to be too absurd to believe, let alone the fact that one of their own would be assigned to oversee my recovery. But when the stranger withdraws the hood that brought them to lightless slumber, I find she is not a stranger after all, but the last person that entombed herself in Endogeny along with me.</p>
<p>&emsp;She speaks my name in a dazed panic, finding my upper body crumpled against the floor and the edge of the bed with my legs still dangling upright: my naked body atrophied of muscle and overcome with a rash that covers much of it. Her dark hair brushes my bare chest as she bends down to lift me in her arms, and I feel so humiliated and weak. She deposits me on the bed so she can bury her head in my chest, too broken yet to form a sentence, and I let her cry for the both of us, tracing my trembling fingers through her hair since my body has no warmth to offer her. </p>
<p>&emsp;We rest there for what feels like hours. It&apos;s how long it takes for her to conjure the first words, alive in an Afterlife where we still cannot see the ones we cherish.</p>
<p>&emsp;Hearing my heartbeat reassures her that I&apos;m still here. &quot;After all we lost . . . I&apos;m not letting you go like them,&quot; she says, mumbling the words into my sternum.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I thought it was over,&quot; I say. &quot;But you were there alongside me. It swallowed us together &mdash; how come you aren&apos;t hurt like I am?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because Endogeny never touched me. And when it washed over you, trying to consume your life and Essence, to assimilate you, to rob you of every feature I cherish . . . I tried everything to free you. To pull you from it. To cover you with my body so that it might ignore the both of us. But after all I tried, it didn&apos;t matter &mdash; it gave up on you on its own.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The dream returns to me. I look at the birthmark on my wrist.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The thread,&quot; I mutter. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The what?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Nothing. Just a dream,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But then the Afterlife found us. Said something about pure blood, and then they took us into the city. And then Ullrich was there. He spoke of our potential&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Ullrich? As in . . . the Grandmaster?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right. You shared a stage with him. And he said we were special compared to the ones that died, that there was something inside us, and he extended an offer that I accepted for the two of us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;His word choice bothers me, but I assume she misspoke.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What offer?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He remembered you from graduation. That our fireteam was in the highest echelon of the Academy. He said that we were meant to join the Afterlife&apos;s Royal Guard, to join with the other Dragon-Class cadets in a mission to strike back against the Chymaera beyond the walls. To literally serve the Gods like they do!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And you just accepted this without thinking about it?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The question catches her off-guard. She lifts her head from my chest and meets my eyes with her crimson rings, finding disbelief in my skepticism. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You just accepted this proposal right away. Without time to grieve, or metabolize this, or process it in any way, or to ask me? It&apos;s been how many days?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Two. And I&apos;ve been here for almost all of it, besides swearing in.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Swearing in?&quot; I scoff. &quot;I thought it&apos;d be an eventuality, that at least it was an &apos;eventual yes&apos; or something like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There was no reason not to, and with the path we were following before all this, it was only a continuation of that.&quot; She wipes her eyes, taking a moment to metabolize this discomfort between us. &quot;I don&apos;t know. I just thought you&apos;d be ecstatic about this opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t have room for that feeling right now. All I have is grief. For Romin. For Valentina. For my father, my sister, for Vera and Jarrett and Delvin, and . . . I haven&apos;t told you yet, but my father died right in front of me. He died in my arms in my childhood home, trying to save his daughter!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&mdash;I didn&apos;t know that. I&apos;m sorry,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;It bothers me. &quot;How can you just move on like this? All these people you love. Can&apos;t we take some time together to just process this if we&apos;re building the strength to live on? Well, no. I guess we can&apos;t, if you went ahead and signed your life away.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I was never in a place to experience . . . that. Not once. Not ever. And I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever really had that.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What, family?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I was never chosen like you were, Titus. Maybe your mother made me feel like a part of your family before she died, but then they tossed me to the streets at eighteen, and I was only financially saved by the Academy, by our rank, by riding the coattails of you and Romin and Valentina!&quot; She tensions her hands around the sheets. &quot;I don&apos;t have any other family with them gone. I never did. Only the four of us, and with them gone, all I have is you. And I was certain, so certain you&apos;d be willing to take this leap with me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I just don&apos;t understand why it doesn&apos;t bother you. It just seems inhuman to want to move on so quickly. Don&apos;t you feel anything?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I am sad. I assure you, but when I thought I lost everything &mdash; you, the others, I just felt this panic inside me that was so much stronger than grief. This fear that overwhelmed any inkling of that sadness: that same feeling when I was on the streets; when the older kids in the orphanage did those horrible things to us, and even more so to me . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Sylvia,&quot; I say. I draw her closer to me and embrace her with whatever warmth I can muster.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And it was just like everything else didn&apos;t matter,&quot; she sobs. &quot;I was petrified. I was actually a PART of something for so long, not having to think about what it felt like being on the outside again, and I remembered that feeling, sitting alone in that room before you might visit me, feeling so distant and vacant like I came from nowhere, only to be a soulless thing with no more autonomy to move than one of those training dummies . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It must have been hard,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And I just knew that I had to never feel like that again, no matter the cost, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I do know,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel the wetness from her eyes seep into the covers. I brush her hair to the side the same way I did when we were alone together in that terrible place, and it slowly calms her. </p>
<p>&emsp;My voice cracks when I muster the words from my dry mouth. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;As long as I last, I&apos;ll be here,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;She pauses for a moment, and just like every time before, a part of me fears those three words will rise from either of us. We&apos;ve spent our lives saying everything but as if it were some dangerous incantation, even though our connection is so far beyond them.</p>
<p>&emsp;So I say a different three.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll be here,&quot; I tell her.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll be here for you too,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;ll consider it. Probably end up taking the same oath, but I need time,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
Several minutes pass before her breaths return to a calm rhythm and she lifts herself from my chest. She gathers her things together, mentioning that she has the first responsibilities of her service to attend to today, leaving me with a few sweet words before she breaks the threshold of the door. It&apos;s only moments after Sylvia departs that the Grandmaster Ullrich surprises me with his presence: not only to extend the offer, but to surprise me by asking for something else."},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"The Grandmaster","SevenWordSummary":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Sixteen","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Sixteen","ActNum":1,"ChapterOverride":"","ChapterPart":16,"ChapterFull":16,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Style":"Firebrand","Perspective":"Titus","Index":52,"Label":"No Label","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"51","Synopsis":"Titus encounters Ullrich for a second time.","NextPublish":"<$custom:NextPublish","VerboseID":"1.16","VerboseOverride":"","Links":{"Wattpad":"https://www.wattpad.com/user/SavantGuarde","Personal":"https://autononymous.io/authors-and-stories/savantguarde/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand/firebrand-1-16","RoyalRoad":"https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/109661/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand-book-one","AO3":"https://archiveofourown.org/works/63835228/chapters/164389456","DeviantArt":"https://www.deviantart.com/savant-guarde"},"DocName":"

<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ve been getting a lot better, son, and it&apos;s only been a day. That&apos;s the power of the Afterlife. Of our resources,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Do you not remember me?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Your face is everywhere,&quot; I tell him. My voice is hoarse after only a couple words with Sylvia, so all I can manage is a whisper. &quot;Ullrich Valensend. The highest emissary of the Afterlife. I shared a stage with you at graduation.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He scratches his dark, salt-and-pepper beard before brushing his jet-black pompadour to the side, revealing several streaks of undyed silver. His face wrinkles with a smile against worn frown lines, drawing his hands in the pockets of white-and-gold clothes that conceal all of his skin. &quot;A rousing speech you gave, there, valedictorian,&quot; he says. &quot;You gave hope and spirit to all those graduates. You might be the reason they saved us from the Chymaera.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I wish I could have done more. Our people survived that attack. And for the ones we lost, you can all live in their honor.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Honor,&quot; Ullrich says. It sounds like he laughs, but continues with a cough. &quot;Yes. They were very honorable in their purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But the civilians &mdash; did you save any of them?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They perished. Endogeny was far too strong for them. They have no Essence like us, gifted from the Gods. And that &apos;us&apos; is what brings me to the reason I&apos;m here, Titus, because all of this: Essence transfusion; the insistence of Sylvia; a warm bed and a seat in the Afterlife; all of this is not free, and we didn&apos;t bring you here so you could give up. Despite what those rustbloods down below think, we don&apos;t just worship the gods. We all work. And with the Essence potential that sets you and your girlfriend aside from your colleagues in the Academy, you have a special opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;It looks as if he expects me to leap in the air, throw the covers off and dance on my aching bones, predicating his next words with joy, but the heart doesn&apos;t heal anywhere close to that fast. &quot;I can&apos;t pivot that quickly in all this grief. Gods above . . . minutes ago, I was begging for death to finish me off.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But now you have a reason to live on, Titus. I was exactly like you, once. I see myself in you, and do you know how I got to this point? Do you know where I came from?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not at all. Except that they said it was like you came from nowhere, with exactly the right words for everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I&apos;m good with words. I&apos;ve had lifetimes to practice,&quot; he says. &quot;The Essence of the Afterlife has kept me alive for more than a hundred years, and before that, I explored this world as a Mask of the Gods. As the firstborn child to the king of Northaven, I was betrayed and cast aside by my own family. But I still had the divine birthright. So I carried on, and when Northaven fell to the Chymaera, my wife and I moved to Blackwater. We had a family of two children. We lived beyond the walls in peace for a while, but even there, the Chymaera tried to attack my family.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It just never ends, that suffering . . . &quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It never does. I saved them so many times, yet once, I faltered and lost it all. And yet I still stand here today right in front of you, because I still believe there is something to save.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Maybe I don&apos;t understand it yet, the way that he does, so I humble myself.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;How do you go on when you&apos;ve lost it all, when there&apos;s no way back?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t. And anybody who tells you to move on is a pathetic fool, Titus. There is no price too high for redemption. And if you have to pay with blood, you will fight a glorious and honest battle. Being forced to try again and again is what saved me. Death was no longer an option, like you think it is for you. Sometimes there is a way back, and that attitude is what got me to champion the Afterlife, reshaping all of Blackwater into something better.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then why do you bother with someone like me?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because I think everyone who fights for all and asks for so little deserves the world,&quot; he says. &quot;Especially if they&apos;re special like us. You&apos;re not like the rustbloods. That girl of yours didn&apos;t save you: you saved yourself, because you had enough Essence. Do you know why we call this place the Afterlife?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Because you commune with the Gods themselves? Because your prayers bring sustenance to all of Blackwater?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, gods below . . . it&apos;s because we reach higher than that,&quot; Ullrich says. &quot;And I want you to defend that dream with us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What is it the Afterlife dreams of?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They dream of power and peace. And they might not know it, but for me, it&apos;s enough Essence to bring me back to that golden age,&quot; Ullrich adds. He gestures to someone beyond the door, another Royal Guard, carrying neatly-folded threads of the Royal Guard that look strangely familiar. &quot;I want you &mdash; no, you&apos;re going to &mdash; join me in this sacred mission.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;His acolyte sets them on my lap, and I lift my hands from beneath the covers. The texture&apos;s the same as Sylvia&apos;s uniform: impossibly perfect in their stitching and warmly infused with Essence. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re having a service today to remember the sacrifices it&apos;s taken to keep that dream alive. I want you to speak to all the . . . &apos;honor&apos;,  it took, for us to get to this point.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That, I can manage,&quot; I tell him, and he puts his hands on my shoulders. </p>
<p>&emsp;My heart still longs for the ones whom I never got to say goodbye. I decide I&apos;ll speak to their honor, if it&apos;s the last thing I do, and if I find my ambitions rise higher, I will serve the divine quest to live on for the ones I love. Something makes me uncomfortable putting on the uniform, but here and now under this pressure, I don&apos;t think I have the time. I pray I&apos;ll be able to find it later without a choice.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Come with me. You&apos;re not aware yet of what you and I are capable of. Together, in our endless struggle, I&apos;d say we have more power than the very gods.&quot; He extends his hand to offer his strength, and I can tell he feels a certain pleasure in how he arranges words. &quot;Walk alongside me, and you&apos;ll help me in my quest to return to that past.&quot;</p>

<p>&emsp;&quot;Where is everyone? Is the Afterlife always this empty?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course not,&quot; one of the three escorts says. The light hurts my eyes when I break the threshold of the infirmary&apos;s doors, and I shield them with my pallid wrist. The uniform I wear is unbecoming of the weakness I exude: the perfectly-woven obsidian threads in cacophony with my tangle of messy hair and unkempt beard; my white flesh contrasting the color of a population that spends much of their time basking in the radiant light, even if their hands aren&apos;t calloused and dirty like the ones that toil below.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Then where are they?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;He gestures toward the shining center of the city.</p>
<p>&emsp;It takes a moment for my eyes to accommodate the vast distance. For so long I&apos;ve only looked at close things: faces, impressive infirmary meals, whatever scant literature I could find whenever the exhaustive toil of my body and the Essence treatments made my mind prioritize slumber. The furthest I see is the edge of this landscape. The entire city of the Afterlife looks like a porcelain chalice filled with white foam and wild berry mead, between the radiant azure roofs and polished marble walls, embellished with eaves of lustrous gold. The streets that wrap between the buildings are lined with raw granite, so perfectly flat as if nature intended it, reminiscent of the snow and ice these citizens only experience from a vast distance. And in the center, so many miles away where all the moisture of the basin congregates, is an island of glistening land where the tallest buildings rival the height of the outer rim.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s quite a walk,&quot; I say, and I&apos;m taken aback when one of my escorts takes offense.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Is that some kind of joke? You think people like us would waste our time on foot?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, not at all,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There. There&apos;s our ride. The Grandmaster sent for a touring car to take us there,&quot; he says. &quot;And that other guest is joining us, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The low hum of an engine crescendoes as a vehicle approaches. I can count on my hands how many times I&apos;ve had the privilege to ride in one of these cars: each time at the conclusion of a school year when Valentina&apos;s chauffeurs ferry us from the Academy to lavish parties at her estate: in the early years to protect us from danger, and in the later years to protect us from ourselves, preventing a dangerous, lonely, moonlit trek with half a handle of liquor. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s so lovely to see you up and about,&quot; Sylvia says. Driven from a barracks far more exorbitant than Merlot blood could ever dream of, she&apos;s taken the time to look her best. She leans against my shoulder as the motor hums to life once more, and I feel an odd and uncomfortably unrequited sense of stillness.</p>
<p>&emsp;It takes me a while to figure what&apos;s missing after the automobile departs from the curbside, and I feel that strange sensation of inertia in all directions like riding the swaying gondola from summit to ground. It&apos;s far unlike the train that starts where the gondola leaves off, traveling in a perfectly straight line. What&apos;s missing is how smooth the ride is &mdash; as if we glide across the ground on white rock softer than chalk, or maybe the springs of this great, pearlescent machine are tuned so precisely that any disturbance is ignored.</p>
<p>&emsp;It only gets warmer the closer we draw to the center, covering miles and miles in such a small span of minutes. They make fun of my captivation at the miracle of motion as if I were some kind of savage, throwing the word &apos;rustblood&apos; like Ullrich, yet I think they&apos;re insane to ever become used to this blessing. And Sylvia joins me in splendor. The silent rush of wind beyond the purr of the motorcar in the spaces when the driver lifts their foot from the accelerator and we descend on gravity alone into the basin; what it sounds like to be far from the eternal clockwork of industry in a land where their worship provides sustenance for all.</p>
<p>&emsp;The verdant grass loses the lifeless brown. Lush, leafy bushes explode with vibrant flowers, unafraid to show their colors when they&apos;re not fighting for the meager nutrients to survive, and my hand grazes the foliage I can reach on the side of the road. The island approaches as the ground runs flat in the bottom of the basin, reflecting a line of light in the peaks brighter than the golden eaves, boundlessly offered by the unsetting sun.</p>
<p>&emsp;For a while, I forget the conditions of my presence here, a tourist of these sights I never imagined beyond Everett&apos;s forbidden books, thinking them a fantasy. It&apos;s just as we slither around a switchback to face the place from whence we came that I notice the strangest sight, rubbing my eyes to try to reconcile the bending light. It&apos;s somewhere east of where we left, just over the rim, but still within the bounds of the Afterlife, distorting the air around it like the affects of a heated grill.</p>
<p>&emsp;I ask them what it is.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ll learn soon enough,&quot; he says. And quickly adds, &quot;when you&apos;ve been here for long enough, of course.</p>
<p>&emsp;The air condenses several degrees when we cross the bridge to the great island embellished with the finest buildings, looking so new though they hold that venerable beauty that only the most masterful craftsmen of history could ever create. I consider they must be the centers of worship where the selfless sacrifice of their time allows the Gods to provide sustenance for all, designed for the pleasure of a celestial eye that looks for reassurance of our eternal exaltation.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that I see the populace walking towards the central spires. What they wear is nothing like the vantablack threads of the Royal Guard: immaculately white in a way that boasts of how pristine and unadulterated their lives are, only colored by the precious jewelry and patterned colors, and for a while I feel that I should bow before them, undeserving of their slightest attention. Not a single one looks a day over middle age, their faces only creased by laugh lines that make it impossible to imagine a moment of sorrow, yet it feels as if each has lived for a hundred peaceful years.</p>
<p>&emsp;We pull up a couple hundred yards away from the central building I can only assume is either a political center, a house of holy worship, or both, with a square perimeter path of red stones spanning at least a quarter mile square. I can&apos;t resist imagining how many of the destitute families below could thrive in such an unused, well-manicured space, but I have to focus on the words I carry from the experience below: one of such pain that these smiling worshippers couldn&apos;t fathom to imagine. The azure spires cast peaks of shadow that stab into the grass, obscuring the sun, yet the central hall has so many windows etched into all sides of the marble that rectangles of magnified orange radiate the dewy fronds. The grass is so soft beneath my feet as we cut across the great yard with all the other finely-dressed acolytes raising the excitement of their peers. My entourage surrounds me closely as if I were either a guest of honor or a prisoner. Sylvia gets her space. And when I enter the main hall, I hear raucous shouts that sound like celebration, wondering if this is truly the event that Ullrich described to me.</p>
<p>&emsp;Unlike the flimsy stands of the Academy&apos;s auditorium where I gave my speech, there are sofas of box seats shaped in &quot;U&quot; formations that face towards the stage in the center, each grouping with an overstocked personal bar. But it&apos;s not just drinks. The succulent smell of the most delicious cuts of meat assault my senses, and I realize I&apos;ve never felt so hungry in my life. There is laughter, clanging golden chalices, and more red wine than all the blood shed by their lower subjects. I hear the voice of Ullrich in the speakers as I descend the stairs, omnipresent like the celestial beings that must have had a hand in sculpting this haven. There are so many people here. The closer I draw to the front, the more claustrophobic the crowding becomes, though the circle of guards part through the masses like a hot knife. They hardly give me any attention: despite how Ullrich dressed me, I only receive looks of disgust and contempt.</p>
<p>&emsp;Ullrich eyes me between words in his speech. They celebrate the survival of Blackwater, still alive after the massive Chymaeran offensive. There are cheers, laughter, and as many drunken-red faces as that of Vermillion Boulevard after exam week.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The next Golden Age approaches in only moments, after so many endless years we&apos;ve waited. The enemy of true-blooded Humans will finally pay their price. We will return!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;And at that, another great cheer echoes through the hall. Gold bracelets clatter. Crystal chalices raise with wine I imagine is older than Nordhaven. We set our chairs briefly in one of the boxes. Sylvia settles at the table, taking a long drink of wine. And when I approach the stage, I take my first full look out at the crowd. Candles adorn every table, and despite their high spirits, I consider this is still a vigil for the unwitting victims below&mdash;whom to these people must be far out of sight and mind. But Ullrich&apos;s speech reassures me that, deep down, we all share the same common enemy.</p>
I approach the stage as Ullrich introduces me. &quot;And for your entertainment, we have a special guest tonight: one of the lone survivors of Blackwater, the Valedictorian of the Northern Province, district fourteen, Titus Berguard!&quot;"},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Vainglory","SevenWordSummary":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Seventeen","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Seventeen","ActNum":1,"ChapterOverride":"","ChapterPart":17,"ChapterFull":17,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Style":"Firebrand","Perspective":"Titus","Index":55,"Label":"No Label","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"54","Synopsis":"Tomorrow marks the advent of a golden age!","NextPublish":"<$custom:NextPublish","VerboseID":"1.17","VerboseOverride":"","Links":{"Wattpad":"https://www.wattpad.com/user/SavantGuarde","Personal":"https://autononymous.io/authors-and-stories/savantguarde/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand/firebrand-1-17","RoyalRoad":"https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/109661/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand-book-one","AO3":"https://archiveofourown.org/works/63835228/chapters/164389633","DeviantArt":"https://www.deviantart.com/savant-guarde"},"DocName":"

<p>&emsp;The words leave my lips by their own volition. My emotions crescendo with the weight of my words. This is nothing like that soulless graduation speech. This time I speak not of future dreams and visions of success and camaraderie: those visions are the afterimage of a beautiful dream our lower people dreamt before the horrors of Endogeny. Wrapped in my words, I don&apos;t notice the expressions of the crowd. I&apos;m trying to stay afloat, on the edge of drowning in all the anxiety and sorrow, closing to this podium like a branch that will save my life.</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m afraid of what might happen to me if I stop talking. My eyes water when I think of their faces. Romin. Valentina. Ellie and my father, cherished family and friends I failed to protect. </p>
<p>&emsp;As longer pauses span between words, I am finally attentive to the crowd. They continue drinking and laughing, not paying any attention to what I have to say. These are stories of the real people that fell to the Chymaera to keep them alive, who haplessly took the brunt force of our common enemy.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The Chymaera will pay for what they did. We all need to live on in their names,&quot; I say, and as I continue to speak on the courage of my comrades, the demeanor of the crowd is changing, as if they&apos;ve heard enough. When I use the words &quot;lower peoples&quot; and &quot;honor&quot; and &quot;sacrifice&quot; in the same string of sentences, their expressions grow sour.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;They are the heroes. Never forget their names, as long as you all live, because&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, shut up, already!&quot; A heckler derails my train of thought. I consider I&apos;m hearing things, as if the thoughts in my head have been given a voice, but then it continues. &quot;They were meant to die.&quot; </p>
<p>&emsp;And then I realize their laughter wasn&apos;t in idle side chatter.</p>
<p>&emsp;They find this funny. My words are just another piece of entertainment for them.</p>
<p>&emsp;All the energy I have in sympathy dissolves wholly to unbridled anger. My tongue sharpens to a dagger on the grindstone of their ignorance.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why? Why do you laugh? We share a common enemy! Did we all die just so you could celebrate?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You died so we could live, you stupid rustblood!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Ullrich chimes in, then, from behind me. &quot;And here he is: one of the last pathetic bastards we found we beyond the walls.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The crowd laughs and jeers. I feel myself crumbling inwards in a visceral mix of terror, disbelief, and spite, because in this finite moment my soul is ungalvanized from the anguish, scratched away by the wear of sudden and immutable suffering, the rot spreads as a thousand years of rust.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Show us now! Show us what you have to say to the true enemy of the Humans.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s the Chymaera! I&apos;m not one of them, I swear,&quot; I say, pleading now. &quot;I&apos;m one of you!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m pelted in the chest by something that stings like rubber, and from the ruddy residue left on my clothes, I realize it&apos;s an entire cooked steak. A meal finer than I could ever provide for Ellie, something well-cooked I&apos;ve only eaten once or twice in my life.</p>
<p>&emsp;But Ullrich halts them. &quot;Not yet, people. You will get your chance,&quot; he says, &quot;as much as you wanted to see Endogeny cull the ones whose weakness led us here. Today we will make an example of the weak: the offspring of the rustbloods who let our people die!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The people jeer and cajole like caged animals, as if a century of ceaseless catering atop the great pedestal of Lionshead was a plight that could ever incite such anger. Ullrich smiles at the response he&apos;s cultivated. I can tell he looks forward to what comes next.</p>
<p>&emsp;The vision persists in my mind of all the people who wait for me on the other side of the Reservoir. Somewhere I&apos;m sure my sister has been reunited with my father. Romin and Valentina await my return. For a month I&apos;ve been forestalled from accepting the inevitability of the end.</p>
<p>&emsp;I won&apos;t go out a coward.</p>
<p>&emsp;I spring to action on feeble limbs, driving everything I have in one punch against Ullrich, and I catch him by surprise. My knuckles crack as they grind against his cheek, and the smile on my face crests to an ear-to-ear grin as I prepare to tell these spineless bastards the truth they refuse to hear, regardless of whether they accept it.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The people below are the real heroes of our people. All you will ever be known to history as are the parasites that leech off of true Humanity, the ones who enabled you!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The Royal Guard approach, armed to the teeth, but they don&apos;t raise their weapons, because they know another force can hurt me far more.</p>
<p>&emsp;I don&apos;t see the crystal chalice before it collides with my head: it blends too well with the reflections of jewelry and glass. My tongue stops dead in my mouth, still as cardstock and dry as paper. The taste of iron and the sensation of warmth are the last sensations I feel before time lapses and my head collides with the stage. They still insist on staying in the audience. Their clothes are far too disgustingly white to tarnish them with the streak of blood that scrapes in front of me. They fear all the matters of man that callous the hands and spread dirt on the palms, thinking themselves too clean to see the result of their murders. And thus the crystal chalice that likely fractured my skull came from no-one, just as the blame of unleashing Endogeny on the population can&apos;t fall on the blind.</p>
<p>&emsp;My adrenaline will last me long enough to speak my last words. I raise myself to my knees and prepare my vocal cords.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You all are murderers. You can incapacitate, curse out, and bludgeon me, but you can never remove the weight of the ultimate truth, and you all will die with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that Ullrich grabs me. &quot;I want you to know it was nothing personal,&quot; he whispers, before driving his knee into my stomach, letting me keel over in the absence of breath. &quot;When I let your father die. Those Chymaerans that you inferior people fear are the ones that stand with us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My limbs refuse to lift me from the stage. I had just enough strength to speak and just enough fury to attack him once. My vision falters when I look to the box seats where Sylvia sits, squinting to see if I can find those crimson eyes before I&apos;m stoned with artifacts finer than anything Clint&apos;s shop could ever sell; before the refined barbarism of these godless adherents ends me. All I know is that she is there. She covers her eyes of the sight though she convulses with sobs, too timid and afraid to watch me dying.</p>
There is nothing left for me here. But Ullrich doesn&apos;t want me to die. Between the cheers of this congregation, he makes his pronouncement: &quot;This rustblood, and the other two prisoners, will be saved for later. Endogeny will finish its liquidation of the last stragglers in merely a day, and these will be the last to fall to the tar. Tomorrow begins the rise of the pure-blooded Mask, the Heiress of Purgatory, whose divinity spans two races. She toils deep within the heart of this mountain to train and raise an army of the worthy. With the new golden age of the Humans only a sunset away, we will rise and reclaim Nordhaven, and all the lands beyond the frost!&quot;"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"SevenWordSummary":"","AutoNameFull":37,"ActNum":1,"ChapterOverride":"","ChapterPart":17,"ChapterFull":17,"VerboseOverride":"","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":37,"Style":"Firebrand","Perspective":"Titus","Index":57,"Label":"No Label","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"56","Synopsis":"[ 01/2024 ]  Arrive at first floor of the Undercroft, kept with Lyra and Raine.

<p>&emsp;So little I remembered of the trip to the dungeon: only two similarities and a difference. First, it was the same escorts surrounding me just as closely as they did before, without the pleasantries of a word. Second, it was the same car that took me there, leading me to an understanding that this was the plan the whole time.</p>
<p>&emsp;The only difference is the feeling of betrayal I could never imagine: to have my understandings of this people transition from lauded selflessness to utter disgust; to have all those formative years in Seminary I learned songs of admiration and worship to mean absolutely nothing; only certain of the presence of divinity by that inexplicable column of crimson light in my dead father&apos;s shop that precipitated all of this.</p>
<p>&emsp;We drew closer and closer to that anomalous mirage of bending light on the horizon, just over the rim, and when we finally made it to the precipice, I saw the endless stretch of warehouses, segregated by rail lines fanning like capillaries from a vein of something critical being distributed around the city. Nearest to the northeast near Province Nine, I could see that one of them leads to a depot where I can only imagine a lift carries those resources down.</p>
<p>&emsp;Darkness consumed the open-topped touring car after we descended between the span of warehouses. It&apos;s a wide tunnel with two rail lines on either side. I felt a nausea crescendo the closer we drew to the light at the end, as if my body was being compressed and stretched against its own matter though it holds the same volume. The guards held their noses, ducked their heads, and closed their eyes as if they felt it a thousand times before. But with my eyes wide open, the shrinking world behind us took on a distinct shade of blue as if  our eyes were adjusting from candlelight, though this long tunnel is darker than sin. There was no fire to precipitate the sensation of heat, or the glowing motes passing us that shift from blood red to yellow to white to cerulean to deep indigo, giving off no ambient light. Ahead, the grand skylit chamber looked as if it were set ablaze, redder than the sky when Everett&apos;s trade house burned with the children inside, minus the ash and smoke. The colors saturated stronger with acceleration, the sensation of all my matter being pulled from the front and back and squeezed on every side, until finally we came to a stop at the threshold of a vast chamber, bathed once more in pure white light from wide openings above.</p>
<p>&emsp;Now they escort me from the automobile, depriving me of all my possessions. Parting with my mother&apos;s necklace means so little now that there is no one else left to remember her. They strip me of the fine-woven uniform, giving me the only sullied linen outfit I&apos;m convinced exists in this puritan bubble &mdash; that is, until I pass the room filled with thousands of the same, lightly tinged with dried blood that couldn&apos;t have been cleansed in the meager seconds each of these were cleaned.</p>
<p>&emsp;The cloth feels older than humanity itself. When my fingertips graze the tears in the fabric, I realize they&apos;re not the frayed, soft contours of holes made from wear, but from something sharp that sliced the threads and the meat behind it. A residue of fine particulate garnishes my fingers, and I find it&apos;s from the fabric itself: so old that the smallest fragments of the fiber lack the strength to adhere together, and if I dressed any more aggressively, the outfit might have turned to dust.</p>
<p>&emsp;I think it is glass that accents the entire outside of this dome, so great it might be able to cover the entire Academy of Province Twelve, but it&apos;s something else. No way that glass could ever be curved so precisely absent the scratches, over such a vast surface, and when I look closer, it looks like a shaded membrane of some gas that doesn&apos;t like being crushed. Maybe that entire experience in the tunnel spans only a couple feet up there: unsurvivable by even the celestials, and when I hear something crash to the ground in front of me, I find the only other sign of life at my feet. It&apos;s a cardinal: flushed with vibrant feathers on its right side as if it died only seconds ago. The midsection is bare, stripped to rotting meat as if the decay of weeks had taken hold of it. And on the left, there is nothing left but the bones that once held the structure of the wings.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Keep moving,&quot; my entourage beckons: the first words they&apos;ve said since they dragged me from the hall. We march through another tunnel lit in patterned rectangles of light from above, and I come to understand that there are three of these monolithic chambers in a triangle joined by the halls. Something divinely powerful and older than the rocks of this planet rumbles below. It sounds like voices, like entire conversations spoken in seconds, the sound of tools of both violence and labor. Though I can&apos;t see past the threshold of the overlook, I know it&apos;s there to afford light to whatever survives beneath, probably spanning deeper than the height of the frostbitten ground at the foothills of this vast mountain.</p>
<p>&emsp;We descend a set of stone stairs, and the light is ever-so-slightly saturated in blues and reds once again. I hold my nose and close my eyes or else I might vomit, led by the guards and my grasp of the guardrail until there&apos;s no more steps etched in the stone. The cells were recently vacated: I can tell from the sight of half-consumed produce and meat without the yellowed decay or smell of rot, and it&apos;s when I hear the shouting that I realize I&apos;m being led to the other two unfortunate prisoners.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;This is all your fault! I told you over and over that the debt we amassed for being out there &mdash; for holding to that pathetic, imaginary sense of self-congratulatory purpose &mdash; would come due. That it would result in this if we didn&apos;t try. The collapse of everything. And all we did was fucking watch!&quot; The young woman says</p>
<p>&emsp;They don&apos;t even notice at first when the steel-barred door hinges open, creaking on centuries of rust, and I&apos;m ushered into the cell. The massive dark-skinned man dressed in aged robes of the Carmine bows his head as he crumples in the corner. The carved stone is dark in splotches beneath his head, and I realize that he must be crying. He wipes his gray beard of the mucus that collected there, still refusing to deposit it on his robes though he&apos;s been stripped of all his honor.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And we call ourselves the First Red? The ones that staked our whole lives on planning a return, on liberating our own flesh and blood that were raised to die? The ones that are already dead? Those vaults in all the compounds are still full: full of all the implements we needed to at least fucking try, Raine!&quot; She shouts. When she withdraws the hood of her own Carmine fabrics, her back turned to me, I recognize this anger is only half of her raw display of emotion. Behind the dark-brown braid that spans from behind her head to the front of her right shoulder, she weeps harder than the man called Raine squatting in the corner.</p>
<p>&emsp;Raine&apos;s voice is deep and remorseful. &quot;I understand, Lyra. I understand your grief, and I&apos;m aware . . . of our failure . . . &quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Trapped in the very chambers their weakest young are sent to toil, to train . . . kids no older than I look that come out beyond recognition, if they ever leave. And can you believe this place was once a blessing? A Divine Wish by a Chosen Mask to afford a boundless source of sustenance with meager sacrifice of every living person? Bastardized for war and imbalance?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I&apos;m hesitant to speak so I just stand there. All that&apos;s left is to bide time before whatever fate approaches, and I&apos;ve resigned myself to it.</p>
<p>&emsp;The girl called Lyra slumps in the other corner. Her hazel, bloodshot eyes briefly meet mine before settling on the floor, letting seconds pass before she offers so much as a word. &quot;And what makes you so important to them?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No idea. I was good at the Academy. That&apos;s about all I ever was.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I ramble on with recent events. My voice is better background noise than the rumble of whatever churns beneath us, and with my aching body devoid of any peace to bring me to sleep, I spill everything to try to find the slightest sliver of catharsis.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And so I lost everything. My father. My sister. My fireteam. And now the person most special to me. She couldn&apos;t even watch when I stood up for myself,&quot; I tell them.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Family was a sacrifice for all of us. We&apos;ll be joining them in the Reservoir soon enough,&quot; Raine says. &quot;I gave up my family to act as a liaison for the Carmine of my Province. I thought it was for the better. To prepare. To return and save our own race, but we became so&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Complacent. Pathetic. Self-gratifying over an unkept promise, tugging yourselves off to your own glory,&quot; Lyra says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know that,&quot; Raine says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Your own family,&quot; I ask, &quot;are they dead?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I have no way to know. All I know is that my children think their mother and I am. It had to be airtight. When the last elder passed and the opportunity arose, I was next in line, and it had to be unquestionable, no paperwork or trail leading back, or else the Afterlife would smite us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Lyra adds, &quot;And all that was&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, Lyra,&quot; Raine says. &quot;It was all for nothing in the end.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Water drips somewhere beyond the cell. The faintest light from the grand central dome reaches the walls by the stairwell, merely a reflection of a reflection of sunlight in the dark hollow, the only evidence of a world beyond this space.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And what of you?&quot; I ask Lyra.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve been running of the fumes of a stupid hope that once filled me with purpose,&quot; she says. &quot;My father betrayed our own people. My mother died early. And my older brother put himself in danger to save me.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He gave his life. There&apos;s no denying it,&quot; Raine says.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I still refuse to believe that,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;His grave was empty. Before I ever left the Afterlife to join the mission of the First Red, I visited that place beyond the walls again and again, but one day it was empty.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But that means nothing,&quot; Raine says, savoring a sense of revenge for the poison of her past words. They both rise to their feet. &quot;A shallow grave? Maybe his limbs were picked apart by hungry, desperate wolves with the claws to dig. Maybe Snowdrifters exhumed his body for any precious accessories they could steal.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s not a chance!&quot; Lyra says. She drives her fist against him with all the intention of a powerful blow, but his chest is no different in hardness than the three stone walls surrounding us. </p>
<p>&emsp;Lyra crumples. It was all the strength she had.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I know he&apos;s out there. Or he was. I just know my father was hiding something, that Everett was hiding something, that it would be impossible for a child of cross-raced, pure-blooded strength of royalty to be allowed to die so fruitlessly. That column of crimson light was proof of it!&quot; she says. &quot;He was going to be the next Mask of the Gods. Now all we have is this impostor . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The curiosity of the name outweighs my helplessness, so I stop her rambling. &quot;Everett?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;My uncle. The pathetic weakling that forced my brother&apos;s hand. The one that locked us out of the only safe place we could separate ourselves from those marauders guising as Snowdrifters.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;My grandfather was once called Everett,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Not a surprise to be named after one of the royal children of Nordhaven,&quot; she says. &quot;My Everett was the original. And my father was his older brother: the one that leads this holocaust. You know him as the Grandmaster.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;What? So Ullrich is your father?&quot; I ask.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He disowned me when I stood up for the very people he once swore to protect,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;When he returned to the scene of bloodshed and my dying brother, something changed inside of him forever. It was almost too quick a change to believe, as if he were weathered by a thousand lifetimes in a few seconds. And, by the Gods how he loathed Everett: that lonely, pathetic coward insisting he was protecting what those intruders came for, more valuable than either of our lives. I&apos;m glad he had no children to carry the weakness of his blood. And I&apos;m glad he spent the rest of his life regretting that choice...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well. My Everett had a son that he ignored, and his offspring did the same to me,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Good for you,&quot; she mutters. A couple seconds of dripping water pass the time before she opens her mouth again. &quot;I&apos;m sorry. I didn&apos;t mean that. It&apos;s just &mdash; none of this really matters anymore. There&apos;s nothing left to fight for: nothing left to save. All that&apos;s left is to watch that other cross-blooded monster take the birthright of my brother. Maybe father made another one since I didn&apos;t have the right blood for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;And why is this &apos;mask&apos; so damn important, worth massacring for?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, what would you do to harness the power of the Gods, if it meant fixing something that was taken from you? There&apos;s no going back for him. Not to the innocent child he buried over his negligence. Not to the daughter he disowned because his grief was stronger than his love. Not to when Nordhaven  fell to the Chymaera a hundred and fifty years ago when he was a young man, when his own people escaped to the north, extinguished of all their Essence, rendered powerless from the loss of generations of Essence accumulation. Maybe he thinks he can get even with fate, maybe he&apos;s convinced himself that he&apos;s earned it,&quot; she rambles.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Is he going to get it?&quot; I ask.</p>
&quot;Not a chance. No outcome is ever going to be enough.&quot;"},{"DocType":"Chapter","GivenName":"Liquidation","SevenWordSummary":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Eighteen","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Eighteen","ActNum":1,"ChapterOverride":"","ChapterPart":18,"ChapterFull":18,"ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","Style":"Firebrand","Perspective":"Titus","Index":58,"Label":"No Label","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"57","Synopsis":"May their souls find rest in the Reservoir.","NextPublish":"<$custom:NextPublish","VerboseID":"1.18","VerboseOverride":"","Links":{"Wattpad":"https://www.wattpad.com/user/SavantGuarde","Personal":"https://autononymous.io/authors-and-stories/savantguarde/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand/firebrand-1-18","RoyalRoad":"https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/109661/the-frostburn-chronicles-firebrand-book-one","AO3":"https://archiveofourown.org/works/63835228/chapters/164389954","DeviantArt":"https://www.deviantart.com/savant-guarde"},"DocName":"

<p>&emsp;We bide the passage of time in our own ways. Raine and Lyra pray to Khiras for the courage to face death, while I spend hours wondering why this sensation feels so familiar. I don&apos;t find out until I stare at the ceiling, looking for familiar cracks by habit, as if I brought myself to this place on my own accord, just like I did so many nights before. The only difference is that there&apos;s no window to open to let the cold air fill the room.</p>
<p>&emsp;All I have to measure time is the seven trips to the latrine afforded by the guards: little more than a pit dug deep into the earth, rancid with the waste of an uncountable number of people before me. The food is enough: rather than divine praise bringing bushels of produce from the sky or however the lower peoples imagined it, it came from the very ground, and this place is unquestionably the everflowing source of it.</p>
<p>&emsp;It feels so much longer than the day that Ullrich proclaimed. I find sleep when it&apos;s forced out of me. That reflection of a reflection of sunlight on the far stairwell wall turns dark only once. There&apos;s little conversation between the three of us, since the only commonality is that we&apos;re trapped together. Occasionally we&apos;ll sleep with our backs to each other, or all sprawled against the bare wall with heads on shoulders: our flesh the only softness that exists in the cell beyond the thin fabrics we wear. But by the time our detention expires, it all feels like it was only a matter of hours.</p>
<p>&emsp;The sound of footsteps builds in the stairwell, along with the sound of voices: going up, not down. Neither of us can catch a glance at any of them: at least a dozen, ushered by a single tall figure with silken blonde hair.  They wear the same threads I wore for the celebration, yet they&apos;re not polished enough in their speech or cadence to be seasoned guards. I almost think I recognize a couple of their voices. Then I just consider it&apos;s a panicked mind longing for connection with anyone I&apos;ve seen before.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It must be time,&quot; I say.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Time for us to go. To pay for the sin of valuing our fellow man over progress,&quot; Raine says. &quot;The only sin I bring to this death is being too late to try to save them.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;And then the freezing gale engulfs the cell. It brings me back to the night I lost my father, when the sister I cherished was ripped from his arms, when my blood was so cold that I couldn&apos;t urge my muscles to move. I shiver in the fear and grief. The others tremble, but not from the cold: itching their skin, panicked at something else that seems more horrifying than any imaginations of death could ever conjure.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Raine, do you feel that?&quot; Lyra says.</p>
<p>&emsp;The hardy Raine&apos;s voice trembles. &quot;The power. Not by generations or by nature, but by something far, far worse . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;My body freezes like it did when I confronted the Chymaerans for the first time. My hands refuse to hinge. Even the thoughtless beat of my heart slows to a painful slosh of clotting blood, and when the obsidian-clad, tall, flaxen-haired woman passes the threshold of the leftmost wall, her amethyst eyes pierce deeper than the blade that killed my father.</p>
<p>&emsp;Spiderwebs of purple spread across our flesh like an allergic reaction to wind. It brings me straight back to Everett in the final years of his life when he lost his mind to the Chymaeran Curse, and part of me thinks it will end this way, before I remember it&apos;s not climactic enough for Ullrich.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You will follow me,&quot; she beckons. &quot;Your body won&apos;t give you a choice.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;She unlocks the door, and we follow her up the stairs. The resistance of any muscle undedicated to putting one foot in front of the other causes a strain like growing pains. And it&apos;s when we make it to the top of the stairs that I see all the others that lived far beneath the ground.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus? Is that you?&quot; A voice says. It comes from a face I can&apos;t reconcile: just a little too old to be a colleague from the academy. Or is it?</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s really him. The Valedictorian.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Of what class?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The last one.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;But I never saw him in the trials.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;He was the top of the class! Of course his fireteam wouldn&apos;t have suffered through that. They were special enough to serve.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Why don&apos;t you give us another rousing speech?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I open my mouth to reply. All I manage is a squeak before the obsidian pain reclaims my wasted energy towards walking to the touring car at the mouth of the tunnel, and I find my head turn forwards and down toward my feet.</p>
<p>&emsp;The last trip passes in pain and resignation, while the other two passed in astonishment and betrayal. I find humor that I can brag I&apos;ve taken more car rides than I can count on my fingers now, but there&apos;s no one left to listen. All the acolytes are gathered once more for the final event before the transition of some prophesied golden age, and it seems we&apos;ve been reduced to just another entertaining sideshow. They&apos;d be throwing quartz and pouring their expensive liquor on us if it weren&apos;t for the fine craftsmanship of this automobile. Across from me, the blonde champion stares into my eyes while I refuse her glare, the only thing left I can resist. And before long, they usher us to the front of a makeshift pit unearthed in the park outside of the grand central hall, surrounded by watchers that ravenously feed off every ounce of our desperation.</p>
<p>&emsp;The hate we witness is unfathomable. The three of us, redressed in tattered rags of worse quality than the furthest outwallers, are cajoled with all the ruthless anger and hatred of the weakness that brought our race to its knees, forcing us to seek refuge north of Nordhaven in Blackwater. We&apos;re free game for the clods of dirt and pebbles when we&apos;re far enough away from the automobile, still forced to walk by that deathly, otherworldly force. Eventually we fall to our knees in front of the pit, our backs turned to the pulsating remnants of Endogeny, its putrid smell of unsettled flesh wholly overridden by the sweet smell of honey mead and venison. It takes all the will we have to prevent gravity and the weakness of the curse from pulling us into the pit.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s finally now that I can see the leaders of this regime, seated directly in front of us. I don&apos;t recognize any of them, though I&apos;m sure none of their cattle would ever be important enough to know.   What do pigs and cows know of their masters beyond the hand and sickle? What use is a name when overwhelming power makes the boldest pronouncement? My heart races with that innate, animalistic sense of adrenaline that begs me to survive at any cost although my mind has resigned itself to this inevitable end.</p>
<p>&emsp;The nameless king beckons for Ullrich to end the campaign he began so long ago. Ullrich and his vassal for the power of the Gods assemble directly before us, and behind, the unrecognizable cadets in obsidian fatigues flank the pit.</p>
<p>&emsp;I hear the king speak for the first time. Like any leader worth their weight in needless gold, he tells a story they&apos;ve heard a hundred times before that gets far more hyperbolic and exciting with every telling. &quot;A hundred and fifty years have passed since the fall of Nordhaven. Our capital city was the shining beacon for the future of Humans. But the coalition of forces led by the Chymaeran separatists nearly extinguished our people. Most of you probably remember running for your lives. You are the ones whose strength allowed them to hold on to the Essence of generations. The weak were mostly extinguished, drained of their Essence by our enemies: few of them following our retreat like moths to flame, clambering north through the snow with their meager Essence, keeping the fortunate warm enough to survive the trek alone, leaving more frosthards than powerless swine.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Their weakness damned us!&quot; One of the adherents shouts.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;So we overtook Blackwater. In a hundred years we expanded it from a fledgling city of a hundred thousand into a new capital that forgot everything of its past. We shaped the filth and brine into a system that would work for us. Instead of the mild climate wasted on all the peasants across the land, we consolidated such power that the jungles of the Verdalans and Ahkvasans could grow atop a barren summit three miles high. And we forced the pigs below to produce the power and smoke that would keep them warm. We filled the troughs through the labor of their own people. Gave them all the conditions to fornicate and produce as many bodies they could to slowly trickle with the generational crescendo of Essence. And now, at the end of our long winter, and at the threshold of our long-awaited return, we herald a new Mask, a new vassal to carry our forces to Blackwater and everywhere beyond!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The king steps down from his portable throne to re-introduce the new ruler of their armies and his leading general. He introduces the cadets behind us as &apos;rustbloods that have proved their ruthlessness enough to die for our causes.&apos; I watch as Lyra and Raine tremble to the left and right of me, light of the curse as their champion waits to extinguish us at the most enjoyable time.</p>
<p>&emsp;I hear my name somewhere between the cheers. I twist my head as left as it can muster: it&apos;s Sylvia, awash with that eternal look of fear and weakness that has followed her since our earliest years together in the orphanage. She is powerless as ever, just a spectator to the death of a man that once protected her, that might have even said that he loved her, but in all my affection for her, I can&apos;t find a shred of anger.</p>
<p>&emsp;I still feel the snag of attachment, like a thread, bonding me to this world, and the more I see it, the more furious I become. It&apos;s the feeling of something more than duty. For the entirety of this life I could accept that the world was just unfair, that I deserved nothing and got whatever came to me, whether good or bad. </p>
<p>&emsp;But instead of the stillness I thought would come with fulfillment of duty, it&apos;s a pain of loneliness and fear.</p>
<p>&emsp;I regret. </p>
<p>&emsp;And those words of emotion terrify me before I can withhold them.</p>
<p>&emsp;This entire life has all been a waste. And then the longing overtakes me. That despite the anger and fear, how badly I wish to be safe in the warmth of her embrace, rather than feeling the heat leave my body and fall into the now vacant pit behind me.</p>
<p>&emsp;How I should have listened. How I should have opened the door to my father. How I should have spent more time with Ellie. Gods! How could I have been so selfish to keep her? How could I ever be good enough for her, to render her life an eternal nightmare because I didn&apos;t have the strength to let go!</p>
<p>&emsp;I muster a smile at Sylvia as Ullrich makes his presence, hoping just this once that actions can speak for the words that, despite everything, I had yet to tell her. And one last time, I can forgive her as she vanishes into the crowd, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>&emsp;Ullrich says, &quot;It took the royalty everything to convince me to join their effort. I was opposed at first. But it was the loss of my own child . . . the loss of my two children, rather, that showed me the true importance of this crusade. They taught me the definition of sacrifice&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Fucking rat bastard,&quot; Lyra manages. &quot;Even killing your child is all about you, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;and as I stand here faced with the face of my daughter, I can tell you that this is a reminder of the strength it takes for us to let go of that past. To forgive the weak for their sins. And to give them a quick and painless death so that the ones that matter can forge on. Besides the weak-blooded daughter, I once had a son that would carry the pride of our blood. But now, I have a true daughter,&quot; he says, placing his hands upon the shoulders of the Mask. &quot;And now, for the first time in a century and a half, we will make our triumphant return!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;I hear Lyra unleash a bloodcurdling scream when the Mask is distracted: just enough strength in her body to do one last thing.</p>
<p>&emsp;She manages little more than a couple steps before the Mask casts spiderwebs of amethyst upon her. Ullrich extends his hand to grab her throat and lifts her in the air.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;You can stop that,&quot; he tells the Mask. &quot;This is something I have to handle on my own.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;No, Lyra!&quot; Raine manages. And so the Mask focuses all Lyra&apos;s suffering on him, causing him to tremble hard enough that he begins to slide down the muddy pit.</p>
<p>&emsp;I can only watch as he suspends Lyra over the pit while she&apos;s at full strength. It takes Raine all the resilience he has to draw the effort into his powerful muscles to propel himself to his feet. With his arms outstretched, he tackles Ullrich into the pit along with his daughter.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m coming, Fletcher.&quot; The name of her brother is the last words that crest Lyra&apos;s lips.</p>
<p>&emsp;The onlookers are mortified. Only the king and queen, and all the rest of the royalty, remain in their seats unaffected by the turn of events. And when I hear the sudden turn of the spectators, as if this were some Academy wrestling match in the fields, Ullrich ascends from Endogeny entirely intact.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The strong will always prevail. The weak will always be left behind,&quot; he says, as he returns to his place in front of me, dropping whatever&apos;s left of their skulls upon the ground. &quot;And it is the Essence in our circuits that divides us.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;He calls to the Mask, handing something to her from within his pocket, and I recognize it as soon as she places it around her neck. </p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;The first cross-blooded Mask of the Gods to come to this world. Raised on the blood and sacrifice of the rustbloods,&quot; Ullrich says, raising the necklace to show a single shimmering fragment. &quot;Between the divine blood of the Chymaera and the Humans, she will be known as the Heiress of Purgatory!&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Despite my vision, I instantly recognize it, glowing red as it approaches her: the piece of Pure Essence in the amulet I found beyond the walls. And on the fumes of a dying mind, I realize what I had been missing the whole time.</p>
<p>&emsp;The Merlot never stole it. The Carmine never kept it. It was the Afterlife that took the pure-Essenced Amulet to use it as a catalyst for this godless metamorphosis.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;It is time to withdraw the great weapon Endogeny. It has served its purpose,&quot; he says, and as the Mask closes her eyes to meditate on the celestial power, I can only watch as it dissolves, assimilated wholly with her circuits.</p>
<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that a radiant heat bathes the outer lands in cleansing light. Particles of crimson Essence lift from millions of dead, disintegrating Humans, floating in the air like paper lanterns at light against the eternal dawn. The liquidous void surrounding their island capital saturates with motes of amber, rising as bubbles from something dissolving far below, higher than the steeples and spires of the central hall. And like an infinite blanket of stars, they glow on the light of a state a lifetime past. </p>
<p>&emsp;I have no tears left to weep at the disregard of their sacrifice. I&apos;ve sweated out every last fluid in my body, and I hold on to the meager moments I have before I press on to the veil of the Reservoir. The motes gravitate towards the undeserving acolytes of this godless regime, and they stretch their hands like joyful children, absorbing whatever stolen sparks they can as their flux consolidates on the Mask, saturating her with unspeakable power. </p>
<p>&emsp;But their triumphant elation ends as soon as the Essence hangs in the air, like a room of dust in bright sunlight. There&apos;s something else that drains the electricity from the air, and when the motes begin to flow away from the Heiress, past my body to a space behind me, they begin to panic. </p>
It&apos;s only when the process reverses that their screams pierce the air, casting them to the ground, actively losing something precious to them for the first time in their effortless lives. Because their long-separated Gods had forsaken them, they tried to create their own. They thought they could create an Afterlife greater than the Gods. And now I finally get my catharsis when the Essence peels from their circuits.

<p>&emsp;The upper plateau is eviscerated by an ever-widening column of light, and in the unholy matrimony between opposing elements of life and death, not even dust survives. The column pours into a flat, widening reservoir bounded by the dense clouds, and when I look up, I watch its reverse waterfall collect in a shadowed lake, and it&apos;s as if I see the reflection of another world.</p>
<p>&emsp;The dead Essence attracts to somewhere in the crowd like ferric dust to a magnet, growing in magnitude until it&apos;s unmistakable, and everyone turns to watch. They have no idea of the unholy retribution that awaits them. Ullrich begins to panic. He never could have predicted this: how the tables have turned. </p>
<p>&emsp;A trail of Essence now feeds my circuits, such an uncomfortable feeling that I fall into the empty pit, my head pointed upwards to try and catch an upside-down glimpse of whatever opponent dares to oppose the will of the Afterlife. All the motes are now condensed to a single stream, inundating one of the observers with unexplainable power. Their eyes resonate with the darkest color of blood as they float above us. Their flesh becomes white-hot fire. And in an instant, the godless bastards of the Afterlife experience powerlessness for the first time in their lives.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;This pocket of humanity will pay an unpardonable price for all it has taken!  It is the will of the Gods.&quot; The voice is omnipresent as if whispered in every ear. I can feel the Essence oversaturate the air, stirring around like a cup of tea with so much sugar it refuses to dissolve. But something else dissolves instead. It&apos;s not just their circuits being stripped of Essence now: the flesh of all the denizens of the Afterlife begins to wither. The trail of Essence that once saturated their circuits like the fat in their arteries draws from them, and they face a fate far worse than the true Humans they sentenced to death by Endogeny.</p>
<p>&emsp;Soon they all lie motionless, atrophied of every last fiber of muscle, rendered as nothing but flesh-covered skeletons cursed with consciousness, forced to lie in their last crumpled state until starvation or thirst might claim them, left motionless by the vengeance of hubris. Even my strength is unparalleled compared to theirs. The corpses lie unblinking but conscious: like plants, a permanent installation of nature no longer privileged with the power of mobility.</p>
<p>&emsp;The only evidence of life I can see stands just beyond the stage, bathed in blinding luminosity. The inverted puddle of pure Essence now glows brighter than the distant sun can muster, and all that remains is the same texture of grief and sorrow that I harbor over the waste of it all.</p>
<p>&emsp;Her voice booms like thunder. The blasphemers who thought they could reach beyond the Gods come down to their knees.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;Let this be a final lesson, unworthy renegades, those who murder brothers and sisters in thoughtless avarice to taste the power of the Gods: all you will ever find is the emptiness of hollow, agonizing death, no longer welcome to the flesh that makes you Human.&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;Although they have all committed an atrocity so horrible, it pains the Goddess to watch as they lie there, motionless, pleading to be vanquished. She begins to weep as her tremendous form crests the clouds, and when I try my muscles, I realize my life has been spared. The ground shakes. I feel the stirring of something far beneath the earth as my body is tossed about the ground like sizzling drips of oil on a hot plate. The bodies of the motionless living rise to that shimmering portal. It is the Reservoir: the true afterlife, to show them in their last moments they could never create something greater than the forces of divinity.</p>
<p>&emsp;My hand reaches for that rapturous, otherworldly portal of shimmering Essence: the true Afterlife. I don&apos;t float like the rest of them, and I plead with tearless eyes. &quot;Let me go. Please, let me go! Let me go home and see them! Please,&quot; I continually plead, but that buoyant force never reaches me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel the ground tremble beneath me as Khiras&apos; footsteps shake the ground. She had found the last Human amongst the wreckage. She has found me.</p>
<p>&emsp;I feel the ground beneath me liquefy as I ascend higher than the mountains, higher than the clouds, a whole chunk of the earth held between her hands, ten-ton boulders sifting through her fingers like sand. All I can see is the Goddess&apos; eyes as she watches me, her head eclipsing the moon in shape and light, and it feels as if her radiance casts the entire landscape into eternal lighttime.</p>
<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m so sorry,&quot; I whimper, &quot;I&apos;m so weak, and powerless, and...&quot;</p>
<p>&emsp;The glow of Khiras&apos; crimson eyes well to the shape of pity. The tears finally pour from my eyes, this has all been too much to hold, and I just cry there, for Sylvia, for Valentina, for Romin, for Vera, for Viktor and Isla, for all the ones whose lives were extinguished in the campaign.</p>
<p>&emsp;The goddess&apos; eyes well with magma. Scalding tears pour from her eyes as she sinks to her knees, and I feel a radiant embrace of heat as if it covers me entirely: the Goddess tenderly holding her last living child.</p>
<p>&emsp;Humanity&apos;s last foothold has been extinguished. The blood of eons has been severed. No longer will there exist a mortal of her image to indulge her with songs of worship.</p>
<p>&emsp;All I can see in my mind&apos;s eye are the faces of all the people I&apos;ve ever loved waiting for me now. I try to recall my mother&apos;s face; the shape and warmth of Ellie&apos;s gentle form when I embraced her; the voice of each of my friends.</p>
<p>&emsp;Her wailing cries shake the ground as she holds the entire island to her chest, and from beneath her, magma launches from deep beneath the crust, consuming the grounds of Blackwater in superheated rock, purging the surface of every last impurity as if to start over and plant me in the soil. But I can tell that even the Goddess has given up.</p>
<p>&emsp;Hot ashen clouds consume the surface; the shape of everything solidified in soot and stone; the last record of the Humans frozen in time for all eternity; my home reduced to a single timeless frame if it couldn&apos;t live on with the power of life. The clouds approach closer, but she doesn&apos;t raise her hands to save me: I can feel the scorching heat begin to sear my nerves until soon I can&apos;t feel anything at all.</p>
<p>&emsp;Before my vision melts away, the last sight in my mind&apos;s eye is the crimson glare of the Goddess staring directly at me, before the scalding ash eviscerates the flesh from my body, and I&apos;m tugged by the wrist in a direction beyond space, leaving the irreversible bedlam of this dead reality behind.</p>
<p>&emsp;In the next frame of consciousness I lie awake and alive. The hazy ash trades for a textured ceiling I&apos;ve seen too many times to count, and the scalding heat trades for freezing night air.</p>
But the crimson eyes are persistent.

I can predict her words before they cross her lips. It feels like weeks since I last heard them.
&quot;I want you to know that I&apos;m always watching you, ever since the orphanage, ever since you saved me from it,&quot; she says. &quot;Ever since you showed me that kindness, you know, because . . .&quot;
I try to reach inside this past self, but it&apos;s like grabbing a stray branch on the banks of a blistering river. Moving my mouth and manipulating my mind are like running in a dream.
This Titus stutters. He grasps his head. I&apos;m not quite there yet, but I plant the words. I can feel myself getting closer.
&quot;Because you love me,&quot; he says, and his response surprises him. They&apos;re not his words yet. The bastard wants to run just like he always does, but as I leech in and take control, I can feel all the faculties of sense and sentiment come back to me. 
She looks for the same three words to cross his lips. He doesn&apos;t know this is truly the last chance for him to exchange anything meaningful, and he&apos;s still too afraid of the concept of slowing down&mdash;I know, because I still can&apos;t do it it either.
I fight for control. And given a brain again instead of a timeless soul, the physical memory of all those horrors return to me. They flood my circuits. I lose all the objectivity of a phantom swept through time.
It all comes back to me. It scalds in the threads on my wrist. And somewhere down the line of this thread, I can hear the frequency of Lyra&apos;s dying words; feel all the hard parts of myself obliterated with the crushing weight of earthen rock; the gasping atrophy of lungs extinguished of air and filled with soot; the dreams of water; that cursed thread dragging me towards an end beyond space. The thread was crimson like the blood of my dying father. And I can still feel it there on my wrist, scalding when I look down.
My body crushes inwards on heaving lungs. Continuity returns from the last exact moment my mind bore witness. My throat aches in flames that no longer burn. Her crimson glare terrifies me as I scramble for the furthest wall, choking on fresh air, eyes wet and wide as it feels my flesh is melting from my body.
I scream when my back jostles against the windowsill and I run out of space. I bash over the table as if it could ever protect me from her divine power. Clouds of dust filter through lamplight ribbons. And as motes from abandoned tabletops violate my nostrils, the sensation of scalding and fits of coughing only grow sharper.
She sits on the bed, staring at me just like I last saw her: panicked and afraid, without explanation for the sudden stir of panic. All she hoped for was the utterance of three small words.
&quot;Let me go, Khiras, please,&quot; I beg to her, heaving for breaths between syllables, knowing she&apos;s just going to give up on everything again, just like she promised. The shell of the Goddess twists her body to put her feet on the floor, still wearing Valentina&apos;s dress from the party.
&quot;What in Khiras&apos; name are you on about?&quot; Sylvia asks, frightened and clueless. I flinch when she approaches me, just like she flinched in the orphanage any time I put my hand on her shoulder.
&quot;J-just a nightmare,&quot; I tell her. I try to control my breaths, but my voice still rattles.
She gets down on her knees. Her silken, disheveled hair absorbs the light as her calm eyes try to relax me, but I still cling to the terror of that last image, the Goddess towering over me as she promised I&apos;d live everything all over again.
My back is flat, my head tipped against the corner of the floor and the wall when she crawls over me, sitting on my waist with her knees bent.
&quot;You had a night terror. It&apos;s okay. I&apos;ve been having them ever since Graduation, just thinking about what awaits us out there,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;Please. Come back to bed and sleep with me. I&apos;ll take care of you.&quot;
Maybe she&apos;s been hiding it the whole time. Or maybe she just doesn&apos;t know.
&quot;What time is it? When . . . is it?&quot; I ask.
&quot;We were downtown. Why? Did you hit your head or something?&quot;
&quot;Worse,&quot; I mutter to myself. She twists her head when she can&apos;t make out the words. I try to lift myself though she obstructs me, sincerely wanting something far more than I can give her.
She idles me. &quot;What are you in such a rush for? What was that about?&quot;
&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter,&quot; I say. 
I try to lift myself again, politely, to goad her off, because I don&apos;t have time to enjoy the smoothness of her skin, or the contours of her body beneath that dress. Fear makes that desire inconceivable.
&quot;Stop and just tell me,&quot; she says, as I squirm from under her. &quot;Just open up to me!&quot;
&quot;I don&apos;t have time for that, Khiras,&quot; I say, and realizing how jarring and harsh those words were, I add: &quot;I&apos;m sorry.&quot;
&quot;Khiras? What do you mean -- is this a joke?&quot;
I throw my Academy cloak on. She still lays there on the floor, half-naked with one strap of the dress bent off her shoulder, as if I&apos;ve discarded her.
&quot;You just don&apos;t want me,&quot; she says.
&quot;Never,&quot; I say. &quot;Please &mdash; there&apos;s something urgent that I have to take care of,&quot; I say. 
I know I&apos;ll be waiting for twenty minutes at the gondola for the next car anyway. But I just can&apos;t muster the time to tell her. 
&quot;Believe me,&quot; I offer, but she just sits there in the darkness, defeated.  I&apos;ve failed her again. Regardless of another chance, it doesn&apos;t matter. Because in every timeline&mdash;no matter how much those illusions of past debt drive her&mdash;she will always deserve so much more than I can give her."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":2,"SevenWordSummary":"Titus forestalls arson.

The fire in my lungs burn as they plead for air, but it&apos;s nothing compared to the ash and soot of Blackwater&apos;s downfall. And if this really is the past &mdash; if even the slightest chance stands to forestall the horrors of that forthcoming future &mdash; then that means a different act of arson will forever brand this timeline.
I checked the clock on my desk before I left. The sickening fear in my stomach far outweighed the discomfort of Sylvia following me out into the hall half-naked. The top of the hour is moments away, and I&apos;ve counted every second since, until the metronome of my heart was outpaced by heaving breaths.
Innocent onlookers watch as I tear gravel beneath my feet. They gather their possessions to return home, unaware that no new chapter will await them unless I act. I bump a low-class cadet trying to sneak an unfinished crate of liquor out the doors, and it spills everywhere, shattering on the ground. His curses dissolve with distance, especially after he sees my Dragon Class cloak.
I can hear the shrill whistle scrape the air in two blows as I turn the corner. Poisonous fatigue embitters my throat, and just as the gondola lurches to motion, the doors sliding shut along guided rails, I barely slip in, my foot caught in the door.
I cry out in panic.
&quot;Gods be damned, son,&quot; the operator says. He forces the doors back open with his ragged hands. &quot;You can&apos;t wait thirty minutes for the next one?&quot;
I scramble to my feet, unable to feel the pain in my ankle as I hobble to the front railing. The cadets and their families laugh: <em>crazy bastard,</em> they mutter. I refuse their eyes as I approach the railing, dripping with sweat that chills my entire body.
I&apos;ll pass out if the anxiety races my heart any faster. Cadets turn to the gym to ease their anticipation over what lies after graduation, and running has scratched that itch for me for a long time, but when it stops, sometimes everything feels so much worse.
<em>I made it,</em> I tell myself. <em>This is as fast as I can possibly get down there. I</em>&apos;<em>ve done everything right. I can</em>&apos;<em>t get there any faster. </em>I convince myself that assurance will be enough. I breathe deeply. The urge to vomit crosses, but I hold it back. My eyes raise, hands trembling on the metal rail, and I take in the panorama of Blackwater as an elixir. 
The distant spark of city lights bring me back. Everything will be okay. In their twinkling, I can still feel the pulse of this city, knowing there is still a soul.
I can taste the return of my last forgotten meal behind my tongue, but I&apos;ll keep it down. I try to focus on that brilliant, naive image my former self held to. I try to convince myself I deserve it, that future, watching Ellie grow, living close to Romin and Sylvia and Valentina, seeing them in passing and every weekend after release from our mission.
A hesitant voice raises from behind me; a ghost from a past life. &quot;Gods, Titus. Academy is over, darling, there&apos;s no need to rush anymore.&quot;
I find myself afraid to turn around and meet her face, as if I&apos;ll see her in the last form I witnessed her. I&apos;ve seen her gray matter splattered everywhere; the hard parts of her crack; the hot blood that circles in her veins still warm and fresh on my face. 
And I might lose my composure if I witness every sense of her at the same time.
I smile, though I refuse to turn around. My voice scares me when it wavers. &quot;It&apos;s just who I am, I guess,&quot; I tell her, with a dry laugh.
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; She asks. She places her hand on my back, and I shiver soaked in sweat.
&quot;Yeah, I&apos;m totally fine. Just exhausted &mdash; didn&apos;t want to miss the last car of the night.&quot;
She approaches me on the right side of the railing, trying to catch a glimpse of my face, but I&apos;m not ready to look at her yet. Her long, pearl fingernails dance on the railing. Her hat shadows the light that fades on  sweeping landscapes beneath, forever masking her true identity.
&quot;Why won&apos;t you look at me, Tie?&quot;
&quot;I&apos;m sweaty and gross, standing next to a celebrity,&quot; I say. &quot;What brings you up here? I thought you were going home.&quot;
&quot;I didn&apos;t,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;I just had to visit. You know . . . you, Romin, and I never used these lofts as much as we could have, but that doesn&apos;t mean we didn&apos;t build memories here.&quot;
I humor her. &quot;Most of my memories on this car are drunk, hungry, or both &mdash; waiting until we got at the bottom so we could all end up at that <em>Last Car</em> diner together.&quot;
She dips her hat. &quot;Oh, certainly. Isla&apos;s apartment block was almost my second home.  I felt like I knew everyone there, and not just because they watched my movies.&quot;
&quot;It&apos;s nice having friends like that,&quot; I say. &quot;But it&apos;s also nice having a home. I guess it&apos;s tough when we both don&apos;t really have a definite place to return to.&quot;
&quot;Huh?&quot; She asks. 
&quot;The cellar,&quot; I say. My sputtering mind doesn&apos;t catch those last words before I realize I&apos;ve slipped up on details I haven&apos;t been privileged to yet.
&quot;What do you mean, pray tell? Gods above, did Romin . . .&quot;
&quot;I just mean . . . that every home feels more and more temporary as we get closer to service beyond the walls,&quot; I offer.
&quot;Oh, sure, but &apos;the cellar?&apos; What did you mean by that?&quot; She asks. We&apos;re almost at the bottom, and I&apos;m already thinking about how I can evade this conversation. All I can do is plead ignorance.
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
&quot;What do you mean, &apos;what do I mean?&apos;&quot; She says.
&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m just trying to say I understand.&quot;
&quot;But how can you possibly understand what I haven&apos;t told you, Titus? Can you read minds? Or did Romin slip up, that bastard?&quot;
I fumble for an explanation. I&apos;ve spoken myself to a corner, and as I stutter my words, I reach for one last thing to tell her. If I&apos;ve blown this cover, maybe I can make it useful.
&quot;I know. The cellar. Your hat. Just promise me, Valentina, please, that you won&apos;t get on that lift. It&apos;s going to kill everyone.&quot;
Now she&apos;s overloaded. And in that confusion, before she can call for me like Sylvia, I hop the railing as we approach the station, when the ground is directly beneath us.
And I&apos;m running again. The burning venom in my throat returns as the air gets colder and my breaths grow shallower, but it proves I&apos;m still alive. Just like Sylvia, she calls after me, pushing passengers aside to try to weasel out of the doors. It&apos;s not long before I escape her sight. 
But I run into another problem.
It&apos;s when I turn the first corner that we collide, and the two cloaked figures standing beside her draw their weapons. It&apos;s the woman I met only hours before &mdash; the last soul sprawled beside me in that distant future, muttering her brother&apos;s name as her last words."}
