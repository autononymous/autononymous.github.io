    "<p>&emsp;&quot;This is a candy store,&quot; I say. &quot;We can&apos;t get distracted by sweets! We&apos;re making our plan of attack.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, this is a shop that sells coffee,&quot; Cody says. &quot;Starbucks. People come here to get work done.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I gesture to a lady eating a round, decorated sweet roll on a stick, as she types on her machine. &quot;Why do your people have to reward themselves for doing work? You just do it,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just wait until your world industrializes,&quot; Cody says. &quot;You&apos;ll have more time than you know what to do with.&quot; He hands me his phone. I find several pictures of beverages on the screen, and when I scroll, I see loads of options.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What is this?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You look like a white girl, but you&apos;re sure-as-hell the opposite. So order on here. Pick one that looks good: what kind of flavor do you like?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Flavor?&quot; I think of what&apos;s at the guardpost: the only control we have over the taste is how far we dilute it with water, and I just drink it straight from the pot.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about Pumpkin Spice? It&apos;s nearly out-of-season.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I want black, please,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Black what?&quot; He scrolls the menu.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just black. None of the other stuff.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like an Americano? With at least a little water in there, or&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I want it straight,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Straight, then,&quot; he repeats. &quot;Hot or cold?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why would you drink it cold?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sometimes it&apos;s better that way,&quot; Cody says. &quot;As long as they don&apos;t rip you off by filling a full cup of ice.&quot; He scrolls between options on his phone, choosing for me. &quot;I&apos;ll give you a little bit of room so you can add something. Suffering seems to be your M.O., but it&apos;s okay to enjoy your life every once in a while, you know?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I try to glare at him, but he&apos;s too busy choosing his own drink. He gestures to an empty table facing the window, and when we sit, I can feel the air drop a few degrees from the light dusting of snow outside the window.</p><p>&emsp;He sits across from me, turning his phone upside-down and placing it on the table. We both watch as civilians pass on the sidewalk, and behind them, the steel shell of Cody&apos;s car struggles to melt off the snow with the leftover heat from the engine.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I thought it would be different,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The way people walk when they&apos;re between two places. Work and home, or home and work, or doing some short-list of chores between the two. It&apos;s the same as my world. They have the same expression. Same gait, same anxiety.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d think they&apos;d be more anxious in <em>your</em> world,&quot; Cody says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So did I,&quot; I say, &quot;with a war going on.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He hunches over to rest his head in his hands. &quot;Sometimes I think that nothing could be going on at all, and people would feel that discomfort all the same. When less happens, you think more. And when more happens, you think less &mdash; but the strain of all that catches up.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But shouldn&apos;t <em>less</em> give you more time to be lazy?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It makes you feel guilty, like you should always be doing something. I finished college, and I still dream of facing exams and tests I haven&apos;t studied for.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s just an adjustment, though, isn&apos;t it? Most Royal Guards that retire have a hard time finding peace after they turn in the crest, but they eventually get there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe for one person, but what about a whole people?&quot; Cody asks. &quot;My world made it to the point that one press of a button could destroy a whole continent, so we don&apos;t press the limits much anymore. And if we are fighting, we&apos;re controlling machines a thousand miles away.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then why is there all this anger?&quot; I ask, gesturing to my phone. &quot;Feels like I&apos;m watching my own world, a hundred years from now. You&apos;re all humans, the SAME race, yet people always seem to be yelling at each other. If you&apos;ve solved war by taking it as far as it can go, then where is the peace?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Peace isn&apos;t profitable,&quot; Cody says. &quot;And it&apos;s not that comfortable either. If life is still hard, and prices are still high, and you don&apos;t have something that everybody can agree is worth fighting, I think people start to turn on each other.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So hardship is the default,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;Someone shouts his name.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;Cody gets up from the table, and moments later, he returns with two drastically-different drinks. One is blacker than Chymaeran tar in a clear glass with cubes of ice floating around. The other is light brown and cloudy, with foam and a sugary drizzle on the top.</p><p>&emsp;He sets the drinks at exactly halfway across the table, refusing to push one further towards me than the other.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So I got the dark one,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Cody says. He watches me hesitate, and a mischievous smile splits across his face. &quot;You got the dark one. And you&apos;re right we can&apos;t get &apos;distracted by sweets:&apos; I guess I just broke the rule, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well,&quot; I say, feeling my cold stoicism slowly thaw with the warmth of my desire. &quot;Well . . . I&apos;m going to try this one,&quot; I say, snatching the sugary one.</p><p>&emsp;He frowns. &quot;But you ordered this one!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you left yourself that &apos;room,&apos; didn&apos;t you?&quot; I ask, taking a loud slurp through the straw, tasting something so sweet and rapturous that it&apos;s hard to contain my bliss.</p><p>&emsp;He grumbles before he takes a sip. &quot;Like fuckin&apos; dirt,&quot; he says. &quot;And you drink this? Are they trying to prepare you to die by taking all the smallest joys from you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m too busy sucking down the flavors. He grumbles again, then pours in two sugar packets, then takes a sip that twists his face again, and then pours in some milk.</p><p>&emsp;Once he&apos;s satisfied, he takes a long sip, punctuated by a few words.</p>&quot;Don&apos;t get distracted now,&quot; he orders. &quot;We still have a plan to . . . uh, plan.&quot;",
