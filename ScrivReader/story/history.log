        "<p>&emsp;I grasp my chest where the dagger protrudes from between my ribs. Blood collects in my mouth as I cough crimson, every spurious fit driving the sharp edge deeper into my flesh as I sprawl against the deep, crumbling walls of the Undercroft, in a cavern so far below the mountains of the Afterlife. But the pain is so slowly fading away, along with the composure to form thoughts.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My memories spill from the crack in my skull when the rock struck my head. I can see my vision feathering away. The names of friends and adversaries blur until they&apos;re primal feelings, and as I struggle to hold on to my thoughts &mdash; at least until the Thread can bring me back &mdash; I can feel the ground tremble beneath my feet at another failure.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Goddess stands in her tremendous form, shouldering the weight of the upper floors of the Undercroft, watching me bleed out without any chance for salvation, and though my senses have gone numb, I cry out with anguish when I can&apos;t remember her name.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The cross-blooded Mask is crumpled on the ground across from me: impaled through her chest by the sharp end of a scythe, and though she brought the torment that destroyed the entire city of . . . of the city, I feel a similar feeling of anguish in watching a piece of me die.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But it&apos;s the old man that reaches for the spade that concerns me the most. It will all be for naught if I don&apos;t kill myself first. And so I find my limbs still willing to obey my commands in the absence of pain. They run on the last spark of energy, and when I lift myself from the wall, limping towards the stubborn old man dragging himself across the floor, I stumble.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;His lips are still able to form words. &quot;You can&apos;t go back there all the way, my son. You will never be able to go back there! Why do you hold so tightly to a defeated world? &quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I grumble incoherent words, trudging further as my vision loses its color. The entire mountain is now shouldered by the strength of the Goddess, but it wavers, casting a hastening staccato of stones in the spaces around us.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Let me return,&quot; he pleads. &quot;I&apos;ll unwrite all of this. As many times as it takes to save you. To save our people. To save our family from what happened in that cabin. To go back further! To bring you into a world free from all this chaos. To actually be your father, and for you and your sister to live in a loving fami&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A falling boulder crushes his ribs, taking the words from his mouth. All that&apos;s left is the faculties of his mind: the two of us in a battle of death since this one ends in a stalemate.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I should be used to dying at this point. Yet I can&apos;t even remember the first time it happened. I can&apos;t even remember the names of the full fireteam I lost to get here; of my adopted family; of my cherished best friends or the woman I never got to tell that I love her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Fate decides for us when we hold that hesitation to die. Even the Goddess refuses to let me die. The shadow of a great stone column shades my surroundings. The Thread on my wrist throbs as it glows with the light of life, and as it begins to drag my consciousness with an inertia that spans time, I can see myself standing there on that stage all those months ago. And as my father tries to&mdash;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;say that if there is anything, dear Firebrands, that you take from this speech, I want you to remember one thing. Your sacrifice is what allows the acolytes of the Afterlife to barter with the Gods,&quot; General Ullrich says. &quot;We have always had just enough to feed everyone. The Gods satiate us with sustenance for our prayers. And from sacrifice, we have just enough to protect the last bastion of our people against the evil of the Chymaerans. But this is always just barely enough. Just enough, because of the courage of these young cadets, to fight for our dreams of another Golden Age!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;An applause circulates the stadium like cracking ice. We are enclaved by the vast unknown of the lifeless, frozen wasteland: our race fording a frozen river we should have fallen into ages ago. Every year we treat graduation as if it were the last, because all we&apos;ve ever hoped for is just a way to stay alive.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The grand auditorium of the Academy is open to the impossibly warm air. The ashen smog is too thin here to obscure our sight and poison our lungs. Many see the sky for the first time in years, migrating up the mountainside to visit their children in this moment of bittersweet celebration.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Twelve thousand students in this graduating class of northern Blackwater. Only two hundred of you will defend the Afterlife as Royal Guards. Five thousand more will defend the lower city. And the rest will fight to defend our frostbitten foothold as soldiers on the front lines, fighting the Chymaera. But I want you to think of the others that never even joined: toiling as power-workers and miners that never see this glorious purpose thorugh. To the fighting Firebrands on the front lines, I want you all to remember: you are the greatest asset our people have.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Ullrich&apos;s eyes fall to the span of seats roughly sixty-percent back, notably dotted with absent chairs. It&apos;s no wonder us cadets are called suicide scholars: either signed on by family that birthed them for the stipend, or by the passionate tales in Seminary motivating them to sign away their life &mdash; as early as they learn how to write the letters of their name.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Several cadets far behind us retch into the bags tucked beneath their seats, masked over by the fanfare of instruments stationed directly behind them. Curious, my fingers fumble beneath my seat to find there is nothing there &mdash; but I&apos;m close enough to touch the stage. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Ullrich continues, as the orchestra finds the perfect balance, between muting out the cries of panic and allowing Ullrich&apos;s words to resound in hallowed glory.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I am infinitely proud of every single one of you. We will always be at war with the Chymaera. But it&apos;s&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;All a lie!&quot; one of the lower Cadets yells. There are several in the aisle creeping towards the stage. But the Royal Guard are quick to put them down and drag them away. Uncertainty is an illness that slowly metastasizes in the soul. All they know is that one returns for every fifteen they send into the meat grinder. They even dig the graves before they leave, to pretend there is something there beneath. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;At least suicide leaves something. If they die, not even a single piece of them will return to attest to their life.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;It&apos;s a fight worth having,&quot; Ullrich says. The orchestra has to improvise to keep the lost time. &quot;We are the last survivors of this frozen world where none of us ever asked to be born. But we are here. And you . . . we, owe it to each other, to defend the sanctity of this chance at life. To give everything. To lose yourselves in the beauty of this divine sacrifice ever since the fall of our people. To pay the debt they left behind. To have a chance to return to that golden age!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The choir crescendos with their chorus. Ullrich raises his hands as the unsetting sun penetrates the clouds of smog. Rays of light reach the Afterlife first before the leftovers illuminate our pallid faces, and the Royal Guards applaud and cheer, followed by the cheers of the crowd, booming like the songs of worship we sing to the Afterlife&apos;s central peaks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And to provide the last words of this benediction is a cadet that needs no introduction,&quot; Ullrich says. I feel Romin&apos;s massive hand grasp my left shoulder with pride, muttering either one of his jokes or words of encouragement. Sylvia grasps my right hand before she nervously withdraws. And Valentina peeks her head over Sylvia&apos;s shoulder, expecting me to smile with some strong sense of pride for what it&apos;s taken me to get here.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Not only did his quartet of Fireteammates place in the top three combat scores of their class, but he obtained a one-hundred-and-five percent score on his exit exams. He scores higher than the East, South, and West Academies. And yet I&apos;m told he still finds enough time to care for his sister, and to work alongside his father. He is the pride of our people, and everything that any Cadet should aspire to.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The left and right sections of underclassmen turn to me. I feel the intensity of all the eyes in the auditorium, but I can&apos;t hear the words of encouragement; feel the strangers patting my back and asking me how I pulled it off. It&apos;s not nervousness that muffles their voices, mutes their touch, or softens their glances of misplaced admiration. I&apos;m not afraid of that unpracticed string of words I&apos;ll share, because I know how exactly how to deceive them into thinking they&apos;re special like Ullrich does.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I reach to shake Ullirch&apos;s hand as he smiles. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The applause is deafening and insincere. Ullrich extends his hand as I climb the stairs, timed so perfectly to the music like all his appearances: like one of Valentina&apos;s famous moving pictures, or composed like one of Sylvia&apos;s commissioned paintings.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ve got such a brilliant future ahead of you, son,&quot; he says, speaking as if I were one of his own, but then the sudden onset of a splitting headache nearly casts me down.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The world goes dark, as if I stand in a cave. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The ground trembles beneath me. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can taste the iron as it condenses on my tongue, vanishing from palate it slides down my throat. I can smell that horrid smell of burning rubber, ozone, and rotten flesh of a million dead liquidated faster than they could react. I remember the feelings I had never felt before: of a true steadfast resilience, of burning resentment, and the fading faces of cherished friends and family I swore I&apos;d never forget. I&apos;m so angry when I can&apos;t remember the names of people I&apos;ve never met, while the voice pleads for me to resign this life and let them take over. A string of three sentences.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Open up.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Let go.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Never alone.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But the presence is too weak.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The command of that phantasmal projectionist fades, and though he pleads in my mind with words that sound like my own, his words fade to irreconcilable fragments of meaningless words, before it disappears altogether.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Ullrich stabilizes me with a familiar touch.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Are you alright?&quot; He asks. &quot;What happened this time?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But my mind is still sharp.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Think I overestimated how much to drink to get me through this speech.&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He laughs, clapping me gently on the back.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I grasp my head as I approach the podium with a brilliant smile. I refuse to cast my eyes to the vacancy unfilled by my adopted father and sister. And it&apos;s when I rest my hands on the podium that I realize I feel nothing; absolutely nothing at all. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I was foolish to think this moment would feel any different than all the others.</p>",
        "The throbbing in the birthmark on my wrist is the last discomfort to subside. All that&apos;s left is the eternal chill of Blackwater, the last frostbitten city of the Humans. And after I pause long enough for effect, waiting a little longer . . . and a little longer . . . I open my mouth to speak the first string of uninspired words, telling them exactly what they want to hear."

        "<p>&emsp;The skyline burns in the light of an everlasting sun. Blistering winds raise the virgin snow into clouds of shimmering flakes, blending the distant foilage of the tundra into the ancient sheets of frost. Dry snowbanks of frigid, grating ice stretch further than my eyes can focus, cracking like dead leaves in the wake of my footfalls. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I am a Snowdrifter, and this is my last adventure: tethering the line of danger and death in pursuit of artifacts from a long-past age. Only the poor dare to venture beyond the walls of the the last city, seeking treasures and wares to sell to others who have the money to collect them. But for this last trip, I&apos;m not alone. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We unwrap the scarves from our faces when the smoke no longer saturates our lungs, trading breath behind fabric for the freshness of the biting cold. Furs cover every surface of our flesh with at least an inch of insulation, trapping snowflakes between strands of fur like flies to honeyed paper. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Somewhere hours behind us, the last city of Blackwater awakens. Streetlamps of lighttime set civilians on their schedule in the absence of a setting sun. Turbines churn power into the veins of the Humans&apos; last city, pumping life and heat into a dying, frostbitten husk: a heat we don&apos;t have his far beyond the walls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But there&apos;s a different way to keep warm, even if it stings.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin takes swigs from the bottle to warm his insides, casting me in the shadow of his stature. His dark skin sweats from internal heat as he carries the weight of all his corded muscle. The warmth of liquor gives us enough breath to speak, despite how the frigid air burns our lungs. And he does enough speaking for the two of us, passing time in chaff by listing as many as he can remember.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot; . . . And then the one girl I snuck off with after the end of Seminary. Then that one broad from down the hall, you know, when we moved into the Lofts: the one that said she worked with livestock. I&apos;m not sure what she did with the animals, but she changed my whole view of what a woman can do.&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My lungs burn on a laugh as he takes a deep swig, using the bottle to punctuate his sentences. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He says, &quot;I think that woman ruined my sense of taste!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, really?&quot; I ask. &quot;Becuase you think you can do any better?&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Half the time I think he&apos;s off on a bit, but this time, it&apos;s too hard to tell. Romin spent the last hour recounting the names of all his sexual partners. The hour before, he recounted his plans for life after service in the Royal Guard, and how he plans to spend all his money. And now that the booze blocks his memory, he uses the next hour to badger me again with the same stupid question.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I invited myself to come because I was afraid you weren&apos;t planning on coming back. Gods above, the years you spent getting to this point . . . and when they want to throw a lavish party in your honor, you turn them down for this?&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He gestures at the barren landscape. Trapped in an open room of white flakes, there&apos;s nothing to see except the silhouettes of trees, the sky above us, and maybe rogue bands of Chymaerans, concealing their slender limbs in the branches. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods above, Titus! You&apos;re the Valedictorian of all the Academies,&quot; Romin says. &quot;You should be using it to get everything you can. It&apos;s the anxiety of what comes next that makes all the sex so much better.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t do it for recognition,&quot; I tell him.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then for what? You&apos;re not weak like the lower ranks. You&apos;ve made it,&quot; he insists. &quot;We made it. Our whole Fireteam did. Did you know that eight percent of graduates this year iced themselves?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. And I saw the empty seats from the stage at graduation.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course, our Fireteam is good enough to defend the city: top one percent. But if you were with those losers, wouldn&apos;t it be better to die beyond the walls? Taking the fight to the Chymaera, rather than falling on your own blade?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re not losers. It&apos;s not their fault: most are coerced into it, even bred for it. Some send their sons and daughters to the Academy with apathy for what comes after. They crank out kids like rabbits for the welfare &mdash; train them high enough to get into an upper class, and you&apos;re relieved of poverty for as long as they can study.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you were adopted,&quot; Romin says. &quot;And your father wastes his own money, not yours.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No, he wastes my money, too,&quot; I say. &quot;He gets most of the check.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp; &quot;But you don&apos;t have the ties of blood like us, so why did you even bother? What made you fight?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;A feeling,&quot; I tell him. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A feeling I&apos;ve had since as long as I can remember.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;A feeling?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What kind of feeling?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I tell him, because I don&apos;t have the words. Somewhere between desperate longing and crippling anxiety. It&apos;s been so long that I can only remember the experiences that shaped it. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;So many years ago in that orphanage with Sylvia, it came from a dream I had. When  I was watching all the other kids get adopted. When I had a bedroom window facing the impassable gates. All I ever wanted was to be good enough for a mom and dad &mdash; knowing if I turned eighteen, they&apos;d pitch me on the side of the road and I&apos;d end up like the homeless outwallers. Maybe it&apos;s been raising my sister after my father gave up. Or maybe it was just a spark based off some childish thought &mdash; like revenge against fate, or some innocent dream of grandeur.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He offers his bottle to usher me further, and after a sip, I try again.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;All I&apos;ve ever thought of in this life is what I still have to do, and the people I have to do it for.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. Because winning just happens &mdash; not from all those nights you turned down our adventures for studying. I know they blend together, but . . . can&apos;t you remember any of it?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course!&quot; There&apos;s too many to count. &quot;The time we explored the pitch-dark drainage tunnels in first year? When you led us from the front, screaming that you saw something? And we ran? How Valentina tore and dirtied up her dress so bad we had to cover her with your coat, or else she&apos;d be parading the halls in her underwear?&quot; I expose the flesh on my left arm. A small staccato of scars spans the space above the birthmark on my wrist. &quot;I sure remember how infected this got.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He laughs. &quot;Oh, and the . . . and the time after that when Sylvia drank for the first time?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I remember how close she got to me when we were in the hallway alone. My heart was pounding. She hunched over so far we were at eye level. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I still have that picture she drew &mdash; I framed it on the wall because she hides it every time I leave it out. You think I could sell it to some rich Merlotan family twenty years from now?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The thought makes him laugh. The cold makes him cough and stumble. &quot;Gods above. The darling artist whose Academy posters are all over Blackwater. How would those filthy-rich Merlotan pigs try to brag about it on the wall over cheese and crackers?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I imagine Valentina&apos;s family &mdash; expensive drink in one hand, the other gesturing to the marble plaque below the framed napkin on the wall. Oh, I can see it . . . that pretentious cursive serif they use, etched black. With two words.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I let the image stew for a while. Romin takes a swig of the moonshine his Carmine brotherhood makes, and I only speak when the bottle is upsidedown in my mouth.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin spits. It almost shoots out his nose before he can regain himself. He drops the lead of his sled and almost disappears into the virgin snow before he finds his breath again, laughing hysterically. &quot;That&apos;s not what I saw at all. But you&apos;re right! Gods above &mdash; I must have had it upside-down.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Isn&apos;t that how all art works?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I guess. Unless it has letters on it?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He chuckles a couple times before finding his composure. I ruffle my jet-black beard. &quot;See, I didn&apos;t forget the stuff that matters.  I just remember . . . how you guys made me feel, you know, despite how distant I was. Like I was always welcome to return when I was ready.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, it&apos;s over now. You never &apos;got&apos; ready. And now we&apos;re out past the walls, telling jokes on the edge of death. You gave up a fully-funded Academy celebration to trudge around outside the walls and act poor. We&apos;ve made it, Titus! Maybe we&apos;ll never be as rich as Valentina, but you don&apos;t need to do this anymore. To trudge through snow for several days? Dragging back ancient knick-knacks and forbidden books? So that rich Merlotans can buy them from your father&apos;s eternal rummage sale, and plant them on their mantle as a talking piece?&quot;</p>",

We signed up for this just like they did. You can&apos;t achieve anything without stepping on someone else, so you might as well do it with force.&quot;</p>",

I sealed off the door two trips ago to keep the heat inside, because no amount of Essence can ever acclimate a house to heat when there&apos;s a broken window or a cracked door.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I think I&apos;ll continue this drunk until we get back,&quot; Romin says. &quot;I saw the rations, did you leave the liquor, too?&quot; He inspects the bottles on the shelf above the roaring fireplace. &quot;I&apos;ve never even heard of this stuff before.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He uncorks the bottle, releasing a long-fermenting odor into the air that makes him gag. He hesitates. A few seconds later, he cautiously draws a sip to his lips, tasting it like he&apos;s one of those refined Vermillions as he swishes the bottle around, aerating the long-aged liquor like a dog lapping water. Satisfied, he shrugs at me, continuing to chug several more gulps of it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;You know, there&apos;s Merlotan royals that would probably pay a hundred Kine just for a shot of that. We&apos;d probably sell it if they ever came down to our shop themselves, instead of sending their servants.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He clutches his chest and grunts. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods above, this must be what that Chymaeran Curse is like. It feels like death, right?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;A lot of things feel like death,&quot; I say. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Together, we look out through the tears in the sheet that insulates the window. The sun dips below the horizon, casting shadows across all the landscape. It never gets high enough to brighten the world without help from electric light, but nor does it ever dip low enough for its influence to disappear completely. Though it hides behind the hills, it leaves an eerie glow in the sky, illuminating the two moons in pale green and ruddy orange.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Soon the world beyond the glass dissolves to colorless shadows, like sleep, as a yawn escapes me. The fireplace keeps our ears from ringing with the gentle cracks and pops from the logs, catalyzed by Romin&apos;s  hundred-Kine pours and a whole lot of powdery, dead Essence. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Essence casts the fire in bright crimson, making the smoke smell of ozone, and when our eyes adjust to the blackness as much as they can, I can tell what Romin searches for.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He stands at the window.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Veins of amethyst in the trees, huh?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s what it says in all the books. Those Chymaeran savages seem to leave everything dead in their wake. &apos;Only a single glow left to show they were ever there.&apos;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Death might be freezing, but I think north of the capital is too cold. Even for them,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen anything.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No wonder the rail lines ship out east. That&apos;s where they say the front lines are, where they&apos;ll send all the classes below us. That&apos;s where they sent my brother. He was among the top of his class, you know, like you, but he volunteered for it. Can you believe that? He said he wanted a &apos;life of adventure.&apos;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I hope you&apos;re not looking for it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, no. I was born with a far more refined taste,&quot; Romin says. &quot;There&apos;s too many things to conquer in this world beyond battles. Women. Work. Strength &mdash; you know, I&apos;m not gonna fit in my coffin when I die,&quot; he says, taking another swig from the bottle that made him gag. He squints his eyes, still trying to make out the amethyst veins. &quot;Say. The Chymaerans,&quot; he asks. &quot;Have you ever seen one of them?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Never,&quot; I say. Romin looks disappointed: all he brought was food, booze and weapons, and I&apos;m pretty sure he hoped to use all three of them. &quot;Just frozen corpses,&quot; I say. &quot;And their veins weren&apos;t purple with the Chymaeran Curse. Their bodies didn&apos;t decay to ash from it, either.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But what did them in?&quot; Romin asks, turning back to the warmth of the fire.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They were greedy with their time, taking too much, and they didn&apos;t head back early,&quot; I say. &quot;First rule is that there&apos;s always another trip.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s hands tremble as he tries to hinge his fingers, reaching closer towards the flames. &quot;What do they look like? Have you seen one? I mean, in a whole decade out here, you had to have seen something, right?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;d think I would. You&apos;ve heard the descriptions of them, though. Their race is tall, obsidian color, absorbing any brightness . . . like the opposite of light, hard-shelled and solid on the outside.&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And they say they take the faces of their victims,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Carmine records say you can&apos;t even recognize the difference. And the longer they take your identity, the better they get at being you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I laugh. &quot;Those are Academy wives&apos; tales. The instructors tell that to scare new cadets.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s written in our history. The Carmine preserve everything the city tries to bury. We preserve all the Humans&apos; past, all that stuff the Merlot and the city try to hide. They&apos;re not a legend. They&apos;re out there, and they&apos;re very real.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And I believe, too. While the Humans control life and heat, the Chymaera control frost and death, and I have secondhand evidence of their latter strength. It was what I witnessed as the second death of my grandfather. His first death was five years ago, when the Chymaeran Curse overtook him: the amethyst in his veins, the deterioration of his mind to the point that my father Clint wouldn&apos;t let me visit him. He wrote and scribbled for years, driven mad by the passion of a single thought. In my hands was the map he left my father and I, etched with the locations of landmarks beyond the walls. And with graduation, I know this is my last chance to reach the spot that Everett marked with a climax of circles.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;After several hours of listening to gale, haunting winds between pops of the smoldering logs, exhaustion outpaces our primal fears. And as the fire fades to ash and soot, we fall asleep beneath the blankets we brought on the sleds. My fingers hinge around the necklace my mother left me. Despite the cold, its black, crystalline surface is even colder.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Sleep finds us quickly. We find ourselves alive and freezing the next morning: at least not cold enough to become frosthards. The last material Romin wants for his statue is ice, and the last place he wants it is forgotten with another several hundred years of history, forever lost beyond the walls. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;After I dress myself in the same clothes hardened with sweat from yesterday&apos;s travels, drink fresh water from melted snow, and consume half of the remaining rations I left in the corner, we release the makeshift locks and crack open the front door to blinding white.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The lack of footprints sets us in an uncomfortable ease, as if amethyst veins in tree bark or the smell of ozone could sift the air when we least expect it. Romin sweats bullets as if he can use them as ammunition, still wearing a belt of two revolvers he fetched from the Carmine armory, making the dagger in my belt feel archaic. You need them. They&apos;ll get to you faster than you can reload, but if your sword and bow are steady... the instructors always said. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s roll,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Peak daylight will be gone before we know it.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The second day is faster when the sleds are lighter. We&apos;re almost there: all we&apos;re doing is stopping by to scavenge whatever Everett&apos;s scratchings left for us. Time passes rapidly when Romin never runs out of things to talk about.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s enough about me,&quot; he says. &quot;What do you want to know about me?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We meander around Everett&apos;s spot for an hour, until we find a single house nestled between the hills, finding log posts that faintly mark the boundary of the small estate.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Surely this is it,&quot; I say. &quot;There isn&apos;t anything else out here.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The door takes a full shoulder before it gives. The hinges screech from beyond a century of snow-borne rust as chips of pine wood tear from the bottom, leaving the door with jagged, gnashing teeth.

        "<p>&emsp;The house&apos;s siding groans as it breathes wind into its lungs, and a single chandelier hangs from the wooden cross-beam like a tonsil. Dormant lanterns circle the chains as crystalline fragments shimmer&mdash;if Valentina was here, it would surely remind her of her lavish estate in the foothills. There are no voices outside the walls like our apartments at the Academy, but even in the silence, Romin and I feel that we are being watched.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It feels as if some agent consumes all the light in the house, opposite of how light bulbs and lanterns throw their colors. Romin drags a match against the strip of the matchbox, but the box is wet, and he tries drying it off with his shirt. </p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Romin drags another. It snaps. &quot;Khiras above,&quot; he curses, before taking out another.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t use the whole box, we only just got here,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Hold it sideways,&quot; expecting a whine or a punch in the shoulder. But he&apos;s too focused, an oversized toddler playing with fire.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;My eyes glance at the map, as if we found the wrong house. The bass in Romin&apos;s voice echoes, but it lacks emotion. &quot;Gods,&quot; he says. We step into the kitchen, where ancient puddles of crimson once caked the floors, kept wet by some form of moisture that condenses in the room, keeping the smell alive. The bones must have been picked apart by animal scavengers: the meat left clean like a rib roast in the dining halls after a hundred starving cadets.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I throw my bag on the counter, scattering journals and notebooks and pages and artifacts&mdash;I brought everything I inherited from my grandfather. Romin passes across the carpet with a lantern. His fingers trace desperate scratches on a locked door, followed by jagged, splintered teeth around the doorknob as if someone had tried to break in, bludgeoned indentations that grew weaker and weaker further down. &quot;Fridging Chymaerans. Must have been trying to break in&mdash;the rest of the family hid in here,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But there&apos;s no trace of Chymaeran Essence along the corpses&apos; scratches. Sylvia once told me that when Human blood and Chymaeran Essence make contact, it glows purple, then leaves a dry chalk residue. It&apos;s what the Chymaeran curse does to the blood. It&apos;s what killed Everett.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So, it wasn&apos;t a Chymaeran attack,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Then was it animals? Or . . . was it Human? </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Why would Humans be out here this far? It doesn&apos;t make sense,&quot; I say. &quot;Four-day trips are unheard of.&quot; I scan Everett&apos;s documents and notebooks, and across all of them is the same insignia, the same set of strokes on the stationery my grandfather spilled his last thoughts on. Same with the map, we had been using this map for years &mdash; all the houses, all the terrain other explorers hadn&apos;t charted, beyond the walls, beyond the eyes&apos; reach of the train tracks, all the creases and folds that had been left to my grandfather&apos;s memories, and all those X&apos;es had been circling around one location, where the desperation of Everett&apos;s brainless scratchings reached a crescendo, as if all his cerebral emotions of some long-passed moment had bled in warning. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This map isn&apos;t for treasure. It never was.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then the realization comes to me. I look at the tattered door. &quot;Gods . . . look at the marks,&quot; I say, and then the size of the clawed scratchings make sense. It wasn&apos;t an animal: they were handprints; tiny, bloody handprints; tiny, bloody, child-sized handprints. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin doesn&apos;t bother trying the handle: he can&apos;t stand the thought as an impressionable mentor for the young Carmine. A hundred years dead or not, his kick bludgeons the door in a shower of splinters, and the rancid odor of death grows stronger. The room was some kind of study. The west-facing window glows in dying light as if the entire room were preserved perfectly in amber. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Silence sweeps over us for several minutes as we meander about the scene, until Romin&apos;s voice severs it. Something has been bothering him. &quot;They weren&apos;t protecting themselves,&quot; he says, &quot;it just doesn&apos;t make sense. It had to have been something else.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;If the windows are intact, they stayed in here. They didn&apos;t try to leave. The coward inside left the children out there! Why did they stay in the room? Against whatever &mdash; or whoever &mdash; was in here, why didn&apos;t they escape out the window?&quot; His fingers feel the window lock: still tight against the panes of glass, and he begins to fervently scan the study. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My stomach turns with the setting sun. Anxiety begins to build. If we don&apos;t leave now, we&apos;re not getting out of here tonight. The sickness of that fills my chest with claustrophobic shadow. &quot;I&apos;m not sleeping here tonight. We don&apos;t have lumber or Essence for a fire, it&apos;s all at the storehouse. We&apos;ll freeze if we&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Just hold up,&quot; Romin says, as darkness crests the horizon somewhere beyond the window. The dusk feels like a cold, viscous fluid seeping into vacant space. It feels like diving to the furthest bottom of a lake, crossing that threshold where the return is questionable, where breath is a treasured commodity. Never have I been this far out, and the paranoia of all my first fears as a Snowdrifter quickly come back to me. The sky is dark. The spaces between the trees become more indiscernible, and as the black-and-white vision in my eyes slowly takes over, anything and everything looks like an amethyst glow. I thought I had outgrown this amateur&apos;s fear, and for a second I almost think I smell ozone in the air.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp; &quot;Let&apos;s go, Romin,&quot; I say, &quot;let&apos;s go, let&apos;s get out of here, it&apos;s way too late, and we&apos;re not staying here tonig&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll be fine, Titus,&quot; Romin says, &quot;we can stay here. Look.&quot; He pulls out a pouch with the Carmine crest on it, withdrawing the string, and a faint crimson glow emanates from the bag. &quot;This was only for emergency&mdash;scarce enough as it already is. The Carmine holds a small reserve the city doesn&apos;t know about.&quot; I peek. Inside is even more dead Essence, ten times as combustible as gunpowder, enough to last us a hundred nights or blow the house and everything in eyeshot to the sky.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Fine,&quot; I say, trying to mask the tremor in my voice. Whatever gets us the best haul is all that matters. All I can think of is my sister Ellie, my duty to protect her and raise her, and it terrifies me to think of a world where she lives without me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;As Romin stokes the fireplace, all I can think of were the last words I exchanged with Ellie, the bitterness of that last moment. There is no nature to hear beyond the walls of the house; all that meets us is tinnitus. It feels as if we float in nonexistence, in a vacuous sheet of null space lined with trees. It&apos;s as if time doesn&apos;t exist here; a place where news and sound of the industry doesn&apos;t travel; where the smell of sickening smoke doesn&apos;t reach; the only proof of continuity of nature in the migration of the two moons and a blanket of stars above us.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;I hoped my warmth would suffice for reason. &quot;I love you, Ellie,&quot; I say. &quot;I love you more than anything. But there&apos;s someone in every family who has to fight for it.&quot; I held the back of her head to my shoulder like our mother once did to me. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But she resisted the warmth of my embrace. Her arms dangled in protest. Not seeing her mother or father probably made her wonder if she was ever born at all. And as an adoptee from the orphanage, I knew exactly how that felt.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;She disappeared into the Seminary doors before I could call out to her, her tiny hands clasped around the lunch I packed for her. I hoped she read the note I left in there, every day reminding her how much I loved her &mdash; even if it did nothing, it was the persistence that was worth it. All I could think of was how much I wished I could leave more. Or something more permanent &mdash; something that would stay with her. How will she remember me?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My mind is restless. I have to keep moving, I have to do something. I can&apos;t sleep on the carpet stained with blood, so I scrounge around. A golden corner protrudes from the bag that Romin strapped around his shoulders, and I pull the item out to satiate my ravenous curiosity.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I wrap myself in two blankets before I crack the spine of the book. The darkness makes it difficult to discern the black font from the vellum. I light a candle, primed with a pinch of Romin&apos;s Essence, and it throws crimson light on the walls of the foyer, illuminating the pages.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Before I could read, I looked upon Everett&apos;s books in his library in awe of their black-ink artistry&mdash;scribed in forbidden ink. The weathered pages made me wonder their age, and Everett told me they recorded the world before the Fall of Nordhaven, before the moment that the Chymaeran extremists liquidated our capital city, killing the original royal family and forcing us to retreat to the city of Blackwater.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This book is so similar. Illustrations of a feline race called the Ahkvas line the pages: drawings of landscapes with plants so tall you can&apos;t see the sky from the ground, and another race of creatures with wings, another like plants, and so many others I can&apos;t distinguish. Fine-gritted rocks stretch over endless landscapes in places so dry they don&apos;t get any water. There are bodies of water filled with salt that stretch so far you can&apos;t see the end of them&mdash;to imagine salt as something so common!</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But it&apos;s towards the end that the illustrations surprise me. The chapter reads AND NOW, THE GREAT CITY OF BLACKWATER. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The illustrations are indiscernible. Luscious landscapes stretch just beyond the city. Vines cascade from the city walls: I recognize them as the center walls, the original bounds of the city before the Fall forced our people to expand. And in the center are the great peaks of The Afterlife: shrouded in clouds, in great mystery to anyone living below them. After all, the only contact to those Acolytes who connect with the Gods are the Merlot, Valentina&apos;s folk; the city&apos;s active government officials who carry out Their commands and distribute Their gifts.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;At first, I think I see the Chymaerans attacking the Humans in the following pages. But I&apos;m wrong. They&apos;re tending fields together. They&apos;re working in cooperation with the Humans. Captions read THE UNION OF LIFE AND DEATH and BLACKWATER: UNION IN DICHOTOMY.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I wish such stories survived to stir the souls of our citizens, not burned en-masse in the great book burnings. The Merlot tell us of the strength in severing ourselves from that past, making ourselves stronger, raising our children to fight and defend the last foothold of the Humans so the Chymaera can&apos;t extinguish our people and our light. They tell us there is no space for fairy tales &mdash; that they distract us from true purpose, from the calling to forge a new golden age for our people.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s snore pulls me back to the present moment. The Essence we lined in all the candles runs low, and I pray the heat will last us the rest of the night. I think of Ellie and Sylvia. I imagine their disheartened faces if I failed to return.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My eyes grow heavy as my fingers reach to close the book. It catches itself on the last page of an inscription addressed in ink. To Ullrich, Evella, young Fletcher and Lyra: the next golden age lies in our blood.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The second day is faster when the sleds are lighter. We&apos;re almost there: all we&apos;re doing is stopping by to scavenge whatever Everett&apos;s scratchings left for us. Time passes rapidly when Romin never runs out of things to talk about.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s enough about me,&quot; he says. &quot;What do you want to know about me?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We meander around Everett&apos;s spot for an hour, until we find a single house nestled between the hills, finding log posts that faintly mark the boundary of the small estate.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Surely this is it,&quot; I say. &quot;There isn&apos;t anything else out here.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Why have a fence if nature is your only neighbor?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We toss the leads of our sleds in the snow, preparing ourselves to enter. After trying the knob, I nod to Romin, built in just the shape to get us inside. He smirks, relishing the rare chance to helpfully break something.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The door takes a full shoulder before it gives. The hinges screech from beyond a century of snow-borne rust as chips of pine wood tear from the bottom, leaving the door with jagged, gnashing teeth. It siphons the outside air as if the house has lungs to breathe, exhaling a putrid smell of age.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The house&apos;s siding groans as it breathes wind into its lungs, and a single chandelier hangs from the wooden cross-beam like a tonsil. Dormant lanterns circle the chains as crystalline fragments shimmer&mdash;if Valentina was here, it would surely remind her of her lavish estate in the foothills. There are no voices outside the walls like our apartments at the Academy, but even in the silence, Romin and I feel that we are being watched.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It feels as if some agent consumes all the light in the house, opposite of how light bulbs and lanterns throw their colors. Romin drags a match against the strip of the matchbox, but the box is wet, and he tries drying it off with his shirt. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Impatient, I fumble around. With the ancient curtains still drawn, light struggles to filter through the fabric. But we&apos;re lucky that the horrors of this scene don&apos;t present themselves on their own.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin sputters one in sparks. He curses, and light catches a glint in the floor&mdash;is it wet? Glass? Our ancestors beyond the walls couldn&apos;t make floors out of anything other than wood. In the second breadth of darkness, my leg catches a wetness.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin drags another. It snaps. &quot;Khiras above,&quot; he curses, before taking out another.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t use the whole box, we only just got here,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Hold it sideways,&quot; expecting a whine or a punch in the shoulder. But he&apos;s too focused, an oversized toddler playing with fire.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The third one lights, casting flickering shadows on the walls as if we&apos;re huddled in a cave, and neither of us are prepared for the sight. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The manifestation of an ancient bloodbath comes into focus, painted across the floors as if the glass of the red paintings had shattered under pressure and spilled their contents. A paralyzing fear seizes me. My mind races. My stomach lurches. And now the putrid smell makes sense, the odor that first hit us when we entered. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My eyes glance at the map, as if we found the wrong house. The bass in Romin&apos;s voice echoes, but it lacks emotion. &quot;Gods,&quot; he says. We step into the kitchen, where ancient puddles of crimson once caked the floors, kept wet by some form of moisture that condenses in the room, keeping the smell alive. The bones must have been picked apart by animal scavengers: the meat left clean like a rib roast in the dining halls after a hundred starving cadets.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I throw my bag on the counter, scattering journals and notebooks and pages and artifacts&mdash;I brought everything I inherited from my grandfather. Romin passes across the carpet with a lantern. His fingers trace desperate scratches on a locked door, followed by jagged, splintered teeth around the doorknob as if someone had tried to break in, bludgeoned indentations that grew weaker and weaker further down. &quot;Fridging Chymaerans. Must have been trying to break in&mdash;the rest of the family hid in here,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But there&apos;s no trace of Chymaeran Essence along the corpses&apos; scratches. Sylvia once told me that when Human blood and Chymaeran Essence make contact, it glows purple, then leaves a dry chalk residue. It&apos;s what the Chymaeran curse does to the blood. It&apos;s what killed Everett.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So, it wasn&apos;t a Chymaeran attack,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Then was it animals? Or . . . was it Human? </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Why would Humans be out here this far? It doesn&apos;t make sense,&quot; I say. &quot;Four-day trips are unheard of.&quot; I scan Everett&apos;s documents and notebooks, and across all of them is the same insignia, the same set of strokes on the stationery my grandfather spilled his last thoughts on. Same with the map, we had been using this map for years &mdash; all the houses, all the terrain other explorers hadn&apos;t charted, beyond the walls, beyond the eyes&apos; reach of the train tracks, all the creases and folds that had been left to my grandfather&apos;s memories, and all those X&apos;es had been circling around one location, where the desperation of Everett&apos;s brainless scratchings reached a crescendo, as if all his cerebral emotions of some long-passed moment had bled in warning. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This map isn&apos;t for treasure. It never was.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then the realization comes to me. I look at the tattered door. &quot;Gods . . . look at the marks,&quot; I say, and then the size of the clawed scratchings make sense. It wasn&apos;t an animal: they were handprints; tiny, bloody handprints; tiny, bloody, child-sized handprints. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin doesn&apos;t bother trying the handle: he can&apos;t stand the thought as an impressionable mentor for the young Carmine. A hundred years dead or not, his kick bludgeons the door in a shower of splinters, and the rancid odor of death grows stronger. The room was some kind of study. The west-facing window glows in dying light as if the entire room were preserved perfectly in amber. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Silence sweeps over us for several minutes as we meander about the scene, until Romin&apos;s voice severs it. Something has been bothering him. &quot;They weren&apos;t protecting themselves,&quot; he says, &quot;it just doesn&apos;t make sense. It had to have been something else.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Un-shattered glass in the study, the windows still intact, all locked in the down position&mdash;you see this door locks from the inside, and it was locked.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;If the windows are intact, they stayed in here. They didn&apos;t try to leave. The coward inside left the children out there! Why did they stay in the room? Against whatever &mdash; or whoever &mdash; was in here, why didn&apos;t they escape out the window?&quot; His fingers feel the window lock: still tight against the panes of glass, and he begins to fervently scan the study. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My stomach turns with the setting sun. Anxiety begins to build. If we don&apos;t leave now, we&apos;re not getting out of here tonight. The sickness of that fills my chest with claustrophobic shadow. &quot;I&apos;m not sleeping here tonight. We don&apos;t have lumber or Essence for a fire, it&apos;s all at the storehouse. We&apos;ll freeze if we&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Just hold up,&quot; Romin says, as darkness crests the horizon somewhere beyond the window. The dusk feels like a cold, viscous fluid seeping into vacant space. It feels like diving to the furthest bottom of a lake, crossing that threshold where the return is questionable, where breath is a treasured commodity. Never have I been this far out, and the paranoia of all my first fears as a Snowdrifter quickly come back to me. The sky is dark. The spaces between the trees become more indiscernible, and as the black-and-white vision in my eyes slowly takes over, anything and everything looks like an amethyst glow. I thought I had outgrown this amateur&apos;s fear, and for a second I almost think I smell ozone in the air.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp; &quot;Let&apos;s go, Romin,&quot; I say, &quot;let&apos;s go, let&apos;s get out of here, it&apos;s way too late, and we&apos;re not staying here tonig&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll be fine, Titus,&quot; Romin says, &quot;we can stay here. Look.&quot; He pulls out a pouch with the Carmine crest on it, withdrawing the string, and a faint crimson glow emanates from the bag. &quot;This was only for emergency&mdash;scarce enough as it already is. The Carmine holds a small reserve the city doesn&apos;t know about.&quot; I peek. Inside is even more dead Essence, ten times as combustible as gunpowder, enough to last us a hundred nights or blow the house and everything in eyeshot to the sky.</p>",

All I could think of was how much I wished I could leave more. Or something more permanent &mdash; something that would stay with her. How will she remember me?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My mind is restless. I have to keep moving, I have to do something. I can&apos;t sleep on the carpet stained with blood, so I scrounge around. A golden corner protrudes from the bag that Romin strapped around his shoulders, and I pull the item out to satiate my ravenous curiosity.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I wrap myself in two blankets before I crack the spine of the book. The darkness makes it difficult to discern the black font from the vellum. I light a candle, primed with a pinch of Romin&apos;s Essence, and it throws crimson light on the walls of the foyer, illuminating the pages.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Before I could read, I looked upon Everett&apos;s books in his library in awe of their black-ink artistry&mdash;scribed in forbidden ink. The weathered pages made me wonder their age, and Everett told me they recorded the world before the Fall of Nordhaven, before the moment that the Chymaeran extremists liquidated our capital city, killing the original royal family and forcing us to retreat to the city of Blackwater.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This book is so similar. Illustrations of a feline race called the Ahkvas line the pages: drawings of landscapes with plants so tall you can&apos;t see the sky from the ground, and another race of creatures with wings, another like plants, and so many others I can&apos;t distinguish. Fine-gritted rocks stretch over endless landscapes in places so dry they don&apos;t get any water. There are bodies of water filled with salt that stretch so far you can&apos;t see the end of them&mdash;to imagine salt as something so common!</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But it&apos;s towards the end that the illustrations surprise me. The chapter reads AND NOW, THE GREAT CITY OF BLACKWATER. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The illustrations are indiscernible. Luscious landscapes stretch just beyond the city. Vines cascade from the city walls: I recognize them as the center walls, the original bounds of the city before the Fall forced our people to expand. And in the center are the great peaks of The Afterlife: shrouded in clouds, in great mystery to anyone living below them. After all, the only contact to those Acolytes who connect with the Gods are the Merlot, Valentina&apos;s folk; the city&apos;s active government officials who carry out Their commands and distribute Their gifts.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;At first, I think I see the Chymaerans attacking the Humans in the following pages. But I&apos;m wrong. They&apos;re tending fields together. They&apos;re working in cooperation with the Humans. Captions read THE UNION OF LIFE AND DEATH and BLACKWATER: UNION IN DICHOTOMY.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I wish such stories survived to stir the souls of our citizens, not burned en-masse in the great book burnings. The Merlot tell us of the strength in severing ourselves from that past, making ourselves stronger, raising our children to fight and defend the last foothold of the Humans so the Chymaera can&apos;t extinguish our people and our light. They tell us there is no space for fairy tales &mdash; that they distract us from true purpose, from the calling to forge a new golden age for our people.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin&apos;s snore pulls me back to the present moment. The Essence we lined in all the candles runs low, and I pray the heat will last us the rest of the night. I think of Ellie and Sylvia. I imagine their disheartened faces if I failed to return.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My eyes grow heavy as my fingers reach to close the book. It catches itself on the last page of an inscription addressed in ink. To Ullrich, Evella, young Fletcher and Lyra: the next golden age lies in our blood.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I should have known that map wasn&apos;t for treasure,&quot; I say, my skin pallid from a sleepless night without warmth. I breathe between my palms. &quot;Did you read the inscription on the book you found?&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because that book you found was inside this house,&quot; I say. &quot;And it was addressed by my grandfather himself.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So?&quot; He asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp; &quot;So this was his house! Or he knew the people here, a long, long time ago. I&apos;ve been looking all morning for more clues. I tore through bookshelf after bookshelf, looking for notes, photographs, anything . . . but it&apos;s almost as if this whole house was already cased. It just feels like things are conveniently missing.&quot;</p>",

That&apos;s why my suspicion&mdash;&quot; he says, tracing the corner of the wall again until he returns to the office, feeling for frayed carpet fibers and shifting his weight to feel the wooden planks beneath the surface.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s absurd why anybody would hide something valuable in a house like this,&quot; I say. &quot;This far from the walls? Wouldn&apos;t it be better guarded in a castle or a grand estate?&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp; &quot;Not sure yet.&quot; Romin&apos;s fingers fondle for an edge until he lifts it from the hollowed crevice. It looks like a munitions box, but a lot heavier: the walls so thick it surely wasn&apos;t stamped out of sheets of steel. </p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Valentina calls my line of work criminal. But I&apos;m glad at least someone can appreciate it,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope it pays back for the night here.&quot; Without the Essence in his bag, there&apos;s no chance we could have made it.</p>",

Forbidden literature&apos;s much harder to sell than it was a year ago, and after so many close calls with undercover customers from the Ministry Of Truth, we stopped selling them altogether.</p>",

A sudden flash blinds our eyes: the brightest red leaving a neon in our retinas, and I hear the half-log benches collapse against the ground as we both fall backwards. An aisle of goods crashes to the floor when Clint bashes his head against it. A bright beam of crimson floods from the necklace like a pillar of fire, crashing against the pointed ceiling like a reverse waterfall, filling its volume in an inverted lake of Essenced plasma, and I can hardly see its glowing miasma since both of my eyes are blinded.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I won&apos;t be living here for long,&quot; Clint says. &quot;Your grandfather left us that warehouse of his. We sell that place, we&apos;ll be able to keep this shop open forever.&quot; But he says that every time. It was just a &apos;month or so&apos; a year ago. And it was just a &apos;year or so&apos; two years ago. There&apos;s an emptiness in his eyes when he looks at the picture of Moira on the wall. And how else can I tell his &quot;habits&quot; from earlier? Because I always find a sheet covering the portrait when he&apos;s in the back-room with a &apos;client&apos; that&apos;s looking to &apos;sample the high-value merchandise,&apos; as if her eyes silently judge him from behind the frame.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I try for a certain sincerity, but my voice wavers. &quot;Dad, we can&apos;t keep doing this. Please. We have to move on,&quot; I say. </p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Opened this shop with you, I know,&quot; then I add, &quot;Dad. But she wants us to succeed and move on. To do whatever it takes for her children and husband to thrive.&quot;</p>",

You know I was gonna pass this down to you, and you&apos;d run this business hard, and hustle, after your service with the Academy and you survive, and we&apos;ll run this shop together, you and me, and Ellie can help us.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just trying to do my best,&quot; I say. My glance dips towards my feet, toes tracing the hardwood floors I crawled on as a child. I find it hard to meet his eyes, and I can tell he has a hard time meeting mine, too. The shop groans from years of eternal winter: the only sound that fills the distance between us. That, and my heart racing at the realization of what the Essenced burst might mean. I can only imagine the punishment that awaits us if Merlot sympathizers, or the city guard, had seen it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Clint says, &quot;So why don&apos;t you go check on Elizabeth at our . . . er, the house, and&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But the Essence! Someone had to have seen that. The city guards, do you know what they&apos;ll do to us? You know what happens to the heretics&mdash;those people who use Essence for anything else.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;And our conversation ends like that. No question of how I am, of the adventure I went on, if I survived, if the mortal coil is still in my body. I&apos;m a convenient tool to him as his son. And the only thing that connects me to him is that he legally receives the stipend from my work in the Academy. If he drops this pathetic shop, we&apos;ll have a chance at something &mdash; anything &mdash; else, but he&apos;s too stubborn and resilient to see a sunken cost when it&apos;s in front of him.</p>",

There is hardly night or day in Blackwater. Most of the time it&apos;s dark, though the sun never sets. It just hangs in the sky, sometimes dipping for moments below the mountains. All we have is Lighttime and Darktime, driven by the man-made cycle of electric light on a schedule. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The lower city is sleepless as it always is, the generator workers encrusted with soot and sweat as they emerge from the power plants, trading shifts with others whose schedules never afford them the Lighttime: to me, it&apos;s been motivation to do better in the Academy, a reminder of what happens if I don&apos;t maintain my echelon among the top ranks. Too many cadets fail to return from battle as it is already &mdash; while the top classes are promised the highest ranks in the service, the lowest cadets are first fodder for the front lines.

        "<p>&emsp;There are privileges to the highest ranks of the Academy. They are the benefits I earn, but I never have the time to enjoy or take advantage of. Cadets in the academy are coined &quot;Firebrands,&quot; after the stray embers that spread wildfires far beyond their place of origin. Brought together, these Firebrands form Fireteams, clusters of four cadets raised together since early childhood, forming formidable friendships and bonds that carry into their service beyond the walls. Together, Romin, Valentina, Sylvia and I constitute Fireteam 473, one of the few groups skilled enough to rank among the top one percent. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But I&apos;m not the only member to abandon their privilege &mdash;&mdash; in fact, Sylvia is the only one to continually take residence in the towers (and although my abandonment errs on the side of service, Valentina and Romin haven&apos;t so much as lived there.) </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Whether by hedonism or loyalty, Valentina and Romin enjoy lavish lifestyles at the forefront of their factions, connected by blood to the highest powers of the Merlot and the Carmine. Romin is consumed in his promise to become the Son of the Carmine. Valentina . . . I don&apos;t really have any idea what she does up in her Vermillion Tower unless her family&apos;s extravagant parties bring us up there. But considering that coveted geothermal warmth of the sprawling central peaks &mdash; shrouded in mystery by smog and clouds that shadow anything of their wealth &mdash; I doubt they&apos;ll be burning any money staying warm while the whole rest of the city lives on ice. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Trains take cadets to-and-from the city in large droves, packed tight with little space to spare, the only available type of transit through the inner walls. My commitments always leave me at the tail-end of any rush hour when the trolley cars are near empty, when only the residents of the Academy and their guests are able to ride, and they&apos;re often heavily intoxicated, headed back after a long darktime of drinking, steeling themselves to fight a horrendous hangover.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Before the Snowdrifter run, our fireteam went into the city to celebrate the start of the break, and with half-price drinks on the Academy stipend, I was trying to forget a lot when I went in there.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I trace through my memories of that darktime. Valentina concealed herself with a woven pink sunhat in the absence of sun. She gets catty and loud after the first few rounds, but it&apos;s easy to tolerate when she ends up buying the drinks. While she was occupied chatting-up her fans, Romin&apos;s solemn stare scared them off, allowing them no more than a question of her name before they duck for another crowd.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Sylvia&apos;s always light on clothes. She wore one of Valentina&apos;s (many) old dresses, untailored to her measurements, crushing her in a space that Valentina could barely fill. It made me laugh, how misplaced the vibrant colors of Val&apos;s wardrobe were on Sylvia&apos;s body: most days Sylvia struggled to get ready, showing up to lectures with her hair still damp. In my presence, she always seemed to reject the advances from any suitors that offered her a hand. The crimson mark and hood were enough to get Romin and I a fair amount of attention, though at least I never pursued it. All I could remember were several faces of nameless women, Romin whispering &apos;too ugly&apos; or &apos;too fat&apos; or &apos;you can do better than that&apos; until he stopped judging for me and got wrapped up with someone else. I chatted with a girl whose name I forgot. And after Romin quickly disappeared, Sylvia left upset, and Valentina absconded off with another high-ranking firebrand. Academy dating is shallow, the way cadets pursue one-night stands and drunken nights to quell their crippling anxieties of the unknown world that awaits them. At least for the middle and lower classes, the overdose deaths, grievous injuries, and suicides got so severe that each graduating class was forcibly placed on dry probation at least two weeks before the ceremony that sent them beyond the walls. Whoever that girl was, she just wanted a taste of the world a little higher towards the clouds, and I wanted no part of that emptiness.</p>",

Several cadets stand inside, faces I hardly recognize, and the distaste of conversation carries me around the corner to the back entrance, up the poorly-lit stairwell, and into my room, where I can be alone.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m drawn to darkness like moths to flame. It&apos;s not a feeling of comfort, really&mdash;when I lay in bed and stare at the same ceiling, so familiar with the contours of every crack that I can close my eyes and still see them, it&apos;s a feeling of cessation, but not a feeling of comfort. I find no reason to move once I lay there. Sometimes I hold my breath until I find a convincing reason to release, thinking one day I might suffocate, but that primal fear always drives the wind back into my lungs. </p>",

I fear the future for the atrophy of close bonds with my friends, few in number but so strong in connection, and I know that no matter what I simply can&apos;t let go.

        "<p>&emsp;I lay on the hardwood floor. Perverse thoughts in my mind tell me I don&apos;t deserve the comfort of the bed, so I lay there, listening to the reverberations of a party below.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I let time pass by for what feels like hours, until I think my guilt can lift me from the floor, but it never arrives. I think about the radiant glow of the necklace enveloping my father&apos;s shop&mdash;it wasn&apos;t the first time that an Outwaller artifact had gone off on us. In fact, it is my only proof that a God might exist, and the absurdity of those moments often blend into the dullness of my daily life &mdash; saturated in propaganda posters, in crimson-font books administered by the Ministry of Courage, and in the repetition of combat training where we&apos;re pitted against other fireteams.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The hardwood floor doesn&apos;t bother me. I&apos;m used to sleeping on rough surfaces after years of survival training in the Academy, drilling as my team&apos;s Tactician or unofficial leader, and so I feel myself melt into the hardness of the floor.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The same dream comes to me. For a moment I stand in the infinite space of a dark landscape, the smell of ozone overpowering. Is it beyond the walls? A great cavern? Or somewhere beyond space itself? Thousands of graves lie before me on an endless plane of ash. Most of the bodies wear Academy marks, others wear ordinary clothes, and almost all of them seem to be the same age. I pray they aren&apos;t dreams of a horrible future. I hope they&apos;re not the lives of my fellow cadets in our service beyond the walls. I spend so many nights in this lifeless internal space &mdash; I&apos;m unable to move, without a body, just a spectator to the grounds of a boundless crypt, but I can feel the coldness of my surroundings. I can imagine the abrasiveness of the ash, hear the crackle of distant fires, cascading embers from indiscernible skies and amethyst glows in the veins of rotten flesh. No words are spoken here, there is no one left to speak them. I am just a ghost of a forgotten time, bearing witness to either a horrendous future or a miserable nightmare.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s almost time.&quot; The voice speaks from a directionless origin. Its vibrations resonate within me. Am I speaking it to someone else? Or is it a voice of an internal force? Or&mdash;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Years you&apos;ve lived since that time. Maybe you&apos;ve forgotten, or tried to forget. But your connection has been snagged on that incident, that choice.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I try my vocal chords, but nothing resonates; all I can do is listen. A whole life I&apos;ve lived with only the memory of the orphanage, of the brutal fights and violence to prove my worth as a tool galvanized by teeth and blood.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;A column of light marks the start of your true journey. Only if you accept the natural path, will you ever be free.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Darkness swallows the forms in the furthest distance. The bubble of this dream is collapsing. I can hear my voice being called from somewhere far beyond. The ground shakes. Ash shudders and lifts into the air like a great sandstorm on the gale of otherworldly winds, and everything begins to crumble to dust, returning to the most basic form of all matter.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Die to yourself or you will live forever, son.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A sound at the corner of the stairwell awakes me. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus! Titus.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Heavy footfalls cascade against the carpet. Light seeps through the edges of the blackout curtains. Gods, It&apos;s almost afternoon. How long was I asleep?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The footsteps are heavy, but not that heavy. Boots. Was it Sylvia? Or Valentina? No way she&apos;d come down here.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A fist pounds on the door. &quot;Titus, Titus, open up,&quot; a voice slurs. The voice sounds drunk, male. But it isn&apos;t Romin.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Who&apos;s asking?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Dammit. Open the door, son.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint? What are you doing here?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Just open up,&quot; he demanded. But why&mdash; he stays in the store as if he&apos;s chained to it. I hear his heavy breathing&mdash;either he took a flight of stairs too fast or is on the verge of throwing up.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I lift myself from the floor. My knees crack. The door opens, cracked. But I&apos;m wrong: he isn&apos;t drunk. Fear flushes his face, an emotion I haven&apos;t seen in him since I can remember.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Sons&apos;a bitches broke in, Titus,&quot; he says, &quot;I couldn&apos;t stop them, they took that damn thing you brought in. Told them we were closed, told them to come in the lighttime, first it was the Carmine, then bastards wearin&apos; all black, and...&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Slow down,&quot; I say. His face swells with bruises. Dried blood runs in two parallel lines from his nose, and he can hardly speak, and I want to tell him that I told him so. &quot;When did this happen?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I was sleepin&apos; in the back room. Heard a knock on the door, told them the store was closed,&quot; he says. &quot;First it was the Carmine. Said they&apos;d be willing to pay handsomely for that thing you brought in earlier, knew we had it, they saw the light. Told us that the next party to show up would kill for it. I told them to wait &apos;till lighttime when we were open, but &apos;no,&apos; they said, &apos;they&apos;ll kill you for it if we don&apos;t take it now,&apos; they says. &apos;Then let them come,&apos; I say.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Carmine came for it first,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He nods. &quot;Gods, I should have just let the Carmine take it, I didn&apos;t think they were serious. The next group came an hour ago. Dressed in all black. Said they were from the City Guard, but they didn&apos;t look like guards. Said they was trying to keep all the humans alive. On my, last refusal then they kicked down the door, a whole lot of &apos;em, and they took the necklace right from my hands.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I asked, &quot;So what does that have to do with me?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You mean, your injured father? Broken doors that&apos;ll cost a week&apos;s earnings for a locksmith?&quot; Clint says. The only thing that holds him to this life is threatened. The existential horror registers in his expression. &quot;My shop . . . er, our shop.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I feel the apathy swell within me, and the approach of my uncertain future grate on me. My focus is far beyond this.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s your shop.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean? It&apos;s ours,&quot; he says. It almost seems like my father is on the verge of tears, and it frightens me, but I still feel that force of resentment and anger that tears me from him.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Ours only when you want it to be. I have so much more to deal with right now.&quot; The anger pushes the next words. &quot;More important things.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Well . . . you, I . . . I just wanted . . .&quot; he stammers, but it eludes him.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then I guess you should &apos;quit being a pussy and handle it,&apos;&quot; I tell him, before slamming the door. His somber footsteps drag him away. I hear a sniffle.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You know, you leaving and all . . . I know I&apos;m not good with feelings, but it&apos;s just as hard for me.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;So hard he can&apos;t show up to my graduation, to see my speech, on the most important day of my life. I could tell he was day-drinking during that time. I could smell it on his breath. I don&apos;t respond, and he walks further. A sickness in my stomach rises as the distance grows between us. Is it guilt I feel? Do I feel bad? Or does his absence feel healing?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;His voice is so different from normal that it haunts me. &quot;Promise we&apos;ll talk. There&apos;s so much I want to say to you. I&apos;m terrible with feelings, and you are, too.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I sit on the floor, back against the door, but my vocal chords refuse.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve always . . .&quot; he says, but can&apos;t finish the thought before discomfort overtakes him, and a deep, saturating pain stings inside my heart. I sit on the verge of tears, but my eyes remain dry, building pressure there instead. </p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The rest of the day passes slowly. Three days remain before we&apos;re called to action. The phone on my desk rattles on occasion with calls from the operator, so I unplug it. Knocks sound on the door, but I can&apos;t lift myself.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I eat snacks stashed beneath my bed. I throw the wrappers on the floor. The maid service has ended; no one will be around anymore to pick them up. I wonder how many cadets have passed through this space, how differently each Firebrand might have furnished it. Over there is a window with a beautiful view. Four scuff marks speak that it was once a place where a couch peered out. A smaller spread near the opposite wall shows where a film projector might have rested, brought by some rich cadet, and I recall that on my first night here, I found reels of a movie called &quot;Fear The Chymaera&quot; left behind, one that Valentina acted in as a child. Did this place once hold celebrations? How many people have passed through the front door? And how many of them are alive today, living somewhere in the city?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s the transience of such a space that is so hard to believe, how many proud families unpacked their children&apos;s furniture and closets into this room. Beyond the walls of this temporary home, loud bustling and burdened voices echo through the halls. The Firebrands unpack their things, leaving these spaces vacant for the next proud cadets to live. This space is naught but a temporary place of residence; a base camp, if you will; a place of operations; a bed to sleep and a desk to work; not holding permanence of any kind.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But I have so little to pack.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Nowhere has ever felt permanent. The bills for my childhood home pile up on my desk, and I&apos;ve finally crossed the threshold where all my savings can no longer hold. The demands from the child welfare service are addressed to me now, threatening to take Ellie from me, and for months I&apos;ve ripped them up. I refuse to believe that they will take her: lies of families all over the capital, in other districts, that avidly pursue her. But where else could she be comfortable beside in my arms?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I&apos;ll be away on service for a while. But I can make it work. I&apos;ll make more money. I can pay for the tutors. Hell, maybe Clint will take over. I can pay for the housekeepers, all the people that will keep the house the same way I remembered it. I can love her from a distance. I know I can, and just that idea gives me the strength to move on.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Another darktime approaches. And at one point, I hear commotion from the balcony next door. Upset voices&mdash;too late to be anything related to moving, since the dragging ended hours ago, and the service elevator hasn&apos;t chimed since I last awoke from my third nap.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, you can&apos;t just barge in here. Who are you?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Just a second,&quot; the voice says. &quot;Did you know your neighbor&apos;s deaf? He can&apos;t hear me unless I barge in.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Get out!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The sliding door on the adjacent balcony rattles open, slamming as it reaches the end of its track. I hear a sound of heavy effort. Some massive creature moves beyond the window glass of my balcony door.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, you&apos;re going to kill yourself,&quot; my neighbors say, but the figure continues grunting. &quot;You&apos;re going to break the railing! You&apos;re paying for&mdash;Help! Anyone, get in here!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I hear metal screech. The creature shrieks in panic, and I jump from my bed, sprinting to the door. That can&apos;t actually be him. No way. I have to look like I was doing something, like I wasn&apos;t just laying in bed for two days, and so I flick the lights on, running my fingers through my hair a little, and I lift a book.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A thud resounds outside somewhere. It feels as if the cantilever balcony is going to snap from the sudden load. The neighbors curse, the drunk creature laughs, and the neighbors curse even harder. The door flies open, nearly shattering the frame at the stop, and he enters.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You bastard.&quot; He heaves between breaths. &quot;You know what I had to do to get in here? Good thing those jerks next door aren&apos;t your neighbors anymore,&quot; he says, with the door still open and the neighbors on the balcony.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He stumbles to the telephone resting on the only table in the room, palming the whole thing with a single hand, finding no tension pulling it downward from the power cord. The power cord is disconnected, and he knows I unplugged it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Really? Really, Titus?&quot; he says. &quot;And what could you possibly be reading? Classes are over. Thermal Properties of Essence? I don&apos;t even know what that is, and there&apos;s no extra credit anymore.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He swats the book out of my hands. It slams against the wall between me and my newly-disgruntled neighbors, leaving a dent in the wall that I&apos;ll probably be paying premium for.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You should be getting drunk with us. Making memories. Val and Sylvia got so upset they made me do this. No&mdash;YOU made me do this, and I&apos;m upset now, too.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Romin, it&apos;s just been&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Tough? Hard?&quot; he says. &quot;And you know how we deal with those feelings? We get trashed. We get trashed, and we deal with them together. We&apos;re running out of time, Titus.&quot; Romin turns me to the door. There&apos;s no refusing the grasp of someone twice your size. &quot;Open the door and say you&apos;re excited to see them,&quot; he demands.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Can I put on a shirt first?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You did this to yourself,&quot; he says, blocking my access to the rest of the room. I sigh and slowly creak it open. Valentina and Sylvia are on the other side, along with most of the hallway, peering out at the ruckus from their rooms. Their eyes trace from my face to my pajama pants, than back to my face again, a slight look of surprise and disgust mixed together.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I repeat Romin&apos;s words, mechanically. &quot;I am excited, to see you,&quot; I tell them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Can we come in? Gods. After you . . . get ready?&quot; Valentina asks, turning away from the doorway, her face blushed bright red as Sylvia turns the other way.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Ready for what?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;For our night out,&quot; Valentina says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Now get ready. Take off your pants.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;In front of you? Now? Wait&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Or I&apos;ll take them off for you. I&apos;ve seen your naked ass more times than Sylvia, I&apos;m sure of it,&quot; he says, and Sylvia mutters something indiscernible from behind the door, probably flushed with color.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We don&apos;t do that,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We don&apos;t do that my ass,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Or your ass. Off. And put on some damn pants. Something nice. We&apos;re going back to the Merlot district, and Valentina&apos;s gonna get us in everywhere.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I slip on some jeans that sprawled on the floor for days like rotten pasta, unwashed and odorous like the rest of my room.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Good. Now let your girlfriend pick a nice shirt for you,&quot; Romin says. He turns to the two girls beyond the door. &quot;He unplugged the phone, can you believe this idiot? I told you we had to save him.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re not . . .&quot; Sylvia mumbles.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You can come in,&quot; I say. My social aversion has no foot in the door against my sudden fear of Romin. And strangely, I find myself a little less empty.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Sylvia&apos;s face is still flushed red. &quot;A shirt . . .&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re the artist. Pick something flashy. We&apos;re getting my boy laid tonight,&quot; Romin says. Sylvia recoils at those words with a certain disgust, bending down to thumb through my limited closet. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No.&quot; Valentina says, &quot;No, no, no, no, no. This isn&apos;t just a &apos;guys night out.&apos; This is a night for us.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, one of us is getting laid tonight, at least,&quot; Romin says. &quot;Who&apos;s it going to be?&quot;</p>",

He turns to Sylvia and Valentina. &quot;You deserve a good celebration for how hard you&apos;ve fought to be Valedictorian, and you deserve to know how the three of us&mdash;&quot; he gestures towards them and they nod&mdash; &quot;feel strongly about you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Heat thaws my heart a little further. I smile, genuinely, putting aside the anxieties of the unsettled life I&apos;ll be leaving behind. Either way, I&apos;ll be figuring it out later. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks, guys. Let&apos;s get going then,&quot; I say. &quot;Like you said. This is a night to remember.&quot;</p>",

We exchange pleasantries, planning as if there were a future time we could ever get back together again.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll have to take you in for some questioning since you&apos;re a person of interest,&quot; they say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Anger and sadness clash in his mind until a single emotion wins over. He lifts himself to his feet, and I&apos;m reminded of how scrawny he&apos;s become since his days as a guard: hardly eating, just enough to keep the shop running, just to stoke the continuous dream. &quot;Alright,&quot; he mutters. &quot;But you&apos;ll get nothing. Nothing! Years serving this city, and when I retire, all you do is forget and screw me over!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The scene clears out after half an hour. Clean-up crews still sort through the wreckage: it looks as if someone dumped a large bag of charcoal in a warehouse-sized firepit. And for the first time in years, not a single light glows in the window of Clint&apos;s shop&mdash;not in the reflection of the trinkets, not the military surplus gear, nor the shimmer from his reading spectacles when he does some accounting at the lonely desk facing the window.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The news filters through slow as molasses throughout the day, and observations bleed in crimson ink across the headlines. It began as reports on the burning of the property: the smoldering blaze that lasted for hours. City patrol said the fire started from inside the property, from a room in the basement, spreading outwards until the warehouse collapsed on itself like a house of cards, and the descending flurries of snow were no match for it. The cold gusts of air had naught a chance to put it out either &mdash; and it was left in ashen ruins until evening before crews sorted through the rubble.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It was then and only then that the source of the fire was discovered, along with the bodies, charred black to a crisp as if the Chymaerans had sucked the life from them, but scalding burns alone weren&apos;t the only abuse these bodies had taken, stab wounds so deep the fusing of flesh in the combustion failed to mend their skin together, some entry wounds so deep they penetrated all the way through the bodies.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The cadavers&apos; clothes were entirely singed off, but the metallic melted plates fused on their shoulders, and it was this fact alone that revealed their identity. The same plates I wore when I was an early cadet in their combat training schools. The same plates Romin wore to the academy sometimes when a &quot;family job&quot; ran long and went all night, it was the symbol of the Carmine: the same insignia proudly worn by nearly ten percent of Blackwater (or those courageous enough to show their colors in public.) It isn&apos;t until the morning after that Romin&apos;s tirade explains the rest.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Those sons of bitches! I told them it was a setup,&quot; Romin shouts. &quot;Those Vermillion bastards killed them . . . &quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Carmine compound swarms with activity. They&apos;re armed for war. Caches of weapons are brandished from their crates and the courtyards flood with faces I&apos;ve never seen, every able-bodied soldier coaxed from the woodwork. If there&apos;s one thing our city is good at, it&apos;s spreading news like wildfire&mdash;where daily news drops like the Firebrands beyond the walls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And the only reason this all happens, the only reason it&apos;s possible for the Carmine to get in? Because they own the place. And they were only kids. Kids of the Carmine officers who were unloading boxes for allowance money.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My father sold the damn place behind my back and didn&apos;t even tell me about it, which cuts me deeper than the possibility of it being insurance fraud in the first place. After extensive interrogation, he was absolved of being a suspect of the crime. And he can&apos;t sink any lower in the list of people I don&apos;t trust, even lower than Romin hiding cards under the table when we gamble for money on the weekends.</p>",

Imagine, just imagine... imagine if that was Ellie in there, dead, all for nothing, not even seizing any of our product, all just for murder, all for blood, all just to send a damn message or, I don&apos;t know, just to . . .&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin. Just think about this for a minute before you do something you&apos;ll regret.&quot; He appears almost twice as big when he&apos;s angry and agreeing with him might exacerbate his livid anger. &quot;Why would the Merlot do this?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because it was them! Their gear. Their foot soldiers left it in the wreckage.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But what would even trigger this?&quot; I ask. &quot;Think, Romin, what reason would they have? You understand people better than I do.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin scoffs. His fists clench in tight boulders. &quot;So a setup? Who else than the Merlot would dare try to stop us? They&apos;ve had it out for us ever since we decided to protect the people and resist against their draconian bloody laws.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It just doesn&apos;t feel right,&quot; I tell him, but his anger eclipses any hope of sensibility in his mind: it&apos;s a natural state for him, and after years of skirmishes with the Merlot, their entire brotherhood is far from forgiveness. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We need more bombings to show them who really runs the city. Shoot first, ask questions later&mdash;give the enemy some dead to mourn before we talk,&quot; Romin says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Only my father and grandfather remember the riots from before I was born. Five percent of the properties in the city were reduced to ashes. It was only several leaders&apos; houses that they targeted, but the perfect conditions of wind and heat erupted it into a full firestorm. Shattered glass from the looting scattered across the streets, and there was so much property damage that the entire city shut down for two weeks just to try and recuperate the losses.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I hope nothing rash will come from this burning. But the Carmine are too proud of a people, and so many swarmed the compound with such a strong groupthink it will only take minutes before their rage destroys any chance at dialogue.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Sometimes days stretch on for lifetimes. And in rare moments of chaos like these, sometimes a life&apos;s-worth of action takes place in the space of hours. And regardless of the rage of the Carmine, there&apos;s one piece of news that still bothers me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Academy is determined as the safest place for Firebrands and their families. So many accumulate in the District Twelve square: medical tents once purposed for combat trials used to tend to the grievously injured; faction-aligned Cadets arguing and throwing fists to speak for their anger; authority sheepish and cowardly, unable to suppress the anarchy; but it&apos;s not just us. Not just District Twelve.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The entire city of Blackwater is now under a forced curfew,&quot; a speaker repeats above their heads. &quot;Report to your homes or the nearest safe-designated facility.&quot; It wasn&apos;t just the trade house. I might believe it was the first, but at the same time, hundreds of Carmine properties were set ablaze, traces of Merlot gear singed in the wreckage, and I wonder how they could possibly be so careless to leave it behind.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But I&apos;m not at the Academy. Through streets of soot and smoke I tread onwards, dodging masses of black-covered instigators and homeless and Outwaller desperates getting in on the anarchy, sure to cover any ties to either faction.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s sick,&quot; Clint says. He&apos;s home for the first time in ages. Ellie sits on the couch. She looks sick and pale, sweating profusely, the veins of her flesh almost looking amethyst under the faint light.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Chymaeran Curse. Like Everett,&quot; Clint says, but he&apos;s wrong. I spent years studying the Chymaerans. I&apos;ve spent just as long looking over Sylvia&apos;s shoulder at the medical books.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Not the Curse. This is something I&apos;ve never seen before.&quot; Ellie doesn&apos;t cry or scream. She just sits there, immobile, as if the joints in her bones have been fused together, drawing labored breaths, extinguished of her young energy, and my father and I panic over what to do next.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Damn it! I should have been here. I should have been here,&quot; I say, and Clint turns to offer a word of reassurance, but my mind races. All I can think of is every lecture I&apos;ve ever had. Obsidian skin covers the Chymaera. The Chymaeran Curse leaves the veins Amethyst. Only in the presence of strong Chymaeran energy can this happen, but why can&apos;t I feel it? Or Clint?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Was the door unlocked when you came in?&quot; I ask him.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It was,&quot; he replies, &quot;but you know how Ellie forgets to lock doors. It could have been the caretakers.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Panicked, I rise my feet. All the energy I have with nothing intelligent to do drives me towards anything. &quot;And you found her here?&quot; I ask him. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He nods.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I inspect the floor, but nothing stands out to me: I know nothing of what we&apos;re up against. Merlot suspected of raids on the Carmine. The city in flames, looting, anarchy, but how could the Chymaera influence an internal dispute, when they&apos;re far beyond the walls?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Just then an energy feathers in the air, carrying a scent of ozone I&apos;ve only noticed miles outside the city. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Clint jumps. &quot;No, no, no, stop!&quot; he shouts, and I approach them, only to witness the amethyst spreading faster. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She shivers in her sweat.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Ellie! You&apos;re fine, you&apos;re alright,&quot; Clint reassures her. With nothing I can do, all I can muster is to lean over the couch and helplessly watch. I can feel the invisible source of danger approaching closer, a certain energy that vibrates every particle of my very existence, resonating with the meager essence in my circuits.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The door bursts open, and before either Clint or I can turn around, the intruders announce themselves.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Child Services. We&apos;re taking your daughter to a place where she belongs.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I take in my first glimpse of them: dressed in the sharply-woven threads of Merlotan civil servants, pinkish-red and gold adorned in the accents of their clothing. My teeth nearly chatter when the darktime winds blow in from the street.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;On whose bloody-damn authority?&quot; I ask. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then I think of all the forms Clint pushed on me. Only one person could be responsible for this: the only one who&apos;s passively aware without helping at all.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint, you Gods-damn bastard!&quot; I shout. &quot;You&apos;re the reason they&apos;re here!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I swear to the Gods, Titus,&quot; he says. Holding Ellie, he crumples in what seems like a genuine state of panic, but his lies are always far too convincing.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;There&apos;s four of them. They circle us, and my breath parts in fading clouds. I consider the door behind us is open, but when I turn to look, I realize it has already been shut.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The first dark-haired civil servant drags his finger across the counter. Dust collects between them. And another of them sneezes.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Despicable living conditions,&quot; he says. &quot;Hours spent alone without family, and now your daughter is sick from the cold. We&apos;ve received an endless string of reports.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Like fridging hell you have,&quot; I say. My hands tension to fists, and Clint grows defensive like a cornered rabbit as they approach. &quot;From who?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;From Eliza&apos;s teacher, at the Academy. You didn&apos;t think the girl was smart enough to reach out to a real force of reliable authority?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The four social service members approach as Ellie&apos;s condition worsens, and though I open my mouth, Clint speaks first.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You Merlot home-wreckers aren&apos;t allowed to show up without a notice,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;ve sent nothing!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ve sent more than nothing. Three letters, to be exact.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Clint turns to me, but I beat him to the punch this time. &quot;They&apos;re lying. Not a single letter, not anything, has come to us.&quot; But his face says that he still doesn&apos;t believe me. &quot;Oh, I&apos;m sorry, should I just redirect all the mail to your shop since you practically live there now?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You could try, Titus, just a little bit harder to care for your family!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, when I raise this young girl and you won&apos;t even see her? You haven&apos;t stepped foot in this house in three months!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Three months?&quot; The case worker exclaims. Clint&apos;s face screws up further when we realize I&apos;ve only stirred the pot. &quot;Gods! Poor child.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s coming with us immediately,&quot; the two surrounding my father say. &quot;Give her up. Now.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Over my dead body,&quot; Clint says, but I feel a sickness in my stomach over how all of this adds up. During the riots, at darktime? And not only that, but&mdash;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Who made these reports?&quot; I ask again. I can feel this exchange feathering that line between talk and brutal action, and so I circle left to the fireplace, feeling for cold iron.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Academy teacher.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s my sister&apos;s name again?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;They stumble for answers. &quot;We don&apos;t know all the details. We&apos;re just case workers.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Her name is Ellie. And she goes to Seminary, not the Academy.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I give them a chance to react. At the sight of me brandishing the spade and poker, normal Merlotan desk-jockeys might cower and run or call for backup: not even close to worth their minimum-wage jobs.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But their expressions are hauntingly stoic and unmoved, and my heart jumps when I realize the improbable is real. Before the surprise is dead, I take a hard swing with the spade against the back of one intruder, and I&apos;m surprised when I don&apos;t connect with the bones of the spine.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But it still keels them over, and they cry out in anguish. Three still stand: one to the left and two to the right, reaching within their coats to pull something a true social worker should never have. I take the spade by the butt edge and feel the weight of it, more unbalanced a tool like a hatchet than the poker, and so I swing it out in a full arc, the sharp edge driven perfectly against the breastbone of the left intruder after two clean spins. But like the last, there&apos;s no clang of hardness when it connects. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The two right intruders now brandish iron that shoots, and my mind flips to the rifle Clint stores beneath the bootlegger&apos;s hatch in the kitchen. Too far to reach, I realize, and as I duck for cover behind the couch, Clint rushes up to bash one of the gunman at close range.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The rounds blast through the couch fabric. Our ears ring in close quarters. They won&apos;t shoot Ellie because, for some reason, she&apos;s their reason to be here, so I pilfer an unconscious intruder for the hardware they were packing.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My training reacts before I can. I cock the hammer of the five-round revolver and scope in beneath the couch: Clint&apos;s boots and a stranger&apos;s pop up and down like the generators&apos; pistons in their tangle. My finger hinges once and the revolver jumps. Something bluer than blood blood sprays against the wall, and the non-brandishing bastard fighting my father yelps for a second.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He falls to the ground, and I take a second shot. It digs into the intruder&apos;s shoulder. Clint&apos;s able to overpower him now, but I can visualize the other trigger-happy intruder turning to blast him, so I reach to peek my head above the couch with the handgun. I feel something freezing cold strangle my ankle before I can shoot, and it forces me backwards towards the fireplace. The gun slips from my hand. My head bashes against the brick and fireworks light behind my eyes, while Clint tussles with the bloody bastard on the ground as the other gunman waits for a shot. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It comes to me when I turn back to look at the first one I bashed with the spade, purple blood, darkening flesh like a melting black-wax idol, their true identity made, but it&apos;s too late for the information to be useful.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint, they&apos;re Chymaerans!&quot; I shout.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;That pricey fireplace set mom bought years ago cost extra for three tools instead of two, and I bet Clint would retract his complaining if he saw me reaching for the tongs. The Chymaeran&apos;s grasp is still strong as death and cold as ice. The tongs leap from their hook but fall into the fire, handle-first, and the more I reach, the more I feel a pin-and-needle stabbing pain climb my leg.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Something hard clatters against the floor on the other side of the foyer, and I realize it&apos;s the other gunman&apos;s revolver. They fight hand-to-hand now, and as I reach further, inching my fingers just a little bit more, I feel them reach just enough to wrap around the inside edge of the bent metal. The iron is hot. The other end is scalding red, and when I whip it around to strike in and sizzle the Chymaeran&apos;s flesh, I feel the stabbing pain withdraw.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Clint still fights with the fourth one, and now that the Chymaerans are exposed for what they really are, no holds barred, I can see Clint&apos;s adversary smirk with a twisted grin. Something changes in the attacker&apos;s right arm, reforming to something slender, obsidian, and black. My struggling father doesn&apos;t notice, and it&apos;s far too late to react, though my hands still clasp around the gun.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The slender limb stabs through my father&apos;s chest and he gasps for air, unable to scream. And then it slices again, severing my father&apos;s arm in a swift draw.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;His blood mixes with the purple ooze dyed into the carpet, and when he collapses, choking on the blood saturated in his punctured lung with only one arm to brace it, the crimson trickles down his chin.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Furious, I raise myself to shoot, but my body freezes on a sudden gust of chilling winds. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The door is open again. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A fifth figure with no disguise has already entered, dressed in a black-hooded cloak. I can feel the strength of their Essence. My blood runs from fluid to molasses to ice, and it feels as if the push-pull command of all my muscles fire at once in perfect balance, my finger hinged around the trigger, trapped in that scarce moment before deliverance.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Fridging hell, you two really did a number on them,&quot; a male voice says. &quot;If I wasn&apos;t here, you probably could have made off with her.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Clint sprawls across the carpet I once played on, as still as I am, his wounds cauterized in this moment by solid blood. Neither of us can manage words, but just watch, as the tall stranger passes the dead Chymaerans, walking directly past the path of my gun.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But if you left, you wouldn&apos;t have anywhere to run. Those shitblood Frosthards and Outwallers both freeze the same &mdash; the only difference is what side of the wall they&apos;re on.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can feel every cell of my body scream for oxygen: so still I can&apos;t even feel my own heart. I wonder if it still beats in my chest, and whether by fortune or folly my eyes still fix on my dying father. Both him and his attacker are stuck there like the miniatures from the war games Romin and I used to play as kids.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that he notices my line of sight. &quot;Whether you shoot him or not, your father is still going to die a horrible death.&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can see the anger carved in the opposing Chymaeran&apos;s face, stabbing arms suspended above my father&apos;s heart, trapped in a scene much like the bronzework of the Academy halls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Shoot him or don&apos;t. Either way you&apos;ll weep over your father. These failures are useless to me every time I send them in,&quot; he says, and he lifts Ellie in his arms. &quot;I&apos;m taking her to a place where she&apos;ll have greater purpose than you or your father can ever give her.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I fight my arms so tenaciously to bend, just a little, to turn the muzzle toward her nihilistic captor, but he&apos;s already reached the door with my sister. As soon as the door slams, I feel my body gasp for air, my pointer finger hinge instinctively around the trigger, and the skull-matter of the Chymaeran spray black tar across Moira&apos;s floral wallpaper.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The further the stranger and my sister slip away from the bloodstained room, the faster my father&apos;s stump un-cauterizes, spilling his life even further in a puddle across the floors and all the sheet-covered upholstery.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;His eyes turn upwards, but he has no words for me, staring somewhere else far beyond this world, as if he can see the woman behind the portrait he&apos;s drank to on so many late nights. I curse myself in regret over that last act of hubris in the lofts &mdash; slamming that door shut just as he mustered the courage to share his feelings with me &mdash; and I feel the penetrating saturation of self-hate overtake me with every labored breath. The guilt and regrets seize the words in my throat, but his gaze is suddenly serene, and directed right at me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m covered in my father&apos;s blood. I try to do something&mdash;anything&mdash;as the oxygen slowly returns to my pin-and-needle atrophied muscles. My heart pulses, driving the elixir of life through my veins that leaves Clint by the buckets, and I refuse to accept the brutal fact that there&apos;s nothing I can do to save him.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He watches me panic. He watches me cry, and I feel his red-caked arm weakly grasping my trembling wrist: soft, and I can feel the last moments of his life transferred through the heat.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My first words are the last he&apos;ll hear, and I stumble over them. Apologies. Regrets. The pain of guilt and the irreversibility of how I caused this. I hate myself because I can never be enough, not to anyone, and I abhor that bitter weakness that follows. But the serene look in his eyes gives me pause &mdash; a look of forgiveness, of absolute fatherly love no longer inhibited by his fears and resentment, and then I remember all the best times of my childhood that I repressed, the pride in his eyes, the weight of my light body on his shoulders, the beauty of everything before the blemish in our history that divided us.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I still can&apos;t cry as his eyes glaze over, pointed upwards like forgotten glass marbles fixed to the ceiling by an invisible thread, the lightest grasp of his hand on my shoulder weakening as his body runs dry.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He finally returned home in the end. Now I pray the Gods will take him to the woman he missed for so long. The only thing that burns brighter now than the self-hatred is another force that drags me even further: the liquid heat of revenge and retribution that only I can deliver alone.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The siren wails in the distance, late to answer, and the motif of three shrill tones confirm the terror of what I&apos;ve witnessed.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Chymaerans have breached the walls.</p>",

As panic and anxiety exchange for the long exhaustion of what those emotions cost, I find no catharsis, but that doesn&apos;t surprise me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Sylvia and I find ourselves at the heavily-guarded front door. Mercenaries in pink fill the fields like flowers. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m asking where Valentina is. Valentina Vermillion?&quot; I ask, but the guards are oblivious, as if they refuse to recognize her. </p>",

Vera stands with her full fireteam while we still can&apos;t account for half of ours. Scattered around, the Academy captains stand in as makeshift generals, disseminating commands from higher powers, reminding us of the sanctity of our cause &mdash; defending the Afterlife.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I love you even more now, if I didn&apos;t already love you before,&quot; Sylvia says, as Valentina gains the light of a realization she&apos;s missed for far too long.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve lived my whole life afraid of myself. Now that I&apos;m no longer silenced by the threat of being severed from this family, everything feels a little bit lighter,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;I haven&apos;t stopped thinking about your speech at graduation, Titus, and I know those words came from your soul. We have to let go. Of everything. Of all that pain and feel into it.&quot; </p>",
        "It hurts to know the words were nothing to me, just projections of a higher truth others wanted to hear. But if it can give her genuine strength, I find that&apos;s all that matters."

        "<p>&emsp;We find a strange peace that night. While others camp outside in tents just beyond the property, the three of us remain inside the claustrophobic shed. Sylvia sleeps in the bed with Valentina. I sleep on a bed of hats to keep warm.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The dreams grow stronger, and I&apos;m no longer plagued by the same recurring dream. I dream of the coldness of my father&apos;s figure, still sprawled across the floor somewhere in a pool of his own blood, his glance forever fixed beyond the door I left open. I can feel the regret of his thoughts. From miles away I can sense his soul still wandering the halls of that house he tried to forget, forever waking to open the door of my sister&apos;s room to find she&apos;s been lost. The depth of the red puddle grows. It catches my ankles as I stand over him, and as if it were stretching the edge of a deep lake, I fall into it, unable to paddle.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I suffocate in his crimson shadow.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I thrash for minutes until I&apos;m deprived of energy. My lungs scream for air, but I will my mouth shut. Though oxygen is extinguished, I find that they don&apos;t burn.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I open my eyes to find the water is deep cobalt. There&apos;s no shimmering crest where the water touches the sky, and I feel the pressure of depth without a light to bring me back. There is only a lantern in my hand, its beacon only strong enough to light an arm&apos;s length ahead, and around me, charcoal black stalagmites stab from gravel sedimentation.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The only sensation of touch is something bound to my wrist&mdash;a thread, thin but unbreakable, tensioned to something far beyond the murky depths, and it drags me between the obsidian rocks. A deep acoustic vibration reverberates through the water. I&apos;m being pulled faster. And the louder it gets, the stronger the black statues harmonize. Statues, not stalagmites: the further I go, the more the geometry diminishes in its abstraction, like unfinished sculptures the artist quit after chiseling a general form. I&apos;m dragged faster. The thread digs further into my wrist, stitching my forearm higher and higher, tensioning until I can feel my pulse, but all I can watch are the figures&mdash;so real now, so lifelike&mdash;and they&apos;re no longer trapped to the curse of their rigid medium.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Their arms are reaching for me, still too slow. It&apos;s as if I&apos;m watching evolution in a matter of seconds. Their surfaces so impossibly smooth as if sanded for thousands of years by the persistence of the water, grasping as if I&apos;m the only source of motion that can save them from the darkness.</p>",
        "I can feel them touch with their cold, brutal forms, pleading: their voices now audible, and now I know the source of those vibrations that were once so far away. But the thread doesn&apos;t allow me to stop, to do anything. It drags me, onward, until the tension is unbearable, until the drag of the water is so strong I feel as if my arm will sever, and I can feel myself passing out, unable to hold on to consciousness while the thread stitches my entire arm, and so I let go."

        "<p>&emsp;I awake to Valentina, her face flushed with panic, staring beyond the grated cellar window at the commotion. Her ears twitch as she trembles, focus attuned to something indiscernible. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Sylvia is still asleep. It&apos;s only several hours that we&apos;ve been out. We slept so peacefully with no anticipation: though it&apos;s anger that fuels the lower riots, most Firebrands believe our orders to be a temporary endeavor. Even my own mind begins to slip over the possibility of the Chymaerans breaching the city. Had it all been a hallucination? Was it some other external force that took my sister away? I know for sure they weren&apos;t Merlot or Carmine mercenaries, as they were draped in all black.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m still uncertain of when I&apos;ll tell them. I don&apos;t think I will. All my fears are just a drop in the sea of anxious faces &mdash; that all of Blackwater is far too deep to surface from.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus,&quot; she whispers, &quot;are you awake?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. What?&quot; I ask. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She motions for me to approach the window. &quot;Are the Firebrands supposed to leave their tents? There&apos;s a bunch of them walking around. The lights aren&apos;t even on in there anymore.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Probably because they&apos;re all asleep,&quot; I say. But wait. No, they couldn&apos;t all be asleep. Some have to be on night watch. Although my eyes have already adjusted to the darkness, I struggle to determine what walks the grounds. It&apos;s as if the figures themselves are made of darkness. The lights are out. I begin to wonder if a quiet force swept through all the tents, when I hear a faint voice calling out to them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A sleepless Firebrand strides from the house to the lawn, and his voice piques with recognition. &quot;Erik. It&apos;s not your shift yet,&quot; he says. &quot;What are you doing up?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The other figure doesn&apos;t reply. I can&apos;t even see them from the frame of the thick stone window, though I can tell they&apos;re approaching.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Say something, you idiot,&quot; he says. &quot;Are you still giving me the silent treatment because I stole some of your rations? Whoa, Erik, what&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Silence. The Firebrand falls. Valentina gasps, covering her mouth. My heart skips a beat, and I step back, but something bothers me. I wasn&apos;t afraid by the severance of that cadet&apos;s speech, but the way he fell over. It didn&apos;t look as if anything had struck him. He didn&apos;t fall flat. He didn&apos;t crumple. His body didn&apos;t react in any way I expected, but rather as if it were amorphous, made of some tar-like substance. Memory of the term &quot;Black Bile&quot; flashes into my mind &mdash; a phrase Ellie&apos;s captors spoke before taking her. It&apos;s like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before, no way to explain it. And the unnatural silence falls on us once again before Valentina slams the window and rushes to lock everything separating this space from the outside world.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Up already?&quot; Sylvia mumbles, turning from her sleep. All she finds in us is the stillness of confusion, and I watch her heart jump into her throat.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What did we just see?&quot; Valentina asks. &quot;What was that . . . thing? That cadet was there and then he was gone before he could even finish his sentence.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It was fluid. He didn&apos;t bend or crumple, it&apos;s like he just . . . dissolved, or melted,&quot; Valentina says, and Sylvia sits there, confused, having expected nothing of our excursion to the Vermillion estate. &quot;But there&apos;s hundreds of cadets out there! How could it slip through all of them? Whatever this is&mdash;how couldn&apos;t they shout, not even one of them detect it?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Just then, a shrill scream reverberates from somewhere beyond the walls. Inhuman. It reminds me of the bloodcurdling sound foxes make, almost like human voices, but just different enough to feel the fear of its distortion, and in that instant I&apos;m so thankful we decided to sleep here. We&apos;re safe. For now, though none of us know the adversary that surrounds us.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We need to get out of here,&quot; Sylvia says, gathering her things in a frenzied rush.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Absolutely not! We need to stay here. Until help arrives,&quot; Valentina insists. Or until lighttime, until we can tell what we&apos;re up against.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s everywhere. It&apos;s all around us, I can feel it,&quot; Sylvia says, &quot;can&apos;t you feel it? The smell of ozone?&quot; And then I notice the texture of the air. The smell of the Chymaera, of something foul and sickening growing stronger.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The lift. The lift,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;They said tomorrow, our family would be taking it to the upper lands. We just have to tough it out until then.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And you didn&apos;t tell us this before?&quot; I say. &quot;You all just expected to leave everyone behind. Let them all just die?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We couldn&apos;t expect anything like this! It was just until the riots were over. The Afterlife protects the Merlot. My family is their messengers, their enforcers, their distributors of nutrition and power.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Guys&mdash;&quot; Sylvia says, stopping our argument before it can start.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;How do we know this is affecting the whole city? What if this is what they wanted us to defend against, but we just didn&apos;t know it, they didn&apos;t tell us?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That doesn&apos;t matter. We need to get to that lift before it leaves,&quot; Sylvia says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Just then, a siren cracks the air. Flashing lights cast the landscape in blinding white, reflecting the snow as we watch beyond the southern windows. A slight incline affords us the smallest glimpse of the city. The iron gates are indiscernible. A black boulder rests where no earthly object stood before, and we see it between frames of strobe light like a silent picture. Now it&apos;s fluid. Pieces split from it. They grow arms. The masses evolve in seconds to whatever structure best suits them, and they rush towards the source of the sound.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods! Damn it!&quot; Valentina shouts, her voice drowned out by the droning of the siren, and in her betrayal, I realize what that sound represents. Her arms lash at the pieces of her wardrobe scattered across the floor. Sylvia and I do the same. Val seems uncertain of what she&apos;s looking for, until she struggles to lift a large metal grate from the floor. &quot;This is our only way out. Hurry. Those . . . bastards can&apos;t leave without us,&quot; she says, between breaths. My back cramps as we lift the heavy iron. Below is a drainage tunnel, a little large to drain such a small space. But considering the scandals of wealthy life and Lord Vermillion&apos;s taste for affairs, I don&apos;t question it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina drops in. Her boots clatter against concrete, and instead of waiting for the three of us to replace the grate, she storms off, just as Sylvia inches herself below the ledge.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I shout. &quot;Valentina, wait!&quot; but she&apos;s already disappeared into the darkness, and I jump straight in without grasping the sides. All I can hear is the echo of her frantic footfalls. I call for her, until breathing her name subtracts the air I need to sprint for her. Sylvia follows somewhere behind me. All that reverberates is the faint droning of the siren, growing louder as we approach. When darkness engulfs us, we fumble for the walls, and I hear the splash of her boots between bursts.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A light crests the end of the tunnel, flashing, though too far away to distinguish any of our immediate obstacles. My breath tastes like poison. Sylvia grasps the back of my coat, asking nonverbally to lead her from this place.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I call for her one last time before I make a blind dash. Physical obstructions can&apos;t stop me. All I can think of is losing a cherished friend beyond just Ellie and Clint, what terrible things might befall her, and after the death of my father, watching his soul squeezed from the narrow vessel of his body, the fear of losing others overrides the anxieties of my own life.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I stumble over boulders and rocks and curse the uneven corridors. My knees and shins are shredded by shear stone, though Sylvia still follows behind me, almost keeping the same pace. I can see her silhouette. We&apos;re so close to the end. The flashing is brighter, it covers more of the tunnel, and I can see the faint stream of still wastewater glimmer, hear the weight of Valentina steps as she sets the water in disturbance.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The sounds are deafening, echoing until the alarm is a droning scream. I reach out for her. My hand slips: a sting pierces my nerves when I realize my hands are sliced to hell, but I keep running. She&apos;s right there, and I can even hear her crying, sniffles between breaths as she chokes over mucus from crying and exhaustion.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We&apos;re too late. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The great trolley is reduced to the size of a fist in the distance, climbing the hill like a landslide in reverse. Four Vermillions peak from the railing, silhouetted by cabin light, and one smokes a cigar.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m still your daughter,&quot; Valentina whispers. She falls to her knees in the mud, face saturated in streaks of dirt as she watches her betrayal. Her exhaustion trades for helplessness, unable to find the motivation to take another step, now fully stripped of that identity she so reluctantly held to with a white-knuckle grasp.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But whatever the tar is, and whatever form it takes, we can feel it approaching. The Merlot were never interested in saving Blackwater, nor in managing it. And for a moment I think I understand completely. They were only emissaries of the Afterlife because of a promise to be saved. But it only takes moments before I&apos;m proven wrong again.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The shockwaves of a distant pop crest our eardrums before the hillside glows orange. Flaming refuse cascades from above. Screeching metal screams as it tears, obliterating the tracks, tearing like a caught hangnail ripping the flesh of the stark earth.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina&apos;s eyes glow jade green as she rises to her feet. I watch the wreckage reach a standstill, as if suspended in place, the fire no longer flickering, as if it were painted there with luminescent acrylic, unable to move. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Humans have the powers of life and fire; Chymaerans of frost and death. But Ahkvasans, from all the forbidden tales my grandfather read to me &mdash; can manipulate the fabric of something different.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Time halts to a near standstill, as if fate wills us a chance to escape. The air around me is too slow to draw in my lungs and produce words as Sylvia and I halt our momentum to turn around, but Valentina has fully risen, and her emerald glare penetrates us.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The tears stream from her eyes. I realize she has no intention of leaving this place, and I have no power to persuade her. Snuffed of purpose or attachment, she reaches her arms towards us, giving us all the push we need to change our direction and dive for the tunnel. The refuse cascades from the skies before we can reach to save her. She allows the weight of her family above to crush her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Time returns when the hard parts of her crack and she is gone forever. Entombed in her family&apos;s steel duplicity, we never find her, without time to search or bury what&apos;s left.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A sound of rustling grasses comes from behind us, and then a whisper: whether they&apos;re hushed voices or the Black Bile, we have no way to know. I reach for my sword, only to realize I left it behind in the rush, along with everything else that might aid me. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;All I hear is a cry, and I look to Sylvia. Despite the wetness of the rain, reducing her hair to strands of silken black, she sheds no tears, and her chest doesn&apos;t rise or fall. She just stands there, staring in disbelief, as if trying to figure out how she could reverse what just happened.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then it&apos;s several footfalls. The anxiety swells within me, the fight or flight, and I can only think of that ashen adversary drawing closer, panicking over what I might do, wondering what ungodly form it might take, and I grab a severed, rusty bar from the lip of the drainage pipe, hands trembling, unsure of how I&apos;ll even use it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It gets closer, but it sounds like multiple. They get closer. My grip tightens, and I raise the sharp edge, slinking back into the tunnel, knowing the element of surprise is the only leverage I might have, ready to jump, just as Sylvia does the same.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then they&apos;re voices, disjointed, incapable of full sentences. Maybe the tar still holds the minds of their hosts &mdash; their horrific intonation leaves gooseflesh on my body.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;As soon as it breaks the edge I lunge for it, and it whips around, sword in hand, bashing the metal pipe against the stone wall. It clatters from my grasp, and I&apos;m defenseless. And as I reach to pummel with my right fist, I halt when I see the face of the short figure standing in front of me. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Her face flushes of tension. </p>",
        "&quot;Isla,&quot; I whisper."

        "<p>&emsp;The shockwaves of a distant pop crest our eardrums before the hillside glows orange. Flaming refuse cascades from above. Screeching metal screams as it tears, obliterating the tracks, tearing like a caught hangnail ripping the flesh of the stark earth.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina&apos;s eyes glow jade green as she rises to her feet. I watch the wreckage reach a standstill, as if suspended in place, the fire no longer flickering, as if it were painted there with luminescent acrylic, unable to move. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Humans have the powers of life and fire; Chymaerans of frost and death. But Ahkvasans, from all the forbidden tales my grandfather read to me &mdash; can manipulate the fabric of something different.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Time halts to a near standstill, as if fate wills us a chance to escape. The air around me is too slow to draw in my lungs and produce words as Sylvia and I halt our momentum to turn around, but Valentina has fully risen, and her emerald glare penetrates us.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The tears stream from her eyes. I realize she has no intention of leaving this place, and I have no power to persuade her. Snuffed of purpose or attachment, she reaches her arms towards us, giving us all the push we need to change our direction and dive for the tunnel. The refuse cascades from the skies before we can reach to save her. She allows the weight of her family above to crush her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Time returns when the hard parts of her crack and she is gone forever. Entombed in her family&apos;s steel duplicity, we never find her, without time to search or bury what&apos;s left.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A sound of rustling grasses comes from behind us, and then a whisper: whether they&apos;re hushed voices or the Black Bile, we have no way to know. I reach for my sword, only to realize I left it behind in the rush, along with everything else that might aid me. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;All I hear is a cry, and I look to Sylvia. Despite the wetness of the rain, reducing her hair to strands of silken black, she sheds no tears, and her chest doesn&apos;t rise or fall. She just stands there, staring in disbelief, as if trying to figure out how she could reverse what just happened.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then it&apos;s several footfalls. The anxiety swells within me, the fight or flight, and I can only think of that ashen adversary drawing closer, panicking over what I might do, wondering what ungodly form it might take, and I grab a severed, rusty bar from the lip of the drainage pipe, hands trembling, unsure of how I&apos;ll even use it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It gets closer, but it sounds like multiple. They get closer. My grip tightens, and I raise the sharp edge, slinking back into the tunnel, knowing the element of surprise is the only leverage I might have, ready to jump, just as Sylvia does the same.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then they&apos;re voices, disjointed, incapable of full sentences. Maybe the tar still holds the minds of their hosts &mdash; their horrific intonation leaves gooseflesh on my body.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;As soon as it breaks the edge I lunge for it, and it whips around, sword in hand, bashing the metal pipe against the stone wall. It clatters from my grasp, and I&apos;m defenseless. And as I reach to pummel with my right fist, I halt when I see the face of the short figure standing in front of me. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Her face flushes of tension. </p>",
        "&quot;Isla,&quot; I whisper."

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s gone . . .&quot; Isla says, but she&apos;s not speaking of Valentina.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It was all so quick,&quot; Jarrett says. Only the two of them are left. &quot;I woke up. Delvin was shouting, saying he had something on him, and I told him to shut up and stop wasting my sleep. But it was so quiet. Not a light beyond our tent, and not even Isla and Vera&apos;s made any sound. That&apos;s when I turned the light on, and realized the smell, the sight of how badly the tar had already infected him, like nothing I had ever seen before. It had his legs. He felt nothing of it, the whole time it ate him away, and he was unable to lift himself, and as soon as he realized, all he could do was scream.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Isla interjects. &quot;That scream saved my life. I awoke to Vera missing, and it&apos;s only now that I realize what she did to us.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That bitch!&quot; Jarrett says, swelling with anger just like Romin does. &quot;Never told us of her plan to escape, and she had all the time in the world. She didn&apos;t care about us living through this, only interested in herself and her family.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And I bet Valentina did too, right?&quot; Isla says, as I gather the last of my things.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Sylvia responds. &quot;She didn&apos;t. She was left behind, too.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Are you serious? But why?&quot; Isla asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because her family never cherished her like we do,&quot; Sylvia says. Her look is somber as she raises Valentina&apos;s crimson scarf, the one she wore for years to keep her from the blistering cold, and she wraps it around herelf, taking in the scent of Valentina&apos;s perfume as if Valentina could hug her one last time.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Isla and Jarrett nod, not probing any further. Jarrett changes the subject. &quot;So where&apos;s Brother Romin?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Missing,&quot; I tell him. &quot;So drowned in his rage over the trade building that he never answered the call to the Merlot. Have you heard anything from the District Twelve Carmine?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Not a thing. I haven&apos;t even heard anything from my family, and I spent all night processing that panic,&quot; Jarrett says. He&apos;s the only one with the stomach to turn his eyes back towards the wreckage, whatever parts of the Vermillion family remain after the explosion.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He mutters something indiscernible when something catches his eye, and he bends down to lift a piece of the metallic rubble.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What is it, Jarrett?&quot; Isla asks. Just as Jarrett takes the shard of ferric debris in his hands, he winces, dropping it back into the scalding pile of scrap.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Essenced explosives. Not just saltpeter mixed in here, but I don&apos;t get it &mdash; the Carmine would never waste this much Essence.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;These are Carmine explosives,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;The plating is our Essence-infused carbon steel. The only box that can hold that much Essence is one made of Essence itself.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;His words make my thoughts stretch further on where Romin has been, and Sylvia ponders the same question. &quot;Is he . . . really capable of such a thing?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But Isla refocuses us. &quot;Capable or not, that&apos;s not important right now. We have to press for the Afterlife. The inner walls should protect us. In fact, I bet all the survivors are headed there. We press into the city, we&apos;re as good as dead &mdash; if you figure that Chymaeran creature&apos;s taken the life of everyone down there, just at our greatest moment of weakness.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But what will we find at the top, then?&quot; I ask.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter. We have no other choice. We can only concentrate our forces on one goal, and this is the best option,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;We idle and we die. Assume that Endogeny is driven by life power &mdash; by Essence, and it needs it to survive. The only direction it could possibly travel is towards the Afterlife. Those Chymaeran bastards probably planned this all along, just to destroy the whole city and turn it against itself.&quot;</p>",
        "&quot;Let&apos;s go then,&quot; I say. I take Valentina&apos;s Vermillion rifle, knowing she has no further use for it. Sylvia steadies her bow and prepares her quiver, loaded with Essenced arrows that deliver a punch far stronger than a bullet, the only feature that makes it worthwhile. Though we play a losing game, having lost so much before the start, all we can do is press on in the memory of the ones we&apos;ve lost. The voice from my dreams is still so strong, and I still feel the tension in my wrist."

Some of the minions panic, but their leader is adamant. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;His fingers touch the lever. &quot;We&apos;re the ones with the upper hand here, not you,&quot; he says. &quot;For all we know, you&apos;re those skin-walkers. Maybe you took the cloaks of Dragon Class and pose as them. We already know they&apos;ve infiltrated the city long before this.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t act like you don&apos;t know, Chymaeran,&quot; he says. I feel an anger twist in me. &quot;A friend I knew for years turned on me.&quot; He shows a scar across his lower torso. &quot;Tried to kill me as soon as things went south, until I killed him first. So don&apos;t think we&apos;re too weak to kill a threat that talks like an ally.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re insane,&quot; Isla says. &quot;Cut your stupid power trip and let us in, that&apos;s an order, Garnet Class,&quot; but he refuses. She only makes the situation worse.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;One of the Cadets pipes up. &quot;Hey &mdash;&quot; she says, &quot;isn&apos;t that the Valedictorian? From graduation? What&apos;s his name . . .&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot; Several nod, and she turns to their edgy leader. &quot;How else would they know that?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They walk among us. Remember that friend of mine &mdash; they say they even steal their host&apos;s memories.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Sylvia gasps as she looks at the ground. I follow her gaze, and my stomach crumples at the horror of her realization. At least a third of the corpses were actual cadets &mdash; people whose lives they gambled with, and I realize we are reasoning with immoral psychopaths.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;How to convince them, I think. None of the others understand. This bastard just wants power, so how do I give it to him? Or how do I make it crumble?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Fear. Fear is how you do it, I think.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;Endogeny is right behind us&mdash;the Chymaeran black bile. That&apos;s why we&apos;re out of breath. We could see it after we packed up camp this morning.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Bullshit,&quot; he says. The cadets grow uncomfortable.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But do you know anything of how to defeat it? Do any of you know its weakness? How to defend against it? It tore through a whole battalion of Dragon Class cadets in a single night. And you&apos;re all doomed to die if you don&apos;t get our help,&quot; I say. I sow further fear. &quot;All of you are weak. You&apos;d piss your pants before you drew your sword or rifle.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But we can&apos;t risk it!&quot; He says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s a risk you can&apos;t afford to take. Would you rather die in an hour or have a chance to live longer? Kill us, and you lose that knowledge. We&apos;re the only ones that survived it. It will liquidate your forces and dissolve you away just like your families,&quot; I say, making sure my face is adamant with rage and resolve.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No. You&apos;re not the leader here&mdash;&quot; he says, but the cadets overtake his power. Beyond his words, he has nothing. He tries defending the lever, grasping on to it as if it were a lone branch in a torrential river, but their forces overpower them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The portcullis opens, just a hair. The stabbing edges rise from the dirt, just enough for us to crawl under, as their demoted leader is forced away. The cadets draw their weapons, trembling, pointing them at us. The truth is that we&apos;re all just kids that have never seen war, only weapons and training. I doubt any of them have the courage to pull the trigger &mdash; all bark and no bite.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What the hell were you doing?&quot; a voice shouts, its figure emerging from a makeshift bedroom inside the walls. A Dragon-Class cloak shimmers. &quot;I make you second-in-command and you raise hell on a power trip. Send this traitor out of here. Go, force him!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The lower-level cadets drag him like subservient ants. He thrashes. They knock him unconscious.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Rank isn&apos;t anything anymore,&quot; he says. His eyes constantly pass between the guards standing at the front of the tent, noticing how they listen in, knowing he must put on a good show regardless of the cost, thinking it&apos;s the only way he can hold on to whatever he has. &quot;Nothing is left of that past world. All we have is this.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s been three days, Romin! It&apos;s way too early to dive into total anarchy. Let us lead together.&quot;</p>",

We still don&apos;t know if you&apos;re Chymaerans or not. Don&apos;t forget that,&quot; he says, and a twinge of resentment sounds in his voice that only I can notice, but he hushes that sound in fear that all the others can hear.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He looks again to his &apos;guards&apos; in front of the tent &mdash; I notice he pinned two of the Dragon Class rubies from his mark on their chest. I scoff: no matter what, ego and honor always win.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;In fact, I want you to take these three away,&quot; Romin says, pointing to the rest of our surrogate fireteam. His eyes don&apos;t even meet Sylvia&apos;s. I can tell his fa\u00e7ade is breaking, and he doesn&apos;t want the others to witness it.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Understood,&quot; his minion says. The three refuse to protest &mdash; they know the sheer volume of frightened soldiers that would jump at anything to take commands, to feel even a fraction of direction.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Good luck defusing his power trip,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;Romin. You bring shame to the First Blood of the Carmine.&quot; He spits, but Romin&apos;s face is resolute, staring directly at me. New &apos;guards&apos; cycle to the front of the tent, but he dismisses them.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;He doesn&apos;t respond. He&apos;s already made up his mind, and though his bottom lip quivers, he doesn&apos;t want to waver.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;How the fridging hell did you even get here?&quot; I ask him. &quot;You never came to the Academy. We were so worried about you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You left me, just to replace me with them. Am I that replaceable?&quot; he asks. &quot;Am I that forgettable?&quot; Like a toddler abandoned by his parents for several minutes, craving attention.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;I scoff. &quot;Live with what, Romin?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But he continues on. &quot;My mission was assigned down in the city. In fact &mdash; we all were. As the only Dragon Class cadet there, the leadership decided that I was in charge. We defend this foothold of the Upper Lands. Against anyone.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So why do you treat us like this? We&apos;ve been friends for years. You explored beyond the walls with me. You saved me from my room, days ago, when I was too depressed to leave. You&apos;re the one who&apos;s acting the impostor.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;To lead men, you have to rule with an iron fist. You have to do the unspeakable things that no one else will do. You have to show that strength to them, that resiliency to moral nature in the interest of protection, and reinforce it in them, so that they never question you. We&apos;ve entered a time of war. There is no Carmine anymore. There is no Merlot. No . . . Valentina,&quot; his voice wavers, but he corrects it as soon as he can. &quot;All that&apos;s left is the wolves and the sheep. And I am their shepherd.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I remember the non-Chymaeran bodies just past the gates, and my stomach twists. &quot;It was you, then. You had those innocent cadets killed! Why?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because it&apos;s us versus them.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What is that supposed to mean?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It needs to be us versus them. With no them, there&apos;s no us. The enemy needs a face. These weak soldiers need a &apos;them.&apos; And if that means . . .&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Killing innocent cadets? Sentencing them to death just because you&apos;re afraid? Creating a wild witch hunt to stir chaos, and make them need a leader? That makes you a coward.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; Romin says. &quot;It makes me smart. Fear is the strongest emotion, and if my soldiers rest on the precipice of that fear of death, they will never question me. Only then do they find unity.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re just an egotistical coward,&quot; I tell him. I bend over the wooden board, and he stands up in response. &quot;Let us lead together. Please, Romin. You don&apos;t have to do this alone.&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I finally have what I&apos;ve always wanted, and you just want to take it away!&quot; His face screws up, as if he&apos;s on the verge of tears. He regains control when his anger wins over, and he hushes his voice before the distant cadets can hear the weakness in his outburst. &quot;I don&apos;t want to have to decide between the both of you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t have to, Romin,&quot; I say. &quot;You can have both. You can have leadership and friends. Great leaders are loved.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Great leaders are feared,&quot; he says. A quick onset of panic rises when he notices his minions have turned around, catching him in a moment of weakness. &quot;And I&apos;m sorry I have to do this.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I only manage a single world. &quot;You&mdash;&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Take this . . . Chymaeran . . . to the prison,&quot; he says, refusing to look me in the eyes as blood spouts from my nose.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The guard pauses. &quot;But shouldn&apos;t we just desert them out there? If they&apos;re Chymaerans? That makes no sense.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Just do it.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s time now, cadets!&quot; he says. He stands atop a makeshift stage of fruit crates. &quot;Now is the time where we fight. The enemy waits at the gates. We must meet them before they destroy us!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What is he talking about? Is he talking about going out there?&quot; Sylvia says, as Isla reaches for the keys. She shifts herself. She&apos;s so close.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I can&apos;t reach it,&quot; Isla says. &quot;It&apos;s too far.&quot; And then I see a stick just beyond the ground-level window.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Use this,&quot; I tell her. I toss it through the bars, and she grabs for it. She reaches for the key ring, trying to hook it. The rest hold their breath. I watch my friend rally a hundred cadets in martyrdom.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Step forward if you&apos;re courageous. Step back if you&apos;re a coward. This means almost certain death, but you&apos;ll be sacrificing for the betterment of our people, the key tenant of our Academy,&quot; he says. Several step forward. Isla&apos;s arms atrophy.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My words can do nothing behind these bars. My heart drops when cadets open the gates. The crowd is divided in two groups of trembling firebrands, about one-to-four, and Romin stirs their emotions further.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Ah!&quot; Isla exclaims. The keys are in her hands. She fumbles her fingers against the lock and it opens.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You first. You&apos;re the only one that can stop him,&quot; she tells me. The door clicks, and she throws the iron grate aside. I hear Romin&apos;s cry drown out as it grows further. Endogeny is approaching, and it will spare no one &mdash; not even these cadets with tombstone courage.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I break the top of the stairs, heaving, clearing great distance as quickly as my legs will allow me. They&apos;re passing under. The final split is nearly half and half. Hundreds of cadets are going to die just so Romin can feel his last moment of glory. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Stop! Stop, all of you! This isn&apos;t courage or glory. We fight with our minds, not just our hearts!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Only several of them stop, the ones that just broke the line of the gates. I watch their eyes. They see something unspeakable approaching, and then their natural instinct of self-preservation finally kicks in.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Lower the gates!&quot; one cries.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No, wait!&quot; the others beyond the walls scream. But it&apos;s too late. The heavy metal gates are already down. Several of them try to climb, to gain whatever height they can as if the floor were molten lava. All the wise can do is watch as their friends trample over each other, regretting their final decision.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You cowards,&quot; Romin shouts. It&apos;s dark, but I can see him weep. &quot;You have no honor. You have no courage! If you die, you will be remembered! You will live forever in the hearts of our people.&quot; But he&apos;s the only one standing that far beyond the walls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Open the bloody damn gates,&quot; I command. The others hesitate, so I do it myself, just enough that the scrambling cadets can roll through. &quot;Several at a time, or you all will die.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We can only save twenty before the great cancer Endogeny is too close. My hand trembles on the lever, and I curse Romin for his idiocy in leveraging such a terrible situation on me. When do I lower it? There are still so many that struggle. They&apos;re like rats desperate to escape a flooded drain tunnel. If I don&apos;t lower it now, the rest of us will all die for nothing.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Lower the gates already, it&apos;s going to kill us!&quot; Jarrett shouts, but I&apos;m stuck in indecision.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The stranded cadets screech with bloodcurdling cries. I close my eyes, unable to watch the horror as I throw the lever. I hear the cracking of bones. I can hear their screams drown out as the spiked edge of the massive gate lowers on them, while the ones still alive cry, reaching through the bars, resorting back to climbing as they curse me, condemning with the last of their souls as they&apos;re marked for death.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Tears crest my eyes, and I fall to my knees. The hate grows stronger, and I want to die here. I couldn&apos;t save them, not all of them. I wish so strongly that the ground could swallow me whole. I anticipate a death so painful that it could repay just a fraction of those lives I&apos;ve sacrificed, wishing I was among them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then I feel her embrace. Sylvia hugs me. Though her warmth can&apos;t penetrate the depth of my loathing, all I can do is rest there, deprived of the desire to rise from the frostbitten ground, and she raises me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The cadets I saved join her. They stand around me. Hands rest on my shoulders. They thank me for what I&apos;ve done.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s time now, cadets!&quot; he says. He stands atop a makeshift stage of fruit crates. &quot;Now is the time where we fight. The enemy waits at the gates. We must meet them before they destroy us!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What is he talking about? Is he talking about going out there?&quot; Sylvia says, as Isla reaches for the keys. She shifts herself. She&apos;s so close.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s suicide,&quot; Jarrett says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;All he wants is to be a martyr. All he wants is glory,&quot; I say, &quot;and he&apos;s about to take a hundred cadets unless we stop him.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin beckons with his rallying cry. The cadets respond with nervous cheers, adrenaline eclipsing their fears of death, if only for a moment. They want so badly to be led, to feel a part of something, even if it means until the bitter end, but I refuse to let that happen.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I can&apos;t reach it,&quot; Isla says. &quot;It&apos;s too far.&quot; And then I see a stick just beyond the ground-level window.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Use this,&quot; I tell her. I toss it through the bars, and she grabs for it. She reaches for the key ring, trying to hook it. The rest hold their breath. I watch my friend rally a hundred cadets in martyrdom.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Step forward if you&apos;re courageous. Step back if you&apos;re a coward. This means almost certain death, but you&apos;ll be sacrificing for the betterment of our people, the key tenant of our Academy,&quot; he says. Several step forward. Isla&apos;s arms atrophy.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My words can do nothing behind these bars. My heart drops when cadets open the gates. The crowd is divided in two groups of trembling firebrands, about one-to-four, and Romin stirs their emotions further.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Ah!&quot; Isla exclaims. The keys are in her hands. She fumbles her fingers against the lock and it opens.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You first. You&apos;re the only one that can stop him,&quot; she tells me. The door clicks, and she throws the iron grate aside. I hear Romin&apos;s cry drown out as it grows further. Endogeny is approaching, and it will spare no one &mdash; not even these cadets with tombstone courage.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I break the top of the stairs, heaving, clearing great distance as quickly as my legs will allow me. They&apos;re passing under. The final split is nearly half and half. Hundreds of cadets are going to die just so Romin can feel his last moment of glory. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Stop! Stop, all of you! This isn&apos;t courage or glory. We fight with our minds, not just our hearts!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Only several of them stop, the ones that just broke the line of the gates. I watch their eyes. They see something unspeakable approaching, and then their natural instinct of self-preservation finally kicks in.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Lower the gates!&quot; one cries.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No, wait!&quot; the others beyond the walls scream. But it&apos;s too late. The heavy metal gates are already down. Several of them try to climb, to gain whatever height they can as if the floor were molten lava. All the wise can do is watch as their friends trample over each other, regretting their final decision.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You cowards,&quot; Romin shouts. It&apos;s dark, but I can see him weep. &quot;You have no honor. You have no courage! If you die, you will be remembered! You will live forever in the hearts of our people.&quot; But he&apos;s the only one standing that far beyond the walls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Open the bloody damn gates,&quot; I command. The others hesitate, so I do it myself, just enough that the scrambling cadets can roll through. &quot;Several at a time, or you all will die.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We can only save twenty before the great cancer Endogeny is too close. My hand trembles on the lever, and I curse Romin for his idiocy in leveraging such a terrible situation on me. When do I lower it? There are still so many that struggle. They&apos;re like rats desperate to escape a flooded drain tunnel. If I don&apos;t lower it now, the rest of us will all die for nothing.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Lower the gates already, it&apos;s going to kill us!&quot; Jarrett shouts, but I&apos;m stuck in indecision.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The stranded cadets screech with bloodcurdling cries. I close my eyes, unable to watch the horror as I throw the lever. I hear the cracking of bones. I can hear their screams drown out as the spiked edge of the massive gate lowers on them, while the ones still alive cry, reaching through the bars, resorting back to climbing as they curse me, condemning with the last of their souls as they&apos;re marked for death.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Tears crest my eyes, and I fall to my knees. The hate grows stronger, and I want to die here. I couldn&apos;t save them, not all of them. I wish so strongly that the ground could swallow me whole. I anticipate a death so painful that it could repay just a fraction of those lives I&apos;ve sacrificed, wishing I was among them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then I feel her embrace. Sylvia hugs me. Though her warmth can&apos;t penetrate the depth of my loathing, all I can do is rest there, deprived of the desire to rise from the frostbitten ground, and she raises me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The cadets I saved join her. They stand around me. Hands rest on my shoulders. They thank me for what I&apos;ve done. They pledge their lives to the fight to survive, but even over their voices I can&apos;t refuse to hear the chaos of the soon-to-be-dead; the cacophony of confliction, and so I bury myself further in the dirt.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Let me die here,&quot; I plead.

        "<p>&emsp;They said the iron gates dissolved in a matter of minutes. I refused to turn my head and watch ever since that moment I closed my eyes and bowed my head. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I feel so weak. Weak and afraid. Afraid and unworthy to play the executioner in a world of sheer brutality. A single spasm of muscle and I ended the lives of two dozen cadets, condemning to the fate of death before Endogeny could consume them, and I wish I were among them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I refuse to move while the cadets I saved fight for me. That confidence was all a lie: we know nothing of this horrifying amalgamation, and just like Romin, I am nothing but a coward, unwilling to fight, detached from the drive to live for myself.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My sins will never be forgiven. Every time I close my eyes I&apos;m met with the face of my dying father, and I remember our final argument. Gods &mdash; I was such a child. And Ellie&apos;s cry, pleading for me to save her when I was powerless and weak, as weak as I am now &mdash; there was nothing I could do for her. Now the two dozen other fatalities join them; they need no faces for me to place their anguish to the bitter end.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My body tingles with the desire for motion. All it needs is just a spark, and I search for it within me. How terrible am I, to speak words of courage and how badly these Cadets need us, only to cower here and do nothing? If there&apos;s an afterlife, I don&apos;t deserve it. No acts of valor denote the bookends of my story. I can only redeem a fraction of what I&apos;ve taken if I give myself wholly. There will be no peace otherwise.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I draw Valentina&apos;s Vermillion rifle. I loaded it moments before, considering pulling the trigger when Sylvia wasn&apos;t looking, but the thoughts of leaving her in her last moments weeping over the body of a friend who killed himself is too much to bear.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;So I decide I won&apos;t live for myself anymore. I steady the rifle to the sound of battle cries beyond the barracks, and the memory of distant dreams harmonize between my ears, singing that I was born to this world as nothing more than a sacrifice. There need be no spirit when it impedes the soulless machine of battle. The pain of sorrow can no longer hurt me. The pleasures of love pass through me as phantoms of a life I don&apos;t deserve. I&apos;ve always lived just to die for others, and now in the final chapter, I must steel myself in those vows.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My ears ring. All I can hear is the sound of my own heartbeat, and all I can feel is the trembling ground beneath my feet with every explosion. For once my mind is entirely clear, unrestrained by primal fear. Endogeny pours through the melted gates like molten magma rock, a conscious mass of blackened innards, bone, and tendons, splitting and merging in an orchestrated cacophony. Explosions rip chunks that launch skyward, leaving craters that mend in seconds. The front lines keep dragging backwards, driving us up the hill. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The mass is conscious and horrifying. It contains the memories of all the lives it&apos;s taken. When it splits into humanoid projections, armed with obsidian swords composed of the hardest parts of its victims, it seems as if each cadet can discern the faces, and I soon learn that hesitation is its strength.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;So many figures withdraw from Endogeny like hail from a storm cloud. They grow legs when they need to go faster; additional arms when engaged in swordsmanship. My hands are steady when I draw the rifle, finger posed on the trigger at the perfect angle. I pull when the sights line on a blackened torso. They crumble like wax idols, dissolving into the dirt, waiting to be remerged with its greater form, too small to be capable of motion. I pull the bolt back and chamber another round, just as the front lines are pushed a hundred feet from the stone walls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The great mass shapes all its victims in flesh before the living, a master weaver of sinew and bone; a sculptor with skill as divine as the Chymaeran Gods. It reaches within to the memory of every victim to project the images of everyone that cadet has ever loved.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I watch Isla&apos;s hands tremble as Delvin and Vera appear before her. Flushed in false color like glazed tar pottery, I&apos;m surprised when these projections try to resist, but no matter what, Endogeny collapses them to reform again, endless as the waves against the shore of Blackwater&apos;s lakes.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t hesitate! Hesitation is death,&quot; I shout, but I cannot hear the sound of my own voice, and I&apos;m sure not many listen either. The lines draw closer. I know these are my final moments. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I want to die away from my friends, somewhere they won&apos;t find me, to an enemy that leaves its victims with no recognition.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Pull back! Pull back,&quot; the Cadets shout, but I don&apos;t listen. Our faith tells us of the Reservoir of Souls, where the dead reconvene before being reborn into a new life. You can only be freed when you entirely release the attachments of your past life, and I pray if I succumb in a final act of valor that I might be found worthy to see the ones I love again.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I want to come home to my mother. I want to feel the warmth of her embrace again. I want to cry and tell her how hard this life has been, how sorry I am that I was too weak to protect her daughter. I want to apologize to my father. I want us to be a family again, wherever that future world takes us, no matter how long we might wait there in the Reservoir, how many words and tears it might take to settle the woes of this endless nightmare.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And I feel my grasp loosen on the rifle, the last piece of a cherished friend who waits for me on the other side. I can feel her spirit in every stroke of the bolt, the jarring crash of the debris that killed her in every blast. The concept of death horrifies me, no matter how much I galvanize myself against the values of life, and I hate that feeling. I hate the self-preservation that draws the breath when I hold it as long as I can. Will it be painless? Did poor Delvin feel nothing when it took his legs and he was beyond the point of no return?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Endogeny has focused on me. I&apos;ve disappeared from Sylvia, Isla, and Jarrett in the scrum of two hundred cadets, the closest on the front lines, and I know now is the time to give in. I can pray that I&apos;ll see them on the other side: there&apos;s no chance for anyone.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Endogeny erects three masses, drawing a ten-foot circle around my feet, closing me in. It chisels them in convulsions of muscle and sinew, drawing the memories of my beloved that succumbed to its influence.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Their guise adapts from memory. Endogeny searches the neurons of minds that recall me for emotion of the strongest memories. One rises with the cloak of a city guard, strong with muscle. A mess of black sharpens into a prickled beard. The figure is unfinished, but not by accident; the arm crumbles off as if it were a statue mistakenly blemished by its creator.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;To the side rises Romin. Further right rises Valentina, their faces just slightly off, enough that it twists my stomach and sends shivers down my spine, as if they were formed by an amateur artist who had only seen them in passing, who knew nothing of proportions.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;They extend their arms to me. We can be free, forever, they speak, without words. I feel my hands loosen further on the rifle. I feel myself drawn towards their embrace, wanting so badly to succumb, to give my life for one last feeling of warmth to send me off. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s a gift to die here, and I feel my breath falter. My heart slows. Endogeny presses another ten feet up the hill, and I&apos;m left far behind in the circle.</p>",
        "&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; I tell them. &quot;I&apos;m sorry I couldn&apos;t save you. I don&apos;t deserve this mercy.&quot; The circle draws closer as they approach. The rifle falls from my hands, and just when I think I&apos;m going to lose myself entirely, color begins to flush in the shadowed face of my father."

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Panic is the last thing we need. All we need is to calmly respond,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;Isla, you have thin wrists. Reach for the keys&mdash;&quot; but he&apos;s interrupted by Romin&apos;s voice outside.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s time now, cadets!&quot; he says. He stands atop a makeshift stage of fruit crates. &quot;Now is the time where we fight. The enemy waits at the gates. We must meet them before they destroy us!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What is he talking about? Is he talking about going out there?&quot; Sylvia says, as Isla reaches for the keys. She shifts herself. She&apos;s so close.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s suicide,&quot; Jarrett says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;All he wants is to be a martyr. All he wants is glory,&quot; I say, &quot;and he&apos;s about to take a hundred cadets unless we stop him.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin beckons with his rallying cry. The cadets respond with nervous cheers, adrenaline eclipsing their fears of death, if only for a moment. They want so badly to be led, to feel a part of something, even if it means until the bitter end, but I refuse to let that happen.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I can&apos;t reach it,&quot; Isla says. &quot;It&apos;s too far.&quot; And then I see a stick just beyond the ground-level window.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Use this,&quot; I tell her. I toss it through the bars, and she grabs for it. She reaches for the key ring, trying to hook it. The rest hold their breath. I watch my friend rally a hundred cadets in martyrdom.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Step forward if you&apos;re courageous. Step back if you&apos;re a coward. This means almost certain death, but you&apos;ll be sacrificing for the betterment of our people, the key tenant of our Academy,&quot; he says. Several step forward. Isla&apos;s arms atrophy.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My words can do nothing behind these bars. My heart drops when cadets open the gates. The crowd is divided in two groups of trembling firebrands, about one-to-four, and Romin stirs their emotions further.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Ah!&quot; Isla exclaims. The keys are in her hands. She fumbles her fingers against the lock and it opens.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You first. You&apos;re the only one that can stop him,&quot; she tells me. The door clicks, and she throws the iron grate aside. I hear Romin&apos;s cry drown out as it grows further. Endogeny is approaching, and it will spare no one &mdash; not even these cadets with tombstone courage.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I break the top of the stairs, heaving, clearing great distance as quickly as my legs will allow me. They&apos;re passing under. The final split is nearly half and half. Hundreds of cadets are going to die just so Romin can feel his last moment of glory. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Stop! Stop, all of you! This isn&apos;t courage or glory. We fight with our minds, not just our hearts!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Only several of them stop, the ones that just broke the line of the gates. I watch their eyes. They see something unspeakable approaching, and then their natural instinct of self-preservation finally kicks in.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Lower the gates!&quot; one cries.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No, wait!&quot; the others beyond the walls scream. But it&apos;s too late. The heavy metal gates are already down. Several of them try to climb, to gain whatever height they can as if the floor were molten lava. All the wise can do is watch as their friends trample over each other, regretting their final decision.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You cowards,&quot; Romin shouts. It&apos;s dark, but I can see him weep. &quot;You have no honor. You have no courage! If you die, you will be remembered! You will live forever in the hearts of our people.&quot; But he&apos;s the only one standing that far beyond the walls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Open the bloody damn gates,&quot; I command. The others hesitate, so I do it myself, just enough that the scrambling cadets can roll through. &quot;Several at a time, or you all will die.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We can only save twenty before the great cancer Endogeny is too close. My hand trembles on the lever, and I curse Romin for his idiocy in leveraging such a terrible situation on me. When do I lower it? There are still so many that struggle. They&apos;re like rats desperate to escape a flooded drain tunnel. If I don&apos;t lower it now, the rest of us will all die for nothing.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Lower the gates already, it&apos;s going to kill us!&quot; Jarrett shouts, but I&apos;m stuck in indecision.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The stranded cadets screech with bloodcurdling cries. I close my eyes, unable to watch the horror as I throw the lever. I hear the cracking of bones. I can hear their screams drown out as the spiked edge of the massive gate lowers on them, while the ones still alive cry, reaching through the bars, resorting back to climbing as they curse me, condemning with the last of their souls as they&apos;re marked for death.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Tears crest my eyes, and I fall to my knees. The hate grows stronger, and I want to die here. I couldn&apos;t save them, not all of them. I wish so strongly that the ground could swallow me whole. I anticipate a death so painful that it could repay just a fraction of those lives I&apos;ve sacrificed, wishing I was among them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then I feel her embrace. Sylvia hugs me. Though her warmth can&apos;t penetrate the depth of my loathing, all I can do is rest there, deprived of the desire to rise from the frostbitten ground, and she raises me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The cadets I saved join her. They stand around me. Hands rest on my shoulders. They thank me for what I&apos;ve done. They pledge their lives to the fight to survive, but even over their voices I can&apos;t refuse to hear the chaos of the soon-to-be-dead; the cacophony of confliction, and so I bury myself further in the dirt.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Let me die here,&quot; I plead. But they drag me, away from the lever, away from the walls where twelve cadets&apos; bodies are separated in half, some of their upper halves still crawling as they hold tightly to life, some resigned to their fate, others holding to the top of the gates as they kick lower firebrands off.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The last I see is Romin, standing atop a crate like a statue: absolute; galvanized in the strength of his conviction; unyielding though no eyes watch him. He doesn&apos;t hear the screams of the ones he&apos;s stranded. He doesn&apos;t watch them crawl, their arms grow bashed and bloody from thrashing against the iron lattice.</p>",
        "&quot;Remember me,&quot; I hear him say, but nobody watches. He dies a statue with no etchings, without a name to remember. I close my eyes before the bile drowns his life and his legacy."

    [
        "<p>&emsp;They said the iron gates dissolved in a matter of minutes. I refused to turn my head and watch ever since that moment I closed my eyes and bowed my head. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I feel so weak. Weak and afraid. Afraid and unworthy to play the executioner in a world of sheer brutality. A single spasm of muscle and I ended the lives of two dozen cadets, condemning to the fate of death before Endogeny could consume them, and I wish I were among them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I refuse to move while the cadets I saved fight for me. That confidence was all a lie: we know nothing of this horrifying amalgamation, and just like Romin, I am nothing but a coward, unwilling to fight, detached from the drive to live for myself.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My sins will never be forgiven. Every time I close my eyes I&apos;m met with the face of my dying father, and I remember our final argument. Gods &mdash; I was such a child. And Ellie&apos;s cry, pleading for me to save her when I was powerless and weak, as weak as I am now &mdash; there was nothing I could do for her. Now the two dozen other fatalities join them; they need no faces for me to place their anguish to the bitter end.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My body tingles with the desire for motion. All it needs is just a spark, and I search for it within me. How terrible am I, to speak words of courage and how badly these Cadets need us, only to cower here and do nothing? If there&apos;s an afterlife, I don&apos;t deserve it. No acts of valor denote the bookends of my story. I can only redeem a fraction of what I&apos;ve taken if I give myself wholly. There will be no peace otherwise.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I draw Valentina&apos;s Vermillion rifle. I loaded it moments before, considering pulling the trigger when Sylvia wasn&apos;t looking, but the thoughts of leaving her in her last moments weeping over the body of a friend who killed himself is too much to bear.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;So I decide I won&apos;t live for myself anymore. I steady the rifle to the sound of battle cries beyond the barracks, and the memory of distant dreams harmonize between my ears, singing that I was born to this world as nothing more than a sacrifice. There need be no spirit when it impedes the soulless machine of battle. The pain of sorrow can no longer hurt me. The pleasures of love pass through me as phantoms of a life I don&apos;t deserve. I&apos;ve always lived just to die for others, and now in the final chapter, I must steel myself in those vows.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My ears ring. All I can hear is the sound of my own heartbeat, and all I can feel is the trembling ground beneath my feet with every explosion. For once my mind is entirely clear, unrestrained by primal fear. Endogeny pours through the melted gates like molten magma rock, a conscious mass of blackened innards, bone, and tendons, splitting and merging in an orchestrated cacophony. Explosions rip chunks that launch skyward, leaving craters that mend in seconds. The front lines keep dragging backwards, driving us up the hill. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The mass is conscious and horrifying. It contains the memories of all the lives it&apos;s taken. When it splits into humanoid projections, armed with obsidian swords composed of the hardest parts of its victims, it seems as if each cadet can discern the faces, and I soon learn that hesitation is its strength.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;So many figures withdraw from Endogeny like hail from a storm cloud. They grow legs when they need to go faster; additional arms when engaged in swordsmanship. My hands are steady when I draw the rifle, finger posed on the trigger at the perfect angle. I pull when the sights line on a blackened torso. They crumble like wax idols, dissolving into the dirt, waiting to be remerged with its greater form, too small to be capable of motion. I pull the bolt back and chamber another round, just as the front lines are pushed a hundred feet from the stone walls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The great mass shapes all its victims in flesh before the living, a master weaver of sinew and bone; a sculptor with skill as divine as the Chymaeran Gods. It reaches within to the memory of every victim to project the images of everyone that cadet has ever loved.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I watch Isla&apos;s hands tremble as Delvin and Vera appear before her. Flushed in false color like glazed tar pottery, I&apos;m surprised when these projections try to resist, but no matter what, Endogeny collapses them to reform again, endless as the waves against the shore of Blackwater&apos;s lakes.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t hesitate! Hesitation is death,&quot; I shout, but I cannot hear the sound of my own voice, and I&apos;m sure not many listen either. The lines draw closer. I know these are my final moments. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I want to die away from my friends, somewhere they won&apos;t find me, to an enemy that leaves its victims with no recognition.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Pull back! Pull back,&quot; the Cadets shout, but I don&apos;t listen. Our faith tells us of the Reservoir of Souls, where the dead reconvene before being reborn into a new life. You can only be freed when you entirely release the attachments of your past life, and I pray if I succumb in a final act of valor that I might be found worthy to see the ones I love again.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I want to come home to my mother. I want to feel the warmth of her embrace again. I want to cry and tell her how hard this life has been, how sorry I am that I was too weak to protect her daughter. I want to apologize to my father. I want us to be a family again, wherever that future world takes us, no matter how long we might wait there in the Reservoir, how many words and tears it might take to settle the woes of this endless nightmare.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And I feel my grasp loosen on the rifle, the last piece of a cherished friend who waits for me on the other side. I can feel her spirit in every stroke of the bolt, the jarring crash of the debris that killed her in every blast. The concept of death horrifies me, no matter how much I galvanize myself against the values of life, and I hate that feeling. I hate the self-preservation that draws the breath when I hold it as long as I can. Will it be painless? Did poor Delvin feel nothing when it took his legs and he was beyond the point of no return?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Endogeny has focused on me. I&apos;ve disappeared from Sylvia, Isla, and Jarrett in the scrum of two hundred cadets, the closest on the front lines, and I know now is the time to give in. I can pray that I&apos;ll see them on the other side: there&apos;s no chance for anyone.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Endogeny erects three masses, drawing a ten-foot circle around my feet, closing me in. It chisels them in convulsions of muscle and sinew, drawing the memories of my beloved that succumbed to its influence.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Their guise adapts from memory. Endogeny searches the neurons of minds that recall me for emotion of the strongest memories. One rises with the cloak of a city guard, strong with muscle. A mess of black sharpens into a prickled beard. The figure is unfinished, but not by accident; the arm crumbles off as if it were a statue mistakenly blemished by its creator.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;To the side rises Romin. Further right rises Valentina, their faces just slightly off, enough that it twists my stomach and sends shivers down my spine, as if they were formed by an amateur artist who had only seen them in passing, who knew nothing of proportions.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;They extend their arms to me. We can be free, forever, they speak, without words. I feel my hands loosen further on the rifle. I feel myself drawn towards their embrace, wanting so badly to succumb, to give my life for one last feeling of warmth to send me off. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s a gift to die here, and I feel my breath falter. My heart slows. Endogeny presses another ten feet up the hill, and I&apos;m left far behind in the circle.</p>",
        "&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; I tell them. &quot;I&apos;m sorry I couldn&apos;t save you. I don&apos;t deserve this mercy.&quot; The circle draws closer as they approach. The rifle falls from my hands, and just when I think I&apos;m going to lose myself entirely, color begins to flush in the shadowed face of my father."
    ],
    [
        "<p>&emsp;The circle halts. Endogeny freezes around me. I can see a tension in its mass, some force resilient against the command to consume. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The form of my father resists. The colors grow sharper. The cloak saturates, and his arm grows from bone. He twinges, as if the conscious anguish metastasizes in a physical struggle for command of his form.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You deserve . . . everything . . . of the world I couldn&apos;t give you,&quot; he mutters, as his true colors flush entirely, and he detaches from Endogeny. His skin is smooth, no longer worn with age. An iron sword carved from memories of his time as a guard is tensioned in his hand, and the gift of a locket I gave him as a child holds around his neck.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He&apos;s no older than I am. He looks around twenty. Cords of finely-honed muscle brazen his arms, and the past design of the Dragon Class mark pours from his shoulders.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t die an early death and live the rest of it in regret. Don&apos;t make the same mistake as me,&quot; he pleads. &quot;In death I will protect you the way I never did. I hope it &mdash; amounts &mdash; to anything,&quot; he says, slashing at the forms of Romin and Valentina, decapitating them. They fall back to the uphill river of black tar.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The creatures turn to me. I&apos;m a hundred feet inside the bounds of Endogeny. They take the faces of any victim I&apos;ve ever seen: the postman that greeted me every day at the door. All my beloved Academy instructors. Valentina and Romin. Even the face of my mother &mdash; and so I realize it ravaged the graveyards for flesh as fuel, too.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But the postmortem specter of my father braces. I can feel the immense pain he takes to keep this form apart from Endogeny, and I know it won&apos;t hold forever. I watch him raise his hand as the tar river slims in front of me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I reach for the rifle only to find it has already been taken. He extends his new arm to clasp my hand. In the firmness of my grasp, it molds to take the form of the sword he bought me when I began my training at the Academy almost fifteen years ago, the sword I threw out in anger when our arguments boiled over into rage, when I began to hate him so much that I stopped visiting him for leisure.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Bone and sinew contract to form the appearance of carbon steel. The weapon is brutal and resilient, literally forged of love and memory, far stronger and sharper than any weapon I&apos;ve ever used.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The projection of my father and I stand together. Our movements play in an immaculate last dance of slashes. The sword I hold floats with the lightness of my family&apos;s love. The sound of every slice graces with rekindled memories of my mother&apos;s voice. When it connects with the black wax of dark dopplegangers, it slices through with the sharpness of my father&apos;s lessons, the strength he taught me before sadness divided us. Every step is another memory, and as a blade dancer, I can feel an entire life flash before my eyes.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I watch the colors of my young father fade. His strength over the conscious mass weakens as I re-approach the edge of the tar, so close to breaking through, although the creatures mutate faster. The last memory of Clint and I reduce the masses to their earthly graves &mdash; just enough impedance before they reform ahead of us, and we&apos;re slicing at them all over again.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But that detachment still holds within me. In the beauty of this last moment, I can&apos;t think of it as anything more than a last fruitless effort. The line of freedom is still so far away, and what is it for? Just for another hour alive to succumb later. I can see Sylvia slashing from the other end, out of arrows, reduced to a scavenged sword, and she cries out for me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I still can&apos;t feel any reason to live for myself. The love of others is beautiful, but not persuasive enough. I can feel the exhaustion flood my muscles. I know I cannot keep this up forever. Ninety percent of the cadets have been extinguished. The remaining are stranded atop the perimeter walls, their high ground a stranded island surrounded by seas of liquid charcoal.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I see Isla&apos;s face appear among the tar-bound doubles, and a piece of my soul fractures when I sever her neck, slicing like butter with no hardness of a spine. I&apos;ve lost her. And when Jarrett joins Romin, I feel the spirit of my resistance dissolve.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My hands are frail and weak. Endogeny gains strength as my father fades. Sylvia is still so far away, and I hope I can apologize to her in another life. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m not strong enough for this battle.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The will to live for myself is too weak.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;So my slashes grow sloppy, my dodges slow like moving through molasses, and obsidian blades begin to slice my skin.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that I fall to the ocean of tar, to become another face that haunts the living.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My father stands over me, reminding me of the times we practiced in the back yard of the house with training equipment. So many rounds after the passing of my mother he would stand over me in resentment, feeling pleasure in letting me saturate in that pain, as if I could feel the hurt of loss for him. But here his body covers me, no color left to distinguish him.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry I couldn&apos;t save you,&quot; Clint says, before his mouth seals over with the tar, robbing him of any further words. He dissolves back to nothingness as I feel Endogeny overtake me, the heaviness like water torture with a weighted blanket, and I try to force my last thoughts to be of the life after this one.</p>",
        "I catch a final image of Sylvia standing over me before my face is overtaken. With no breath, mouth, or nose to shout, I watch as it overtakes her. The viscosity collapses her alongside me, and we lay there, entombed in Endogeny just as Valentina laid once beneath the wreckage."

The humanoid faces cover the floor, walls, and ceiling.

Its thick, shelled armor is an extension of its body: the edges contoured with gold, and its triangle of eyes glows beneath the surface of the thick shell covering its face. &quot;I am Endogeny, demigod of the Chymaera: called back to this world by a Mask of the Gods, to act on the only purpose for which I was created.&quot;</p>",

This life was miserable: grinding hard for success at the Academy just for it all to be thrown away. For what? I hated this life!&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What parents abandon their child beyond the walls? How would you not freeze in seconds? There is nothing that lives out there. You know that, yet you refuse to accept it. I can only assume that piece of myself I sent protected you until the time was right.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then where else do I come from? Why would Everett lie?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You were reborn from the soil of that shallow grave. You were kept alive by our deal, threaded to a piece of me. Your promise was to fix Mother Khiras&apos; mistake in exchange for a second wind. Did you really forget it all? Did my divinity not forestall the effects of rebirth?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s your failure,&quot; I tell her. &quot;It&apos;s your fault that I forgot all of that. I lived as full a life as I could. But my friends are dead; my family is dead; my sister is missing; the entire city and all that remains of humanity is reduced to a rotting mass of flesh. I lost everything! Gods above . . . or here, or wherever they are, have you even seen the suffering it&apos;s taken to get here?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just a daughter of the races&apos; Gods. I cannot see all the affairs of mortals like they can. I simply exist until I&apos;m called to take their place.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And this purpose made you send me to suffer?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No. That purpose was mother Khiras&apos;s ignorance. She preyed upon another guilt-ridden Mask of the Gods with the same offer. Rebirth is a cleansing process that purges the vitriol of past lives, but mother Khiras used him for her own purpose, allowing his to persist, letting him cycle over and over until the perfect end pleased both of them. But that perfect end never came.&quot;</p>",

You pleaded me for it: you even pleaded to go with me, persuading me to escape the ennui of a meaningless infinity as a Goddess&apos; child. You told me how much I would suffer in mortal flesh, how much it hurt when you passed on. But you promised me it was worth it; how much you loved your father and mother; your sister; the entire experience of life no matter how much it hurt you and left you for dead. So who do I speak to now? Do you lie just like all the other mortals that came before you, brokering deals with the divine for a life to squander?&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;In the conscious collective mind of Endogeny, there&apos;s a part of me still there, a part of my blood. It refuses the connection like oil and water, but in those places it connects, I feel the consciousness of a million humans.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can feel memories, all their last moments of horror, attachments of what it feels like to love and hate. I can feel the nameless essence of who they all were, as our memories have all been joined together. My connection is weak but I still search for her, so many faces like the young girl I raised, though none are Ellie. A part of me feels relief that she&apos;s free of this place, hoping that she&apos;s still alive somewhere, and I pray she finds the strength to live on.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My brain sends signals to my arms and legs, and I&apos;m surprised when I still feel them there. The only sensation that holds me to this world is a hand still clasped in mine, and I feel the incredible strength of her Essence, coupled with a part of myself that&apos;s unpalatable to Endogeny.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s as if I can feel divinity flood my circuits. I recall dreams of holy blood. And for the first time in my life, I feel the true strength of my Essence in physical form, resisting the black bile and refusing to merge. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Endogeny gives me a vision as it tries to overtake me. I&apos;m trapped chest-deep in a black tar of gnashing faces that have no lungs to scream. The humanoid faces cover the floor, walls, and ceiling. I try to resist by pushing myself out with my arms, only to find that the scar on my wrist is tethered with a glowing, crimson thread, attached somewhere beyond the layers of black bile above me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I use the thread to free myself, climbing it like the ropes at the Academy fitness course though the bile impedes my motion. I&apos;m nearly free when I hear the resonance of something that almost sounds electric.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Something angular and unnatural protrudes from the amalgamation of flesh: large, obsidian, and planar with sharp, slender limbs.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So many millions I&apos;ve brought to this unity. But you still resist.&quot; Its voice crackles through that same electric resonance like changing radio frequencies. Its thick, shelled armor is an extension of its body: the edges contoured with gold, and its triangle of eyes glows beneath the surface of the thick shell covering its face. &quot;I am Endogeny, demigod of the Chymaera: called back to this world by a Mask of the Gods, to act on the only purpose for which I was created.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;A Mask?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Mask. The divine conduit between the will of the Gods and the impermanent life of the Humans, the righteous conductor holding a fraction of their power. Have you truly never heard of this?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It stabs its slender arm into one of the faces, withdrawing what might be thoughts or memories. &quot;Look at that. Not a single human in this age knows the truth. Are you all just ignorant?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Why are the Chymaera attacking Blackwater?&quot; I ask, still trying to free myself as Endogeny watches. &quot;What does this frozen wasteland have that you could ever possibly value? Is it the powers of the Afterlife?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I have no knowledge of what demand compels me. I am only a force of nature. Yet, for the first time, I have a master of mixed heritage &mdash; with only half the blood of Chymaeran divinity.&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The demigod approaches.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The other half is just like yours. Human.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It reaches to try and sever the thread with a swipe of one of its arms, but it only pulls me out further. The thread refuses to give. Something else does first, and so Endogeny cries in anguish. Part of its arm is missing, and as it wills it to grow back from the conscious bile, it cries out.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What is this? All these Essence-less cattle, yet you&apos;re nothing like them. A connection to the Gods,&quot; it says. &quot;You have no business here. Get out!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The scrum of eyeless faces condense as Endogeny disappears into the walls. It feels as if I&apos;m being digested: the bitter smell of death and rot as these amalgamated fleshy intestines try to digest me like a swallowed coin. But the thread tensions. I feel myself withdrawn from this viscous grave like an ingrown hair torn from flesh. Layers upon layers of arms and legs and faces of living muck pass me, and when I break the surface, I sprawl atop a large mound of dark, ashen clay, surrounded by an infinite crystalline plane of obsidian.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;An uncountable crowd of silhouettes stumble across the crystalline desert: lost souls waiting to be reborn. Somewhere far in the distance is the only non-reflective surface, just like in all the prophetic tales of life after death: the void of rebirth.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I try to run for it, but I find this thread is attached somewhere far above me. My feet leave the mound of conscious clay and I swing forwards before returning to the point from whence I tried to escape, only to find a second thread extending down somewhere else.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My ethereal form indents in the muck. Next to me is a young girl dressed in immaculate, white clothes, holding on to the other end of the thread. She lifts her wrist. My thread extends upwards to infinity, but so does hers. I can only imply ours are tethered together.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;A million souls held for ransom, incapable of being reborn until the moment they&apos;re all released,&quot; she says. &quot;That&apos;s the power of Endogeny.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This is not the world I remember. This must all be a vision. I look around. The sky is missing, replaced with planar surfaces of obsidian at an infinite distance, as if I float from within a hollow geode lit by the faintest purple light. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This is the Reservoir,&quot; I say. &quot;The true afterlife.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes. But your time has not come yet. And if your stubbornness persists the same way as the one that came before you &mdash; all you will ever be is a visitor.&quot;</p>",

There&apos;s no biting cold to freeze craters of mud as unsealed coffins for mass burial, but a peaceful warmth, and when I open my eyes to try and lift myself from the softness of this place I&apos;ve been carried, there is only gold and white.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My muscles ache with atrophy. It feels like a training day, as if I&apos;m flooded with the soreness of a full-body Academy workout, and when I try to lift my legs from the blanket wrapping me in a warm embrace, something heavy resists my right leg.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I let a small groan escape the grimace tensioned in my lips: flexing everything to mitigate the pain, I&apos;m unable to pull myself from this barricade of sheets. I test every muscle in my body. The pin-and-needle response of tingling means it&apos;s there, and I try to pulse the blood back through my veins, waking the whole rest of my body to catch up with my conscious mind.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Gone . . . all gone,&quot; I say, and I want to cry so badly, but I&apos;m so parched of water that my body refuses to waste any of it. I can only cry through whatever lonely words my lungs will offer to the empty, humid air; pleading for death as if that little girl still listens at the other end of the thread. I put the last of my energy into any muscle that will heed my call. I drag myself to the side of the bed, and once I pass the threshold of soft comfort, I slide off the edge, crashing to the floor.</p>",

I find the very premise of my value to the divine acolytes of the Afterlife to be too absurd to believe, let alone the fact that one of their own would be assigned to oversee my recovery. But when the stranger withdraws the hood that brought them to lightless slumber, I find she is not a stranger after all, but the last person that entombed herself in Endogeny along with me.</p>",

Her dark hair brushes my bare chest as she bends down to lift me in her arms, and I feel so humiliated and weak. She deposits me on the bed so she can bury her head in my chest, too broken yet to form a sentence, and I let her cry for the both of us, tracing my trembling fingers through her hair since my body has no warmth to offer her. </p>",

I just thought you&apos;d be ecstatic about this opportunity.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;I feel the wetness from her eyes seep into the covers. I brush her hair to the side the same way I did when we were alone together in that terrible place, and it slowly calms her. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My voice cracks when I muster the words from my dry mouth. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;As long as I last, I&apos;ll be here,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She pauses for a moment, and just like every time before, a part of me fears those three words will rise from either of us. We&apos;ve spent our lives saying everything but as if it were some dangerous incantation, even though our connection is so far beyond them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;So I say a different three.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll be here,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll be here for you too,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;ll consider it. Probably end up taking the same oath, but I need time,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>",
        "Several minutes pass before her breaths return to a calm rhythm and she lifts herself from my chest. She gathers her things together, mentioning that she has the first responsibilities of her service to attend to today, leaving me with a few sweet words before she breaks the threshold of the door. It&apos;s only moments after Sylvia departs that the Grandmaster Ullrich surprises me with his presence: not only to extend the offer, but to surprise me by asking for something else."

You might be the reason they saved us from the Chymaera.&quot;</p>",

I&apos;ve had lifetimes to practice,&quot; he says. &quot;The Essence of the Afterlife has kept me alive for more than a hundred years, and before that, I explored this world as a Mask of the Gods. As the firstborn child to the king of Northaven, I was betrayed and cast aside by my own family. But I still had the divine birthright.

And if you have to pay with blood, you will fight a glorious and honest battle. Being forced to try again and again is what saved me. Death was no longer an option, like you think it is for you.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Where is everyone? Is the Afterlife always this empty?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course not,&quot; one of the three escorts says. The light hurts my eyes when I break the threshold of the infirmary&apos;s doors, and I shield them with my pallid wrist. The uniform I wear is unbecoming of the weakness I exude: the perfectly-woven obsidian threads in cacophony with my tangle of messy hair and unkempt beard; my white flesh contrasting the color of a population that spends much of their time basking in the radiant light, even if their hands aren&apos;t calloused and dirty like the ones that toil below.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then where are they?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He gestures toward the shining center of the city.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It takes a moment for my eyes to accommodate the vast distance. For so long I&apos;ve only looked at close things: faces, impressive infirmary meals, whatever scant literature I could find whenever the exhaustive toil of my body and the Essence treatments made my mind prioritize slumber. The furthest I see is the edge of this landscape. The entire city of the Afterlife looks like a porcelain chalice filled with white foam and wild berry mead, between the radiant azure roofs and polished marble walls, embellished with eaves of lustrous gold. The streets that wrap between the buildings are lined with raw granite, so perfectly flat as if nature intended it, reminiscent of the snow and ice these citizens only experience from a vast distance. And in the center, so many miles away where all the moisture of the basin congregates, is an island of glistening land where the tallest buildings rival the height of the outer rim.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s quite a walk,&quot; I say, and I&apos;m taken aback when one of my escorts takes offense.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Is that some kind of joke? You think people like us would waste our time on foot?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No, not at all,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;There. There&apos;s our ride. The Grandmaster sent for a touring car to take us there,&quot; he says. &quot;And that other guest is joining us, too.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The low hum of an engine crescendoes as a vehicle approaches. I can count on my hands how many times I&apos;ve had the privilege to ride in one of these cars: each time at the conclusion of a school year when Valentina&apos;s chauffeurs ferry us from the Academy to lavish parties at her estate: in the early years to protect us from danger, and in the later years to protect us from ourselves, preventing a dangerous, lonely, moonlit trek with half a handle of liquor. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s so lovely to see you up and about,&quot; Sylvia says. Driven from a barracks far more exorbitant than Merlot blood could ever dream of, she&apos;s taken the time to look her best. She leans against my shoulder as the motor hums to life once more, and I feel an odd and uncomfortably unrequited sense of stillness.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It takes me a while to figure what&apos;s missing after the automobile departs from the curbside, and I feel that strange sensation of inertia in all directions like riding the swaying gondola from summit to ground. It&apos;s far unlike the train that starts where the gondola leaves off, traveling in a perfectly straight line. What&apos;s missing is how smooth the ride is &mdash; as if we glide across the ground on white rock softer than chalk, or maybe the springs of this great, pearlescent machine are tuned so precisely that any disturbance is ignored.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It only gets warmer the closer we draw to the center, covering miles and miles in such a small span of minutes. They make fun of my captivation at the miracle of motion as if I were some kind of savage, throwing the word &apos;rustblood&apos; like Ullrich, yet I think they&apos;re insane to ever become used to this blessing. And Sylvia joins me in splendor. The silent rush of wind beyond the purr of the motorcar in the spaces when the driver lifts their foot from the accelerator and we descend on gravity alone into the basin; what it sounds like to be far from the eternal clockwork of industry in a land where their worship provides sustenance for all.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The verdant grass loses the lifeless brown. Lush, leafy bushes explode with vibrant flowers, unafraid to show their colors when they&apos;re not fighting for the meager nutrients to survive, and my hand grazes the foliage I can reach on the side of the road. The island approaches as the ground runs flat in the bottom of the basin, reflecting a line of light in the peaks brighter than the golden eaves, boundlessly offered by the unsetting sun.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;For a while, I forget the conditions of my presence here, a tourist of these sights I never imagined beyond Everett&apos;s forbidden books, thinking them a fantasy. It&apos;s just as we slither around a switchback to face the place from whence we came that I notice the strangest sight, rubbing my eyes to try to reconcile the bending light. It&apos;s somewhere east of where we left, just over the rim, but still within the bounds of the Afterlife, distorting the air around it like the affects of a heated grill.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I ask them what it is.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ll learn soon enough,&quot; he says. And quickly adds, &quot;when you&apos;ve been here for long enough, of course.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The air condenses several degrees when we cross the bridge to the great island embellished with the finest buildings, looking so new though they hold that venerable beauty that only the most masterful craftsmen of history could ever create. I consider they must be the centers of worship where the selfless sacrifice of their time allows the Gods to provide sustenance for all, designed for the pleasure of a celestial eye that looks for reassurance of our eternal exaltation.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that I see the populace walking towards the central spires. What they wear is nothing like the vantablack threads of the Royal Guard: immaculately white in a way that boasts of how pristine and unadulterated their lives are, only colored by the precious jewelry and patterned colors, and for a while I feel that I should bow before them, undeserving of their slightest attention. Not a single one looks a day over middle age, their faces only creased by laugh lines that make it impossible to imagine a moment of sorrow, yet it feels as if each has lived for a hundred peaceful years.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We pull up a couple hundred yards away from the central building I can only assume is either a political center, a house of holy worship, or both, with a square perimeter path of red stones spanning at least a quarter mile square. I can&apos;t resist imagining how many of the destitute families below could thrive in such an unused, well-manicured space, but I have to focus on the words I carry from the experience below: one of such pain that these smiling worshippers couldn&apos;t fathom to imagine. The azure spires cast peaks of shadow that stab into the grass, obscuring the sun, yet the central hall has so many windows etched into all sides of the marble that rectangles of magnified orange radiate the dewy fronds. The grass is so soft beneath my feet as we cut across the great yard with all the other finely-dressed acolytes raising the excitement of their peers. My entourage surrounds me closely as if I were either a guest of honor or a prisoner. Sylvia gets her space. And when I enter the main hall, I hear raucous shouts that sound like celebration, wondering if this is truly the event that Ullrich described to me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Unlike the flimsy stands of the Academy&apos;s auditorium where I gave my speech, there are sofas of box seats shaped in &quot;U&quot; formations that face towards the stage in the center, each grouping with an overstocked personal bar. But it&apos;s not just drinks. The succulent smell of the most delicious cuts of meat assault my senses, and I realize I&apos;ve never felt so hungry in my life. There is laughter, clanging golden chalices, and more red wine than all the blood shed by their lower subjects. I hear the voice of Ullrich in the speakers as I descend the stairs, omnipresent like the celestial beings that must have had a hand in sculpting this haven. There are so many people here. The closer I draw to the front, the more claustrophobic the crowding becomes, though the circle of guards part through the masses like a hot knife. They hardly give me any attention: despite how Ullrich dressed me, I only receive looks of disgust and contempt.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Ullrich eyes me between words in his speech. They celebrate the survival of Blackwater, still alive after the massive Chymaeran offensive. There are cheers, laughter, and as many drunken-red faces as that of Vermillion Boulevard after exam week.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The next Golden Age approaches in only moments, after so many endless years we&apos;ve waited. The enemy of true-blooded Humans will finally pay their price. We will return!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And at that, another great cheer echoes through the hall. Gold bracelets clatter. Crystal chalices raise with wine I imagine is older than Nordhaven. We set our chairs briefly in one of the boxes. Sylvia settles at the table, taking a long drink of wine. And when I approach the stage, I take my first full look out at the crowd. Candles adorn every table, and despite their high spirits, I consider this is still a vigil for the unwitting victims below&mdash;whom to these people must be far out of sight and mind. But Ullrich&apos;s speech reassures me that, deep down, we all share the same common enemy.</p>",
        "I approach the stage as Ullrich introduces me. &quot;And for your entertainment, we have a special guest tonight: one of the lone survivors of Blackwater, the Valedictorian of the Northern Province, district fourteen, Titus Berguard!&quot;"

This time I speak not of future dreams and visions of success and camaraderie: those visions are the afterimage of a beautiful dream our lower people dreamt before the horrors of Endogeny.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Chymaera will pay for what they did.

        "<p>&emsp;The words leave my lips by their own volition. My emotions crescendo with the weight of my words. This is nothing like that soulless graduation speech. This time I speak not of future dreams and visions of success and camaraderie: those visions are the afterimage of a beautiful dream our lower people dreamt before the horrors of Endogeny. Wrapped in my words, I don&apos;t notice the expressions of the crowd. I&apos;m trying to stay afloat, on the edge of drowning in all the anxiety and sorrow, closing to this podium like a branch that will save my life.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Chymaera will pay for what they did.

        "<p>&emsp;So little I remembered of the trip to the dungeon: only two similarities and a difference. First, it was the same escorts surrounding me just as closely as they did before, without the pleasantries of a word. Second, it was the same car that took me there, leading me to an understanding that this was the plan the whole time.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The only difference is the feeling of betrayal I could never imagine: to have my understandings of this people transition from lauded selflessness to utter disgust; to have all those formative years in Seminary I learned songs of admiration and worship to mean absolutely nothing; only certain of the presence of divinity by that inexplicable column of crimson light in my dead father&apos;s shop that precipitated all of this.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We drew closer and closer to that anomalous mirage of bending light on the horizon, just over the rim, and when we finally made it to the precipice, I saw the endless stretch of warehouses, segregated by rail lines fanning like capillaries from a vein of something critical being distributed around the city. Nearest to the northeast near Province Nine, I could see that one of them leads to a depot where I can only imagine a lift carries those resources down.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Darkness consumed the open-topped touring car after we descended between the span of warehouses. It&apos;s a wide tunnel with two rail lines on either side. I felt a nausea crescendo the closer we drew to the light at the end, as if my body was being compressed and stretched against its own matter though it holds the same volume. The guards held their noses, ducked their heads, and closed their eyes as if they felt it a thousand times before. But with my eyes wide open, the shrinking world behind us took on a distinct shade of blue as if  our eyes were adjusting from candlelight, though this long tunnel is darker than sin. There was no fire to precipitate the sensation of heat, or the glowing motes passing us that shift from blood red to yellow to white to cerulean to deep indigo, giving off no ambient light. Ahead, the grand skylit chamber looked as if it were set ablaze, redder than the sky when Everett&apos;s trade house burned with the children inside, minus the ash and smoke. The colors saturated stronger with acceleration, the sensation of all my matter being pulled from the front and back and squeezed on every side, until finally we came to a stop at the threshold of a vast chamber, bathed once more in pure white light from wide openings above.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Now they escort me from the automobile, depriving me of all my possessions. Parting with my mother&apos;s necklace means so little now that there is no one else left to remember her. They strip me of the fine-woven uniform, giving me the only sullied linen outfit I&apos;m convinced exists in this puritan bubble &mdash; that is, until I pass the room filled with thousands of the same, lightly tinged with dried blood that couldn&apos;t have been cleansed in the meager seconds each of these were cleaned.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The cloth feels older than humanity itself. When my fingertips graze the tears in the fabric, I realize they&apos;re not the frayed, soft contours of holes made from wear, but from something sharp that sliced the threads and the meat behind it. A residue of fine particulate garnishes my fingers, and I find it&apos;s from the fabric itself: so old that the smallest fragments of the fiber lack the strength to adhere together, and if I dressed any more aggressively, the outfit might have turned to dust.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I think it is glass that accents the entire outside of this dome, so great it might be able to cover the entire Academy of Province Twelve, but it&apos;s something else. No way that glass could ever be curved so precisely absent the scratches, over such a vast surface, and when I look closer, it looks like a shaded membrane of some gas that doesn&apos;t like being crushed. Maybe that entire experience in the tunnel spans only a couple feet up there: unsurvivable by even the celestials, and when I hear something crash to the ground in front of me, I find the only other sign of life at my feet. It&apos;s a cardinal: flushed with vibrant feathers on its right side as if it died only seconds ago. The midsection is bare, stripped to rotting meat as if the decay of weeks had taken hold of it. And on the left, there is nothing left but the bones that once held the structure of the wings.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Keep moving,&quot; my entourage beckons: the first words they&apos;ve said since they dragged me from the hall. We march through another tunnel lit in patterned rectangles of light from above, and I come to understand that there are three of these monolithic chambers in a triangle joined by the halls. Something divinely powerful and older than the rocks of this planet rumbles below. It sounds like voices, like entire conversations spoken in seconds, the sound of tools of both violence and labor. Though I can&apos;t see past the threshold of the overlook, I know it&apos;s there to afford light to whatever survives beneath, probably spanning deeper than the height of the frostbitten ground at the foothills of this vast mountain.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We descend a set of stone stairs, and the light is ever-so-slightly saturated in blues and reds once again. I hold my nose and close my eyes or else I might vomit, led by the guards and my grasp of the guardrail until there&apos;s no more steps etched in the stone. The cells were recently vacated: I can tell from the sight of half-consumed produce and meat without the yellowed decay or smell of rot, and it&apos;s when I hear the shouting that I realize I&apos;m being led to the other two unfortunate prisoners.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This is all your fault! I told you over and over that the debt we amassed for being out there &mdash; for holding to that pathetic, imaginary sense of self-congratulatory purpose &mdash; would come due. That it would result in this if we didn&apos;t try. The collapse of everything. And all we did was fucking watch!&quot; The young woman says</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;They don&apos;t even notice at first when the steel-barred door hinges open, creaking on centuries of rust, and I&apos;m ushered into the cell. The massive dark-skinned man dressed in aged robes of the Carmine bows his head as he crumples in the corner. The carved stone is dark in splotches beneath his head, and I realize that he must be crying. He wipes his gray beard of the mucus that collected there, still refusing to deposit it on his robes though he&apos;s been stripped of all his honor.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And we call ourselves the First Red? The ones that staked our whole lives on planning a return, on liberating our own flesh and blood that were raised to die? The ones that are already dead? Those vaults in all the compounds are still full: full of all the implements we needed to at least fucking try, Raine!&quot; She shouts. When she withdraws the hood of her own Carmine fabrics, her back turned to me, I recognize this anger is only half of her raw display of emotion. Behind the dark-brown braid that spans from behind her head to the front of her right shoulder, she weeps harder than the man called Raine squatting in the corner.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Raine&apos;s voice is deep and remorseful. &quot;I understand, Lyra. I understand your grief, and I&apos;m aware . . . of our failure . . . &quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Trapped in the very chambers their weakest young are sent to toil, to train . . . kids no older than I look that come out beyond recognition, if they ever leave. And can you believe this place was once a blessing? A Divine Wish by a Chosen Mask to afford a boundless source of sustenance with meager sacrifice of every living person? Bastardized for war and imbalance?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m hesitant to speak so I just stand there. All that&apos;s left is to bide time before whatever fate approaches, and I&apos;ve resigned myself to it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The girl called Lyra slumps in the other corner. Her hazel, bloodshot eyes briefly meet mine before settling on the floor, letting seconds pass before she offers so much as a word. &quot;And what makes you so important to them?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No idea. I was good at the Academy. That&apos;s about all I ever was.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I ramble on with recent events. My voice is better background noise than the rumble of whatever churns beneath us, and with my aching body devoid of any peace to bring me to sleep, I spill everything to try to find the slightest sliver of catharsis.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And so I lost everything. My father. My sister. My fireteam. And now the person most special to me. She couldn&apos;t even watch when I stood up for myself,&quot; I tell them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Family was a sacrifice for all of us. We&apos;ll be joining them in the Reservoir soon enough,&quot; Raine says. &quot;I gave up my family to act as a liaison for the Carmine of my Province. I thought it was for the better. To prepare. To return and save our own race, but we became so&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Complacent. Pathetic. Self-gratifying over an unkept promise, tugging yourselves off to your own glory,&quot; Lyra says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I know that,&quot; Raine says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Your own family,&quot; I ask, &quot;are they dead?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I have no way to know. All I know is that my children think their mother and I am. It had to be airtight. When the last elder passed and the opportunity arose, I was next in line, and it had to be unquestionable, no paperwork or trail leading back, or else the Afterlife would smite us.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra adds, &quot;And all that was&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, Lyra,&quot; Raine says. &quot;It was all for nothing in the end.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Water drips somewhere beyond the cell. The faintest light from the grand central dome reaches the walls by the stairwell, merely a reflection of a reflection of sunlight in the dark hollow, the only evidence of a world beyond this space.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And what of you?&quot; I ask Lyra.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve been running of the fumes of a stupid hope that once filled me with purpose,&quot; she says. &quot;My father betrayed our own people. My mother died early. And my older brother put himself in danger to save me.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;He gave his life. There&apos;s no denying it,&quot; Raine says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I still refuse to believe that,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;His grave was empty. Before I ever left the Afterlife to join the mission of the First Red, I visited that place beyond the walls again and again, but one day it was empty.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But that means nothing,&quot; Raine says, savoring a sense of revenge for the poison of her past words. They both rise to their feet. &quot;A shallow grave? Maybe his limbs were picked apart by hungry, desperate wolves with the claws to dig. Maybe Snowdrifters exhumed his body for any precious accessories they could steal.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s not a chance!&quot; Lyra says. She drives her fist against him with all the intention of a powerful blow, but his chest is no different in hardness than the three stone walls surrounding us. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra crumples. It was all the strength she had.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I know he&apos;s out there. Or he was. I just know my father was hiding something, that Everett was hiding something, that it would be impossible for a child of cross-raced, pure-blooded strength of royalty to be allowed to die so fruitlessly. That column of crimson light was proof of it!&quot; she says. &quot;He was going to be the next Mask of the Gods. Now all we have is this impostor . . .&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The curiosity of the name outweighs my helplessness, so I stop her rambling. &quot;Everett?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;My uncle. The pathetic weakling that forced my brother&apos;s hand. The one that locked us out of the only safe place we could separate ourselves from those marauders guising as Snowdrifters.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;My grandfather was once called Everett,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Not a surprise to be named after one of the royal children of Nordhaven,&quot; she says. &quot;My Everett was the original. And my father was his older brother: the one that leads this holocaust. You know him as the Grandmaster.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What? So Ullrich is your father?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;He disowned me when I stood up for the very people he once swore to protect,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;When he returned to the scene of bloodshed and my dying brother, something changed inside of him forever. It was almost too quick a change to believe, as if he were weathered by a thousand lifetimes in a few seconds. And, by the Gods how he loathed Everett: that lonely, pathetic coward insisting he was protecting what those intruders came for, more valuable than either of our lives. I&apos;m glad he had no children to carry the weakness of his blood. And I&apos;m glad he spent the rest of his life regretting that choice...&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Well. My Everett had a son that he ignored, and his offspring did the same to me,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Good for you,&quot; she mutters. A couple seconds of dripping water pass the time before she opens her mouth again. &quot;I&apos;m sorry. I didn&apos;t mean that. It&apos;s just &mdash; none of this really matters anymore. There&apos;s nothing left to fight for: nothing left to save. All that&apos;s left is to watch that other cross-blooded monster take the birthright of my brother. Maybe father made another one since I didn&apos;t have the right blood for it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And why is this &apos;mask&apos; so damn important, worth massacring for?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, what would you do to harness the power of the Gods, if it meant fixing something that was taken from you? There&apos;s no going back for him. Not to the innocent child he buried over his negligence. Not to the daughter he disowned because his grief was stronger than his love. Not to when Nordhaven  fell to the Chymaera a hundred and fifty years ago when he was a young man, when his own people escaped to the north, extinguished of all their Essence, rendered powerless from the loss of generations of Essence accumulation. Maybe he thinks he can get even with fate, maybe he&apos;s convinced himself that he&apos;s earned it,&quot; she rambles.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Is he going to get it?&quot; I ask.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;All I have to measure time is the seven trips to the latrine afforded by the guards: little more than a pit dug deep into the earth, rancid with the waste of an uncountable number of people before me. The food is enough: rather than divine praise bringing bushels of produce from the sky or however the lower peoples imagined it, it came from the very ground, and this place is unquestionably the everflowing source of it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It feels so much longer than the day that Ullrich proclaimed. I find sleep when it&apos;s forced out of me. That reflection of a reflection of sunlight on the far stairwell wall turns dark only once. There&apos;s little conversation between the three of us, since the only commonality is that we&apos;re trapped together. Occasionally we&apos;ll sleep with our backs to each other, or all sprawled against the bare wall with heads on shoulders: our flesh the only softness that exists in the cell beyond the thin fabrics we wear. But by the time our detention expires, it all feels like it was only a matter of hours.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The sound of footsteps builds in the stairwell, along with the sound of voices: going up, not down. Neither of us can catch a glance at any of them: at least a dozen, ushered by a single tall figure with silken blonde hair.  They wear the same threads I wore for the celebration, yet they&apos;re not polished enough in their speech or cadence to be seasoned guards. I almost think I recognize a couple of their voices. Then I just consider it&apos;s a panicked mind longing for connection with anyone I&apos;ve seen before.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It must be time,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Time for us to go. To pay for the sin of valuing our fellow man over progress,&quot; Raine says. &quot;The only sin I bring to this death is being too late to try to save them.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then the freezing gale engulfs the cell. It brings me back to the night I lost my father, when the sister I cherished was ripped from his arms, when my blood was so cold that I couldn&apos;t urge my muscles to move. I shiver in the fear and grief. The others tremble, but not from the cold: itching their skin, panicked at something else that seems more horrifying than any imaginations of death could ever conjure.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Raine, do you feel that?&quot; Lyra says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The hardy Raine&apos;s voice trembles. &quot;The power. Not by generations or by nature, but by something far, far worse . . .&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My body freezes like it did when I confronted the Chymaerans for the first time. My hands refuse to hinge. Even the thoughtless beat of my heart slows to a painful slosh of clotting blood, and when the obsidian-clad, tall, flaxen-haired woman passes the threshold of the leftmost wall, her amethyst eyes pierce deeper than the blade that killed my father.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Spiderwebs of purple spread across our flesh like an allergic reaction to wind. It brings me straight back to Everett in the final years of his life when he lost his mind to the Chymaeran Curse, and part of me thinks it will end this way, before I remember it&apos;s not climactic enough for Ullrich.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You will follow me,&quot; she beckons. &quot;Your body won&apos;t give you a choice.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She unlocks the door, and we follow her up the stairs. The resistance of any muscle undedicated to putting one foot in front of the other causes a strain like growing pains. And it&apos;s when we make it to the top of the stairs that I see all the others that lived far beneath the ground.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus? Is that you?&quot; A voice says. It comes from a face I can&apos;t reconcile: just a little too old to be a colleague from the academy. Or is it?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s really him. The Valedictorian.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Of what class?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The last one.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But I never saw him in the trials.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;He was the top of the class! Of course his fireteam wouldn&apos;t have suffered through that. They were special enough to serve.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Why don&apos;t you give us another rousing speech?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I open my mouth to reply. All I manage is a squeak before the obsidian pain reclaims my wasted energy towards walking to the touring car at the mouth of the tunnel, and I find my head turn forwards and down toward my feet.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The last trip passes in pain and resignation, while the other two passed in astonishment and betrayal. I find humor that I can brag I&apos;ve taken more car rides than I can count on my fingers now, but there&apos;s no one left to listen. All the acolytes are gathered once more for the final event before the transition of some prophesied golden age, and it seems we&apos;ve been reduced to just another entertaining sideshow. They&apos;d be throwing quartz and pouring their expensive liquor on us if it weren&apos;t for the fine craftsmanship of this automobile. Across from me, the blonde champion stares into my eyes while I refuse her glare, the only thing left I can resist. And before long, they usher us to the front of a makeshift pit unearthed in the park outside of the grand central hall, surrounded by watchers that ravenously feed off every ounce of our desperation.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The hate we witness is unfathomable. The three of us, redressed in tattered rags of worse quality than the furthest outwallers, are cajoled with all the ruthless anger and hatred of the weakness that brought our race to its knees, forcing us to seek refuge north of Nordhaven in Blackwater. We&apos;re free game for the clods of dirt and pebbles when we&apos;re far enough away from the automobile, still forced to walk by that deathly, otherworldly force. Eventually we fall to our knees in front of the pit, our backs turned to the pulsating remnants of Endogeny, its putrid smell of unsettled flesh wholly overridden by the sweet smell of honey mead and venison. It takes all the will we have to prevent gravity and the weakness of the curse from pulling us into the pit.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s finally now that I can see the leaders of this regime, seated directly in front of us. I don&apos;t recognize any of them, though I&apos;m sure none of their cattle would ever be important enough to know.   What do pigs and cows know of their masters beyond the hand and sickle? What use is a name when overwhelming power makes the boldest pronouncement? My heart races with that innate, animalistic sense of adrenaline that begs me to survive at any cost although my mind has resigned itself to this inevitable end.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The nameless king beckons for Ullrich to end the campaign he began so long ago. Ullrich and his vassal for the power of the Gods assemble directly before us, and behind, the unrecognizable cadets in obsidian fatigues flank the pit.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I hear the king speak for the first time. Like any leader worth their weight in needless gold, he tells a story they&apos;ve heard a hundred times before that gets far more hyperbolic and exciting with every telling. &quot;A hundred and fifty years have passed since the fall of Nordhaven. Our capital city was the shining beacon for the future of Humans. But the coalition of forces led by the Chymaeran separatists nearly extinguished our people. Most of you probably remember running for your lives. You are the ones whose strength allowed them to hold on to the Essence of generations. The weak were mostly extinguished, drained of their Essence by our enemies: few of them following our retreat like moths to flame, clambering north through the snow with their meager Essence, keeping the fortunate warm enough to survive the trek alone, leaving more frosthards than powerless swine.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Their weakness damned us!&quot; One of the adherents shouts.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So we overtook Blackwater. In a hundred years we expanded it from a fledgling city of a hundred thousand into a new capital that forgot everything of its past. We shaped the filth and brine into a system that would work for us. Instead of the mild climate wasted on all the peasants across the land, we consolidated such power that the jungles of the Verdalans and Ahkvasans could grow atop a barren summit three miles high. And we forced the pigs below to produce the power and smoke that would keep them warm. We filled the troughs through the labor of their own people. Gave them all the conditions to fornicate and produce as many bodies they could to slowly trickle with the generational crescendo of Essence. And now, at the end of our long winter, and at the threshold of our long-awaited return, we herald a new Mask, a new vassal to carry our forces to Blackwater and everywhere beyond!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The king steps down from his portable throne to re-introduce the new ruler of their armies and his leading general. He introduces the cadets behind us as &apos;rustbloods that have proved their ruthlessness enough to die for our causes.&apos; I watch as Lyra and Raine tremble to the left and right of me, light of the curse as their champion waits to extinguish us at the most enjoyable time.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I hear my name somewhere between the cheers. I twist my head as left as it can muster: it&apos;s Sylvia, awash with that eternal look of fear and weakness that has followed her since our earliest years together in the orphanage. She is powerless as ever, just a spectator to the death of a man that once protected her, that might have even said that he loved her, but in all my affection for her, I can&apos;t find a shred of anger.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I still feel the snag of attachment, like a thread, bonding me to this world, and the more I see it, the more furious I become. It&apos;s the feeling of something more than duty. For the entirety of this life I could accept that the world was just unfair, that I deserved nothing and got whatever came to me, whether good or bad. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But instead of the stillness I thought would come with fulfillment of duty, it&apos;s a pain of loneliness and fear.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I regret. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And those words of emotion terrify me before I can withhold them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This entire life has all been a waste. And then the longing overtakes me. That despite the anger and fear, how badly I wish to be safe in the warmth of her embrace, rather than feeling the heat leave my body and fall into the now vacant pit behind me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;How I should have listened. How I should have opened the door to my father. How I should have spent more time with Ellie. Gods! How could I have been so selfish to keep her? How could I ever be good enough for her, to render her life an eternal nightmare because I didn&apos;t have the strength to let go!</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I muster a smile at Sylvia as Ullrich makes his presence, hoping just this once that actions can speak for the words that, despite everything, I had yet to tell her. And one last time, I can forgive her as she vanishes into the crowd, never to be seen again.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Ullrich says, &quot;It took the royalty everything to convince me to join their effort. I was opposed at first. But it was the loss of my own child . . . the loss of my two children, rather, that showed me the true importance of this crusade. They taught me the definition of sacrifice&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Fucking rat bastard,&quot; Lyra manages. &quot;Even killing your child is all about you, huh?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;and as I stand here faced with the face of my daughter, I can tell you that this is a reminder of the strength it takes for us to let go of that past. To forgive the weak for their sins. And to give them a quick and painless death so that the ones that matter can forge on. Besides the weak-blooded daughter, I once had a son that would carry the pride of our blood. But now, I have a true daughter,&quot; he says, placing his hands upon the shoulders of the Mask. &quot;And now, for the first time in a century and a half, we will make our triumphant return!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I hear Lyra unleash a bloodcurdling scream when the Mask is distracted: just enough strength in her body to do one last thing.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She manages little more than a couple steps before the Mask casts spiderwebs of amethyst upon her. Ullrich extends his hand to grab her throat and lifts her in the air.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You can stop that,&quot; he tells the Mask. &quot;This is something I have to handle on my own.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No, Lyra!&quot; Raine manages. And so the Mask focuses all Lyra&apos;s suffering on him, causing him to tremble hard enough that he begins to slide down the muddy pit.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can only watch as he suspends Lyra over the pit while she&apos;s at full strength. It takes Raine all the resilience he has to draw the effort into his powerful muscles to propel himself to his feet. With his arms outstretched, he tackles Ullrich into the pit along with his daughter.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m coming, Fletcher.&quot; The name of her brother is the last words that crest Lyra&apos;s lips.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The onlookers are mortified. Only the king and queen, and all the rest of the royalty, remain in their seats unaffected by the turn of events. And when I hear the sudden turn of the spectators, as if this were some Academy wrestling match in the fields, Ullrich ascends from Endogeny entirely intact.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The strong will always prevail. The weak will always be left behind,&quot; he says, as he returns to his place in front of me, dropping whatever&apos;s left of their skulls upon the ground. &quot;And it is the Essence in our circuits that divides us.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He calls to the Mask, handing something to her from within his pocket, and I recognize it as soon as she places it around her neck. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The first cross-blooded Mask of the Gods to come to this world. Raised on the blood and sacrifice of the rustbloods,&quot; Ullrich says, raising the necklace to show a single shimmering fragment. &quot;Between the divine blood of the Chymaera and the Humans, she will be known as the Heiress of Purgatory!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Despite my vision, I instantly recognize it, glowing red as it approaches her: the piece of Pure Essence in the amulet I found beyond the walls. And on the fumes of a dying mind, I realize what I had been missing the whole time.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Merlot never stole it. The Carmine never kept it. It was the Afterlife that took the pure-Essenced Amulet to use it as a catalyst for this godless metamorphosis.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It is time to withdraw the great weapon Endogeny. It has served its purpose,&quot; he says, and as the Mask closes her eyes to meditate on the celestial power, I can only watch as it dissolves, assimilated wholly with her circuits.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that a radiant heat bathes the outer lands in cleansing light. Particles of crimson Essence lift from millions of dead, disintegrating Humans, floating in the air like paper lanterns at light against the eternal dawn. The liquidous void surrounding their island capital saturates with motes of amber, rising as bubbles from something dissolving far below, higher than the steeples and spires of the central hall. And like an infinite blanket of stars, they glow on the light of a state a lifetime past. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I have no tears left to weep at the disregard of their sacrifice. I&apos;ve sweated out every last fluid in my body, and I hold on to the meager moments I have before I press on to the veil of the Reservoir. The motes gravitate towards the undeserving acolytes of this godless regime, and they stretch their hands like joyful children, absorbing whatever stolen sparks they can as their flux consolidates on the Mask, saturating her with unspeakable power. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But their triumphant elation ends as soon as the Essence hangs in the air, like a room of dust in bright sunlight. There&apos;s something else that drains the electricity from the air, and when the motes begin to flow away from the Heiress, past my body to a space behind me, they begin to panic. </p>",
        "It&apos;s only when the process reverses that their screams pierce the air, casting them to the ground, actively losing something precious to them for the first time in their effortless lives. Because their long-separated Gods had forsaken them, they tried to create their own. They thought they could create an Afterlife greater than the Gods. And now I finally get my catharsis when the Essence peels from their circuits. "

But now, I have a true daughter,&quot; he says, placing his hands upon the shoulders of the Mask. &quot;And now, for the first time in a century and a half, we will make our triumphant return!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I hear Lyra unleash a bloodcurdling scream when the Mask is distracted: just enough strength in her body to do one last thing.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She manages little more than a couple steps before the Mask casts spiderwebs of amethyst upon her. Ullrich extends his hand to grab her throat and lifts her in the air.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You can stop that,&quot; he tells the Mask. &quot;This is something I have to handle on my own.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No, Lyra!&quot; Raine manages. And so the Mask focuses all Lyra&apos;s suffering on him, causing him to tremble hard enough that he begins to slide down the muddy pit.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can only watch as he suspends Lyra over the pit while she&apos;s at full strength. It takes Raine all the resilience he has to draw the effort into his powerful muscles to propel himself to his feet. With his arms outstretched, he tackles Ullrich into the pit along with his daughter.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m coming, Fletcher.&quot; The name of her brother is the last words that crest Lyra&apos;s lips.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The onlookers are mortified. Only the king and queen, and all the rest of the royalty, remain in their seats unaffected by the turn of events. And when I hear the sudden turn of the spectators, as if this were some Academy wrestling match in the fields, Ullrich ascends from Endogeny entirely intact.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The strong will always prevail. The weak will always be left behind,&quot; he says, as he returns to his place in front of me, dropping whatever&apos;s left of their skulls upon the ground. &quot;And it is the Essence in our circuits that divides us.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He calls to the Mask, handing something to her from within his pocket, and I recognize it as soon as she places it around her neck. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The first cross-blooded Mask of the Gods to come to this world. Raised on the blood and sacrifice of the rustbloods,&quot; Ullrich says, raising the necklace to show a single shimmering fragment. &quot;Between the divine blood of the Chymaera and the Humans, she will be known as the Heiress of Purgatory!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Despite my vision, I instantly recognize it, glowing red as it approaches her: the piece of Pure Essence in the amulet I found beyond the walls. And on the fumes of a dying mind, I realize what I had been missing the whole time.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Merlot never stole it. The Carmine never kept it. It was the Afterlife that took the pure-Essenced Amulet to use it as a catalyst for this godless metamorphosis.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It is time to withdraw the great weapon Endogeny. It has served its purpose,&quot; he says, and as the Mask closes her eyes to meditate on the celestial power, I can only watch as it dissolves, assimilated wholly with her circuits.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that a radiant heat bathes the outer lands in cleansing light. Particles of crimson Essence lift from millions of dead, disintegrating Humans, floating in the air like paper lanterns at light against the eternal dawn. The liquidous void surrounding their island capital saturates with motes of amber, rising as bubbles from something dissolving far below, higher than the steeples and spires of the central hall. And like an infinite blanket of stars, they glow on the light of a state a lifetime past. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I have no tears left to weep at the disregard of their sacrifice. I&apos;ve sweated out every last fluid in my body, and I hold on to the meager moments I have before I press on to the veil of the Reservoir. The motes gravitate towards the undeserving acolytes of this godless regime, and they stretch their hands like joyful children, absorbing whatever stolen sparks they can as their flux consolidates on the Mask, saturating her with unspeakable power. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But their triumphant elation ends as soon as the Essence hangs in the air, like a room of dust in bright sunlight. There&apos;s something else that drains the electricity from the air, and when the motes begin to flow away from the Heiress, past my body to a space behind me, they begin to panic. </p>",
        "It&apos;s only when the process reverses that their screams pierce the air, casting them to the ground, actively losing something precious to them for the first time in their effortless lives. Because their long-separated Gods had forsaken them, they tried to create their own. They thought they could create an Afterlife greater than the Gods. And now I finally get my catharsis when the Essence peels from their circuits. "
    ],
    [
        "<p>&emsp;The upper plateau is eviscerated by an ever-widening column of light, and in the unholy matrimony between opposing elements of life and death, not even dust survives. The column pours into a flat, widening reservoir bounded by the dense clouds, and when I look up, I watch its reverse waterfall collect in a shadowed lake, and it&apos;s as if I see the reflection of another world.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The dead Essence attracts to somewhere in the crowd like ferric dust to a magnet, growing in magnitude until it&apos;s unmistakable, and everyone turns to watch. They have no idea of the unholy retribution that awaits them. Ullrich begins to panic. He never could have predicted this: how the tables have turned. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A trail of Essence now feeds my circuits, such an uncomfortable feeling that I fall into the empty pit, my head pointed upwards to try and catch an upside-down glimpse of whatever opponent dares to oppose the will of the Afterlife. All the motes are now condensed to a single stream, inundating one of the observers with unexplainable power. Their eyes resonate with the darkest color of blood as they float above us. Their flesh becomes white-hot fire. And in an instant, the godless bastards of the Afterlife experience powerlessness for the first time in their lives.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This pocket of humanity will pay an unpardonable price for all it has taken!  It is the will of the Gods.&quot; The voice is omnipresent as if whispered in every ear. I can feel the Essence oversaturate the air, stirring around like a cup of tea with so much sugar it refuses to dissolve. But something else dissolves instead. It&apos;s not just their circuits being stripped of Essence now: the flesh of all the denizens of the Afterlife begins to wither. The trail of Essence that once saturated their circuits like the fat in their arteries draws from them, and they face a fate far worse than the true Humans they sentenced to death by Endogeny.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Soon they all lie motionless, atrophied of every last fiber of muscle, rendered as nothing but flesh-covered skeletons cursed with consciousness, forced to lie in their last crumpled state until starvation or thirst might claim them, left motionless by the vengeance of hubris. Even my strength is unparalleled compared to theirs. The corpses lie unblinking but conscious: like plants, a permanent installation of nature no longer privileged with the power of mobility.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The only evidence of life I can see stands just beyond the stage, bathed in blinding luminosity. The inverted puddle of pure Essence now glows brighter than the distant sun can muster, and all that remains is the same texture of grief and sorrow that I harbor over the waste of it all.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Her voice booms like thunder. The blasphemers who thought they could reach beyond the Gods come down to their knees.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Let this be a final lesson, unworthy renegades, those who murder brothers and sisters in thoughtless avarice to taste the power of the Gods: all you will ever find is the emptiness of hollow, agonizing death, no longer welcome to the flesh that makes you Human.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Although they have all committed an atrocity so horrible, it pains the Goddess to watch as they lie there, motionless, pleading to be vanquished. She begins to weep as her tremendous form crests the clouds, and when I try my muscles, I realize my life has been spared. The ground shakes. I feel the stirring of something far beneath the earth as my body is tossed about the ground like sizzling drips of oil on a hot plate. The bodies of the motionless living rise to that shimmering portal. It is the Reservoir: the true afterlife, to show them in their last moments they could never create something greater than the forces of divinity.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My hand reaches for that rapturous, otherworldly portal of shimmering Essence: the true Afterlife. I don&apos;t float like the rest of them, and I plead with tearless eyes. &quot;Let me go. Please, let me go! Let me go home and see them! Please,&quot; I continually plead, but that buoyant force never reaches me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I feel the ground tremble beneath me as Khiras&apos; footsteps shake the ground. She had found the last Human amongst the wreckage. She has found me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I feel the ground beneath me liquefy as I ascend higher than the mountains, higher than the clouds, a whole chunk of the earth held between her hands, ten-ton boulders sifting through her fingers like sand. All I can see is the Goddess&apos; eyes as she watches me, her head eclipsing the moon in shape and light, and it feels as if her radiance casts the entire landscape into eternal lighttime.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m so sorry,&quot; I whimper, &quot;I&apos;m so weak, and powerless, and...&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The glow of Khiras&apos; crimson eyes well to the shape of pity. The tears finally pour from my eyes, this has all been too much to hold, and I just cry there, for Sylvia, for Valentina, for Romin, for Vera, for Viktor and Isla, for all the ones whose lives were extinguished in the campaign.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The goddess&apos; eyes well with magma. Scalding tears pour from her eyes as she sinks to her knees, and I feel a radiant embrace of heat as if it covers me entirely: the Goddess tenderly holding her last living child.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Humanity&apos;s last foothold has been extinguished. The blood of eons has been severed. No longer will there exist a mortal of her image to indulge her with songs of worship.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;All I can see in my mind&apos;s eye are the faces of all the people I&apos;ve ever loved waiting for me now. I try to recall my mother&apos;s face; the shape and warmth of Ellie&apos;s gentle form when I embraced her; the voice of each of my friends.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Her wailing cries shake the ground as she holds the entire island to her chest, and from beneath her, magma launches from deep beneath the crust, consuming the grounds of Blackwater in superheated rock, purging the surface of every last impurity as if to start over and plant me in the soil. But I can tell that even the Goddess has given up.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Hot ashen clouds consume the surface; the shape of everything solidified in soot and stone; the last record of the Humans frozen in time for all eternity; my home reduced to a single timeless frame if it couldn&apos;t live on with the power of life. The clouds approach closer, but she doesn&apos;t raise her hands to save me: I can feel the scorching heat begin to sear my nerves until soon I can&apos;t feel anything at all.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Before my vision melts away, the last sight in my mind&apos;s eye is the crimson glare of the Goddess staring directly at me, before the scalding ash eviscerates the flesh from my body, and I&apos;m tugged by the wrist in a direction beyond space, leaving the irreversible bedlam of this dead reality behind.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;In the next frame of consciousness I lie awake and alive. The hazy ash trades for a textured ceiling I&apos;ve seen too many times to count, and the scalding heat trades for freezing night air.</p>",
        "But the crimson eyes are persistent. They look down on me with concern as I panic, choking on smoke that no longer burns my lungs."

        "<p>&emsp;A hesitant voice raises from behind me; a ghost from a past life. &quot;Gods, Titus. Academy is over, darling, there&apos;s no need to rush anymore.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I find myself afraid to turn around and meet her face, as if I&apos;ll see her in the last form I witnessed her. I&apos;ve seen her gray matter splattered everywhere; the hard parts of her crack; the hot blood that circles in her veins still warm and fresh on my face. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And I might lose my composure if I witness every sense of her at the same time.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I smile, though I refuse to turn around. My voice scares me when it wavers. &quot;It&apos;s just who I am, I guess,&quot; I tell her, with a dry laugh.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Are you alright?&quot; She asks. She places her hand on my back, and I shiver soaked in sweat.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, I&apos;m totally fine. Just exhausted &mdash; didn&apos;t want to miss the last car of the night.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She approaches me on the right side of the railing, trying to catch a glimpse of my face, but I&apos;m not ready to look at her yet. Her long, pearl fingernails dance on the railing. Her hat shadows the light that fades on  sweeping landscapes beneath, forever masking her true identity.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Why won&apos;t you look at me, Tie?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sweaty and gross, standing next to a celebrity,&quot; I say. &quot;What brings you up here? I thought you were going home.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;I just had to visit. You know . . . you, Romin, and I never used these lofts as much as we could have, but that doesn&apos;t mean we didn&apos;t build memories here.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I humor her. &quot;Most of my memories on this car are drunk, hungry, or both &mdash; waiting until we got at the bottom so we could all end up at that Last Car diner together.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She dips her hat. &quot;Oh, certainly. Isla&apos;s apartment block was almost my second home.  I felt like I knew everyone there, and not just because they watched my movies.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s nice having friends like that,&quot; I say. &quot;But it&apos;s also nice having a home. I guess it&apos;s tough when we both don&apos;t really have a definite place to return to.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Huh?&quot; She asks. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The cellar,&quot; I say. My sputtering mind doesn&apos;t catch those last words before I realize I&apos;ve slipped up on details I haven&apos;t been privileged to yet.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean, pray tell? Gods above, did Romin . . .&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I just mean . . . that every home feels more and more temporary as we get closer to service beyond the walls,&quot; I offer.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, sure, but &apos;the cellar?&apos; What did you mean by that?&quot; She asks. We&apos;re almost at the bottom, and I&apos;m already thinking about how I can evade this conversation. All I can do is plead ignorance.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean, &apos;what do I mean?&apos;&quot; She says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m just trying to say I understand.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But how can you possibly understand what I haven&apos;t told you, Titus? Can you read minds? Or did Romin slip up, that bastard?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I fumble for an explanation. I&apos;ve spoken myself to a corner, and as I stutter my words, I reach for one last thing to tell her. If I&apos;ve blown this cover, maybe I can make it useful.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I know. The cellar. Your hat. Just promise me, Valentina, please, that you won&apos;t get on that lift. It&apos;s going to kill everyone.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Now she&apos;s overloaded. And in that confusion, before she can call for me like Sylvia, I hop the railing as we approach the station, when the ground is directly beneath us.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And I&apos;m running again. The burning venom in my throat returns as the air gets colder and my breaths grow shallower, but it proves I&apos;m still alive. Just like Sylvia, she calls after me, pushing passengers aside to try to weasel out of the doors. It&apos;s not long before I escape her sight. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But I run into another problem.</p>",
        "It&apos;s when I turn the first corner that we collide, and the two cloaked figures standing beside her draw their weapons. It&apos;s the woman I met only hours before &mdash; the last soul sprawled beside me in that distant future, muttering her brother&apos;s name as her last words."

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s been years since last time,&quot; I said. &quot;Everett took me in here sometimes when he had to take care of me while he was on the job. Last time I saw the place was when it was a smoldering mess, and that&apos;s tomorrow morning.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Who do you think it was?&quot; Lyra said. The streets were empty, but Lyra made sure, before sneaking around the corner with her shoulder against the storehouse walls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The news reports said it was Merlot. The storehouse is Carmine property now. My father sold it behind my back to try to keep his shop alive.

Then the Afterlife would find out. Then we&apos;d be on the run.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The chains snipped off the lock. I looked around. The streets were still silent. My father still sifted through his papers, running numbers. In the warehouse, I heard the thump and drag of boxes. The kids must have already started.</p>",

We sunk into the cellar: the only access from a dimly-lit stairwell across the room, and the side-access from the storm doors. The reverberations of young voices, laughter, footsteps, and dragging boxes could be heard above.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I kept thinking about the news report. It wasn&apos;t just burnt bodies. There were stab wounds. There was more to this than just coincidentally lighting the place on fire to burn the evidence.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, I should have known,&quot; I said, just as Lyra was sifting through the shelves, &quot;the Carmine kids don&apos;t just die on accident, they&apos;re deliberately attacked!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean, Titus?&quot; she asked.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It means they were killed before they even got down here,&quot; I said.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;We&apos;d have to wait until they arrived. We&apos;d have to save the children first. Or else we&apos;d have to be really quick, scan through the shelves. But everything was so empty in the basement: boxes, papers scattered across the floor, spiderwebs, and trashed piled in the corners, and books on the shelves.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This is an important story, Titus, one I hope you will never forget. Even if the city has long forgotten us, Everett said. I could feel the inkling of a distant memory. Something was familiar about this place: the cross-lattice of the beam architecture, the books on the walls, and it felt as if a memory I had tried to suppress.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My fingers fumbled for something to check. I couldn&apos;t stop thinking of the children above, dragging boxes, probably rambling about what teachers they hated in pre-Academy or complaining about their parents, completely unaware of the gruesomeness that would follow in moments. In the anxiety, I felt myself reach for a crimson tome with a worn spine. I could remember -- or imagine -- Everett turning the pages, reading them to me as a child, and as I removed it from the shelf, I felt the tension of a string release something from behind the wall, followed by a high-pitched squeak behind me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The stone floor was creased in a lattice pattern, almost like a flower: petals surrounding a central column of cement. I felt the rumble of the ground beneath my feet as the pedals descended, exposing a circular stairwell.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra fell backwards down the stairs, barely catching her scream, the fumbling and spilling of all the trinkets in her backpack across the stairs until she finally came to a rest at the bottom.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; I said, &quot;I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t know it was there. I feel like I&apos;ve been here before. That book felt familiar. I think Everett once read it to me when I was . . .&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;No answer.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I rushed down the stairs to find her there, holding her head, glancing into the next room as if entranced by a single light that hung from the ceiling, setting a lone table aglow, scattered with papers. I looked over her shoulder. Essenced lamps ignited automatically, in an instant: an item long outlawed by the city, an ancient item I had only heard of, and I wondered how long this place had remained untouched for.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It wasn&apos;t until I stepped past her that I saw what froze her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What the . . . fuck . . .&quot; Lyra said, pointing to the large glass chamber in the corner, marked with the words FILL LINE, dried crimson caked on the sides of what I could only assume was once filled with blood.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This place felt familiar. The feelings it brought were almost . . . painful. I could hear Everett&apos;s voice still haunting this room with its frighteningly calm intonation:</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s alright, Titus, I&apos;m not going to hurt you. Stop resisting. There was the chair in the corner -- desperate fingernail scratches at the end of the arms carved into the polished oak.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Did you know that the Human body holds one-point-five gallons of blood, Titus?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And the desperate, black scratches swiping away from the feet of the chair on the stone floor.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And a child&apos;s can hold three-quarters. But we&apos;ll need more than that. And we&apos;re almost there.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The wrist restraints were lined with sheepskin for comfort. I remembered my seminary boots had black, rubber soles like dress shoes, the cheapest ones Clint could buy. The first few times, I could remember kicking the floor . . .</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This isn&apos;t about you, or me, Titus. This is about the future of the Humans. This is about protecting us from those bastards up there, and from those Chymaeran psychopaths beyond the walls, this is about our last reach in creating ... something, something that can save us . . .</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I could see his face, decaying with age, the amber in the whites of his eyes matched in his pallid flesh like a walking corpse, the faint glow of amethyst in the veins of his skin, and the incredible arthritic pain he winced at, kept alive by a single mission and a stronger pain that never went away.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;. . . Just like last time, son, you won&apos;t remember any of this. I&apos;ll carry you home. I&apos;ll tell Clint and Moira that you fell asleep on my couch, they won&apos;t expect it. They wouldn&apos;t understand . . .</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I could see the ghastly tension in his eyes from a trauma still fresh in his mind, piercing through me harder each day as his insanity overtook him.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;. . . They would never understand what happened to her, what happened to you . . .</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I saw Lyra inspecting a metal tray with needles. A plastic tube ran all the way from the chair into the vat, and I was amazed at how high the dried blood had reached in the chamber.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And you&apos;ll forget the next time, too. And the time after that . . .</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I saw all the papers scattered across the table, illuminated by a single light. We could no longer hear the children upstairs.

        "<p>&emsp;I found the amethyst crest again on the jar of ashes, holding to the table a page detailed PURGATORY PLAN, but that was all I could make out from the illegible scribbles of a mentally-decaying man. Everett remarked his plans to host the blood of Chymaeran royalty within him though it would literally dissolve his brain to mush in a matter of years: the plan to combine the essence of both Gods and both Chosen in an unholy concoction.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Vera&apos;s finger tore the vellum of the envelope, pulling a letter from within that still held legible scribbles, dated a near decade ago, crumpled in wet splotches of what I could only assume was either snowfall or tears.</p>",

I couldn&apos;t stop thinking of the children above, dragging boxes, probably rambling about what teachers they hated in pre-Academy or complaining about their parents, completely unaware of the gruesomeness that would follow in moments. In the anxiety, I felt myself reach for a crimson tome with a worn spine. I could remember -- or imagine -- Everett turning the pages, reading them to me as a child, and as I removed it from the shelf, I felt the tension of a string release something from behind the wall, followed by a high-pitched squeak behind me.</p>",

The two tables stand at awkward angles, wherever the four equal legs would dance the least on the uneven surface, shimmed with flat rocks jammed between cracks. A rucksack carpet lines the floor with splotches of something I can&apos;t discern in the colored light. A chair with custom arm restraints lined with sheepskin. And a cabinet much like an old-style icebox, it&apos;s doors hinged open, filled with vials of viscous liquid that dried long ago.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Heavy footfalls can be heard above. They&apos;re still talking to each other. That sight of five charred bodies is forever branded in my mind, the sight of hardy Romin weeping at the loss as he trembles in anger, their families distraught and infuriated at the audacity of the false Merlot.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra doesn&apos;t know what this will change. I scour the dimly-lit basement for anything that might aid me. I dress in Lyra&apos;s small Carmine cloak. A surplus of rusted rifles rest in the corner: aged by the broken window above dusting constant dashings of snow on the metal. Even as a prop, I grab it anyway, and swiftly rush up the far stairwell to greet the sight of whatever awaits me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I take a deep breath, then throw open the cellar door to confront the Royal Guard disguised as Merlot, and the five kids whose faces will melt to bone from the heat.</p>",

I couldn&apos;t stop thinking of the children above, dragging boxes, probably rambling about what teachers they hated in pre-Academy or complaining about their parents, completely unaware of the gruesomeness that would follow in moments. In the anxiety, I felt myself reach for a crimson tome with a worn spine. I could remember -- or imagine -- Everett turning the pages, reading them to me as a child, and as I removed it from the shelf, I felt the tension of a string release something from behind the wall, followed by a high-pitched squeak behind me.</p>",

Our focus was blindsided, and just as I was too consumed by the voice of my grandfather in the imagery, Lyra was too surprised by a letter on the table, addressed with her name on it. The papers were marked with furious scribbles, held to the table by a jar of ashes, and I could tell by the difference in script how quickly Everett had lost his mind. The scratchings read with frightening imagery: words of THE ULTIMATE VASSAL, of PROJECT PURGATORY, along with two crests: a crimson one I recognized as the crest of the Humans&apos; Goddess, and the other amethyst, one I could only assume was the Chymaerans&apos;.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;I found the amethyst crest again on the jar of ashes, holding to the table a page detailed PURGATORY PLAN, but that was all I could make out from the illegible scribbles of a mentally-decaying man. Everett remarked his plans to host the blood of Chymaeran royalty within him though it would literally dissolve his brain to mush in a matter of years: the plan to combine the essence of both Gods and both Chosen in an unholy concoction.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m almost certain this bracelet and those earrings were among the stolen items.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Hold on a minute. What is this Everett&apos;s relation to you, then?&quot; She asks, and I realize in the passion of the moment I let another thing slide.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Nothing,&quot; I convince her. &quot;But this is my mother. She disappeared ages ago.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra drops it. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I have something else I found,&quot; she says, &quot;so long as it doesn&apos;t twist your stomach.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I rise to my feet. Those feelings of grief and loss are so far behind me that I&apos;m surprised when I feel nothing.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry about your mother,&quot; she offers. &quot;I didn&apos;t even know mine. I was far too young when it happened, so if it&apos;s any consolation&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d let you mope here a while longer, but you told me there&apos;s little time.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Mope? I ask myself, wondering how she could be so ill-adjusted in human relations: pitying me one second and chastising me the other, but I don&apos;t have time to let it bother me. I&apos;ll leave her as soon as we&apos;re done here anyway.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s that face for? Come look at this, Titus,&quot; she says, grasping my forearm, ushering me through a brief stretch of darkness before we weave between half-empty metal shelves.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;There&apos;s an open space partitioned by the shelves across from the stairwell. The two tables stand at awkward angles, wherever the four equal legs would dance the least on the uneven surface, shimmed with flat rocks jammed between cracks. A rucksack carpet lines the floor with splotches of something I can&apos;t discern in the colored light. A chair with custom arm restraints lined with sheepskin. And a cabinet much like an old-style icebox, it&apos;s doors hinged open, filled with vials of viscous liquid that dried long ago.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you make of this? Was he some sick torturer?&quot; Lyra asks me. I try sitting in the chair, but it&apos;s tight. Child-sized.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She opens one of the corked vials and sniffs inside, gagging. &quot;I know what this is. It&apos;s blood!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I look at the floor in front of the chair: the makeshift rucksack carpet torn in a space where the victim&apos;s feet must have thrashed unwittingly.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Just then, we hear a commotion upstairs beyond the faint laughter and dragging of boxes. A change in the rhythm of words from lighthearted jest to statements of fact, and I can tell someone else has entered.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We let the minutes pass us far too easily.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re here,&quot; I tell Lyra.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We can&apos;t leave now! This information is far more valuable. Something big happened here,&quot; Lyra says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Children are going to die,&quot; I tell Lyra. &quot;And then they&apos;re going to burn this place to the ground!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;These documents have the crest of the First Red,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That doesn&apos;t matter. Innocent Carmine kids&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;A couple of lives versus something that could help our entire cause?&quot; She says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Damn it, Lyra! This isn&apos;t up for debate,&quot; I say, and I leave her, rushing up the stairwell.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Heavy footfalls can be heard above. They&apos;re still talking to each other. That sight of five charred bodies is forever branded in my mind, the sight of hardy Romin weeping at the loss as he trembles in anger, their families distraught and infuriated at the audacity of the false Merlot.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra doesn&apos;t know what this will change. I scour the dimly-lit basement for anything that might aid me. I dress in Lyra&apos;s small Carmine cloak. A surplus of rusted rifles rest in the corner: aged by the broken window above dusting constant dashings of snow on the metal. Even as a prop, I grab it anyway, and swiftly rush up the far stairwell to greet the sight of whatever awaits me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I take a deep breath, then throw open the cellar door to confront the Royal Guard disguised as Merlot, and the five kids whose faces will melt to bone from the heat.</p>",
        "&quot;What&apos;s going on up here?&quot; I say. &quot;Those rats are supposed to be working. What are you highlanders bothering them for?&quot;"

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We were passing through when we noticed the lights were on. We thought it was theft at first, but these kids are out long past curfew!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The kids look more confused than scared now: relieved that a Carmine adult is present.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Curfew? Gods, gentlemen, can&apos;t you see that these kids are indoors? We&apos;re paying them by the hour. The Festival of Departure is soon. Their brothers and sisters are graduating beyond the walls, and you want to take away their chance to buy something nice for them?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s just like the night I watched my father die: the same body language in these impostors with no reason to be here, not expecting any resistance.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I eye the children. &quot;Go in the basement. Quit lollygaging and finish a room for once. You should be done by now!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;They&apos;re not familiar with my face, but they don&apos;t question authority. &quot;Yes, Brother,&quot; they tell me, about to file past before one of the faux-Merlot bastards digs their nails into a child&apos;s shoulder.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re not done here,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;ve had noise complaints from the neighbors, from the fella across the street.&quot; But Clint is so hard-of-hearing from his service, I don&apos;t believe that for a second. &quot;These kids are in trouble. And those damn Carmine shitbloods &mdash; they need to learn their place.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The air&apos;s so thick I could cut it with the knife in my holster. I jumped in to this without planning, but I can feel my anger rise when I imagine the guilt I&apos;d feel in failing them again.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra approaches behind me with a bag slung behind her shoulder, speaking for me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, what are you going to do, you uppity pureblood shits?&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The closest one withdraws her Merlotan sickle-blade.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No, please,&quot; I beg&mdash;but before I can exchange any more pleading words, the curved edge carves through the first cadet&apos;s chest. It arcs upwards before she rips it back and the first victim collapses to the floor, dead before they hit the ground.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Two children rush through the basement door before the Merlot restrain the others. We stand with our backs to that door, while the four impostors withdraw the few tools they brought to ignite the greatest street war in this city&apos;s history.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra melts the door handle with her Essence, fusing the lock: It&apos;s doubtful anything less than a fire axe could bash it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The other kids, Lyra!&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Would you rather save two, or none of them?&quot; She asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The two children are held at sickle-point as hostages, necks inside the twisted arc. &quot;Leave now and live, or else we&apos;ll kill them right in front of you!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We both know you&apos;re not here to protect. You&apos;re going to kill them anyway,&quot; Lyra says. Her plume of fire blasts clean through the first impostor&apos;s head. Charred flesh and bone are all that remain, without the chance to raise their hands and ward the attack. The sickle blade clatters to the ground, and terrified, the young boy runs to us, kicking the serrated edge of the sickle before nearly stumbling to his feet.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra rushes left. I duck to reach for the blade, and when I return to raise my eyes, a sharp cry is silenced by a single slice.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Talia!&quot; The child behind me cries. I imagine them as the sister I failed to protect, and it feels me with enough righteous rage to overcome the overwhelming fear.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Stay behind me. Grab my shirt,&quot; I tell her, as I test the inertia of the blade. Timed explosives eviscerate the walls of the trade building: they should have reached the end of their fuse long after the kids were all skewered. And as the three back walls collapse to smoke and incinerating blazes, the fourth front wall is all that stands.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The first one lunges to disembowel me, but I parry, and when they lose their balance, a large cross-beam crashes to the ground between us, severing a wide split a full story down to the empty basement. I distract myself in looking for the children below, praying for the Gods&apos; hands to guide them in finding the exit. I withdraw as a sickle nearly removes my head, and I jump to the other side, always facing my back to the last survivor that&apos;s crying and cowering in the last remaining corner.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Another broad slice misses me by inches. I catch their blade on the crest of mine, twisting it downwards, and I trace their blade in sparks before the serrated edge stops at the hilt.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I kick them into flaming piles of debris, only to be bodied by another attacker trying to push me into the pit. I jump, and my body is cast back across the gap, bashed into the crumbling bordering wall still spanning across the gorge.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra summons plumes of flame from her hands to distract her adversary&apos;s vision as she reaches for an iron shovel in the corner. I feel a nudge behind me. The child returns the blade to my hand.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Sensing a shadow flicker in flames above me, I roll sideways. The Royal Guard jumping the gap stabs his blade into the wooden floor, expecting to carve me in half, not anticipating this span of flooring would carve off with him instead.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He screams on the way down until another scalding log follows and puts him to permanent rest. The wreckage spans all the way to the cavern, and after untwisting my stomach, I leap to the other side where Lyra fends off the remaining two. This side of the room is no longer safe. I can feel the floorboards give on this island, so without a warning, I drag the child with me to the other side.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The second Royal Guardsmen is just about to land a surprise blow on Lyra when I catch his blade with my open-faced sickle, and I jerk it backwards, flinging it out of his hand. His body follows, bashing me to the ground, my upper back and head suspended directly over the crevasse.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Like all the other sick bastards above, he&apos;d rather make me suffer than let me die an unceremonious death. With his gloves charred off from kicking him into the flaming debris, he tries to dig his thumbs into the sockets of my eyes, but quickly gives up, unable to get the leverage he needs to crush them in my skull. I feel an amethyst anguish ravage my brain instead: his brute force crushing my head as I helplessly thrash over the divide.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But I thank the Carmine they embellish their children with tombstone courage. A loud, hollow thunk resonates the crackling air as this intruder&apos;s eyes roll into his sockets, and he collapses forward, rolling directly off me as the last remaining child stands over me with a shovel.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;For Talia,&quot; the young cadet says. He reaches to try to catch me as I slide from the edge, and reclined backwards, I realize there&apos;s nothing my arms can reach, trying to twist and grasp the edge when inertia longs to drag me to my brimstone demise.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You stupid rat,&quot; a voice exclaims, as I slide off the edge and into the ravine to join my mother. But the hood of Lyra&apos;s Carmine cloak snares on the sharp edge of a cast-iron pipe, suspending me there helplessly beneath the floor like an upright spit-roast.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I hear a short cry before the tearing of flesh and bone. A wetness saturates the cloak, dripping beneath the floorboards and across my soot-stained flesh, blinding my eyes.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I claw at my eyes, too late to see the two figures float past me before being impaled on the metal shelf two stories below: one tall, one short. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The fourth wall finally gives. All that&apos;s left is this peninsula of splintered, charred wood one-and-a-half stories above the basement, reinforced by the thick iron pipes that once led to the washbasin, draining scalding city water on the floorboards. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A hand reaches from above the floor. It&apos;s also the first time I hear the sound of anything beyond this warehouse, all the onlookers gathered there to just stand and watch as Lyra throws a rope.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We need to get out of here,&quot; she says. I lift myself back to the surface, my hands black and red and slit with fresh blood, riding the last wave of adrenaline that staves off all this pain. &quot;Nobody can know we were here. Or else all of this, and I mean everything that happened tonight, will be our fault!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I cough black mucus from my lungs, drawing pained and trembling breaths, most of my clothes charred off. By either an act of the Gods or selfishness, Lyra still has the bag slung over her shoulder. While I chose the last child to defend, she wasted her chance to defend my grandfather&apos;s last secrets.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She coughs as she tensions her grasp around my wrist again. We make off into the woods behind the gaping hole of refuse, just as the real Merlotan guards turn the corner.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I hear a familiar voice behind me. It&apos;s booming and bewildered.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus? Titus, what are you doing here?&quot; Romin cries. &quot;Stop!&quot;</p>",
        "But we&apos;ve already disappeared into the woods. Without a chance to shake off Lyra, our fates are bound now. There is only one place we can go, and together&mdash;just as lighttime flashes in the street lamps."

What kinda weak blood are we raising, Clint once said. If you&apos;re gonna bleed, then bleed it out like a man.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then you better hug real tight,&quot; I say. My adrenaline is fading. I can&apos;t imagine what pain awaits me. A pallid bead leaks from the packet, viscous and dense, hovering over my wound until I lower it there. The searing pain overtook me worse than when it happened, only hours before.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I groan, pressing my clean fingers into the cut, making sure the cream saturates every surface. The flesh parts like a bad haircut, and the simmering pain brings me to my knees. I feel Ellie embrace me harder. It surprises me to remember how strong she had gotten, how much she&apos;s grown up.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Hug, hug, hug!&quot; she exclaims. Tears leak from my eyes. But I&apos;m not crying. It&apos;s as if I&apos;m looking in bright sunlight, or on the verge of a sneeze, and I focus on the tightness of her grasp, huffing for breaths between clenching all my muscles to resist the feeling.

Instead of standing in one place, she playfully spins in circles around my hand as if it were a streamer, ducking under my arm each time, grunting as she tightens it as tight as she possibly can. Despite everything, I feel a humor churn under my breath at how cute she is.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She presses her lips to the bandage. &quot;All better, Tie! Momma said that will heal it faster,&quot; she chimes, with a playful skip in her night clothes as she climbs the arm of the sofa, falling backwards into the cushions.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What did he feel so guilty for?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;For leaving my brother and I to die,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;A long time ago, we lived in a house beyond the walls. When Ullrich was out, we were attacked by Snowdrifters. The only secure room in the house was the office, high enough above the ground to be almost two stories, with a bolted door. Your grandfather hid behind that door,&quot; she says.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The kindest face can mask the illest will,&quot; she says. &quot;At least I&apos;m sure he took that cowardice to his grave.&quot; She motions to the picture. &quot;Please . . . Can I keep that?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I thumb further through records. The only fastened pages are in an envelope labeled TESTS. I thumb quickly through the pages. They look like blood tests.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;I read the lines and lines. The further I flip, the more the words dissolve to unintelligible scribbles, just like the map he left for me. The memory of Everett&apos;s eyes will forever penetrate my soul, the last time I saw him, when I brought this map and he looked back across it, as if there was something he wished to say, something he kept silent.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then the same repeating letter: &quot;F.&quot; I&apos;m flipping back to front now. The cursive becomes more legible.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods, Lyra,&quot; I say, sticking my finger in my mouth as I look down at it. Among the intelligible scribbles of the last sessions, there&apos;s a third name I can barely make out.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That last page you made me bleed on. It has Moira&apos;s name on it,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;How long ago was all of this?&quot; Lyra asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;At the end of his life, scribbling away on the last fumes of his mind? Only three years ago.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;re saying Fletcher was there, maybe five years ago,&quot; Lyra says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A look of relief flushes her face. My lie is true, and I see her almost crease a smile for the first time.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Wow! How did you do that, Leera?&quot; Ellie asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m cooler than your pathetic, liar brother, here, that&apos;s why,&quot; she says. She pulls a bowl from the cupboard, adding a spoon before pouring it in.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Thank you, thank you,&quot; she says, before retreating to the couch in the living room.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My eyes catch on a spot on the living room floor before they return to the stacks of documents. It&apos;s just a blemish of soot shen I knelt to hug Ellie, but remembering that pool of blood my father died in sets me on edge.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It was only hours after this that they came to take her away. Have I sped things up? Have I forestalled that future? Or is it seconds away, bursting through the wide glass window, swarming the building, waiting outside for us to sleep or let down our guard?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus. Titus,&quot; Lyra says. I snap to attention again. Ellie is staring at me. My hand is on my heart, and I&apos;m kneeling on the floor, heaving for air like I&apos;m breathing through a straw. My fingers are cold. My body is frozen. I can&apos;t move my joints, and it only panics me further.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s happening again, Gods, please, don&apos;t take her from me,&quot; I cry.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re fine. You&apos;re having a small panic attack,&quot; Lyra says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I stumble towards Ellie on stiff legs that refuse to hinge. Sparks pop in my vision. I nearly collapse to the floor. My flesh is cold. They&apos;re waiting outside again to take her, to kill me or anyone who tries to resist them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I won&apos;t let you go, I swear to you,&quot; I mumble, as Lyra tries to restrain me. I have to see whether the darkened splotches cover her flesh, if her skin is cold like my father&apos;s when his eyes stopped moving in their sockets and I almost wept over them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She just sits there eating her beans, not a blemish or mark anywhere across her skin.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;See, I told you,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Everything is fine.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I slump to my knees and take deep breaths. After a short while, the control of my hands returns. Ellie keeps eating her beans, smacking her lips, then stands up to wash out the bowl.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll take care of that, Ellie,&quot; I say. I&apos;d prefer her upstairs where she&apos;s safe. &quot;Go up and get ready for bed.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But I wanna stay with your new friend Leera!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Go up and take a bath,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Leera will read to you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Okay!&quot; She exclaims, retreating up the stairs.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It must be nice,&quot; Lyra says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Having panic attacks?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course not. Family. It&apos;s a nice thing to witness.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You should meet my father, then,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Meet mine,&quot; she says. &quot;A high-grade purist asshole.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Who says I haven&apos;t, I think.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What you said earlier. When you said the word &apos;again.&apos; What did you mean?&quot; Lyra asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But before I can answer, a knock sounds on the door.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra withdraws the Merlotan sickle she saved from the ambush. I lift Ellie&apos;s dull kitchen knife from the ground, cautiously stepping forward as a lone figure dances behind the cracked glass.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;We speak in hushed voices, almost to the childhood home where I pray Ellie waits for me. A column of smoke dissolves into the smog somewhere behind us. We&apos;re still covered in the aftermath, blending seamlessly into the night.</p>",

You son of a bitch, you told me he was still alive!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She withdraws her dagger, but I don&apos;t resist her. She just sits there on top of me, ready to drive the steel through my neck or eye socket, but I can feel her hesitation as she trembles there in rage, knowing I know so much that she doesn&apos;t, and so instead she huffs and screams, throwing the blade to the side.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She grabs what remains of the lapel of my coat. My back freezes where the scorched holes of my coat let fresh skin touch snow. &quot;How did you know? How did you know their names, Titus? Just me. Just me and my father, we should be the only people that know his name!&quot;</p>",

I&apos;ll tell you a story,&quot; I say, and in seconds, she returns with a white towel, along with the unopened first aid kit my mother Moira bought many years ago. What kinda weak blood are we raising, Clint once said. If you&apos;re gonna bleed, then bleed it out like a man.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I crack it open with one hand. The excruciating pain returns as my adrenaline fades further. &quot;Rip the pouch of wound cream for me?&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Please. And thank you.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Momma asked me to do this one time when she was leaking red too, and she cut herself,&quot; Ellie says, &quot;so I wanna do it for you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then you better hug real tight,&quot; I say. My adrenaline is fading. I can&apos;t imagine what pain awaits me. A pallid bead leaks from the packet, viscous and dense, hovering over my wound until I lower it there. The searing pain overtook me worse than when it happened, only hours before.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I groan, pressing my clean fingers into the cut, making sure the cream saturates every surface. The flesh parts like a bad haircut, and the simmering pain brings me to my knees. I feel Ellie embrace me harder. It surprises me to remember how strong she had gotten, how much she&apos;s grown up.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Hug, hug, hug!&quot; she exclaims. Tears leak from my eyes. But I&apos;m not crying. It&apos;s as if I&apos;m looking in bright sunlight, or on the verge of a sneeze, and I focus on the tightness of her grasp, huffing for breaths between clenching all my muscles to resist the feeling. The hard part is over.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re stupid, that&apos;s what you are,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Is this a joke?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Fine, then,&quot; I say. &quot;We&apos;ll leave in a moment. Wake Ellie upstairs and help her grab all that she needs. And Sylvia, can you help her?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She nods, rising from the couch, but I catch her by the shoulder. &quot;Are you absolutely sure?&quot; I ask. But her expression is resolute, so much that it surprises me. </p>",

It&apos;s my eternal job to worry about you,&quot; I say, with half a smile so that it doesn&apos;t sound mocking or spiteful. And I guess I don&apos;t change either, but that strength I find in sacrifice is for the best of all I touch.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Ellie, grab your things,&quot; I shout. There&apos;s a force that draws me beyond the window like flies trying to escape glass. They&apos;ll be safe without me, I think. I run a long race with no end in sight. My mind begs me to stop. But there&apos;s just enough of a stupid hope inside me that swells with the feeling of fear, reminding me of what I have to lose, and I hate that feeling so much.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I take inventory of my possessions. I still know nothing of this force that drags me back from the edge of death. If I step out there and live, then I know they&apos;re not around. Who says they think I&apos;d end up at home? And if they get me, if I succumb to a rifle blast or die from an arrow to the head, then . . . rolling the dice on this curse of eternal life, I would know the next time around, and maybe, just maybe, we could make it out.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The adrenaline of this edge casts gooseflesh across my arms. I feel warmth like a junkie after their requited hit. It&apos;s not that I want to die or be done.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Standing in the entryway, I think I hear a stirring just beyond the door. Nobody else in the house heard it. I stand silent there, waiting for my ears to ring with enough persuasive silence that the shock of fear subsides. It&apos;s just the wind chimes beyond the door, I think. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then a heavy thud. </p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Footfalls? </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My anxiety overrides my fear and I reach for the handle to throw the door open again, no longer listening for quiet to quell my confusion.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The cold steel knob twists in my hands. I don&apos;t hesitate or draw it slow. And when I open the door, I&apos;m greeted by a sight I haven&apos;t seen since the life I last lived.</p>",

I owe my everything. I am nothing but a waste without my actions to speak for me. And so time passes &mdash; paying no heed to the panic of Lyra and Sylvia, who scrounge for anything to save their foolish lives. It slips away, wiping any chance we had to escape when the Royal Guard first enters the door, stepping over Valentina&apos;s desecrated corpse and whatever ungodly sight Romin left on the porch.</p>",

I pray to Gods for the deliverance to return back, and I swear on the lives of the lost that I will stop at nothing to keep them alive. If I can go back, if I can just return to that night with Sylvia again, then I have the chance to make something of this all. I&apos;ll hold so tightly to my sister that I&apos;ll never let her go. I&apos;ll let nothing distract me from keeping her safe. We&apos;ll run &mdash; I don&apos;t know where we&apos;ll run, but we&apos;ll run &mdash; as far and long as it takes.</p>",

The images don&apos;t flash as quickly as they did last time. There&apos;s a resource within me that can only manage so little. I can see it this time: the reversal of the muzzle flashes that collapse Lyra and Sylvia. Entropy rewinds. The incendiary pellets return to the barrel. A dark figure re-emerges from the door, uttering words in reverse. The hot blood vacates his skin, returning back to the tender spaces inside Valentina, as she mutters her last testament in reverse.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;As the reversal slows, I realize how much of a fool I was to believe this bedlam could have ever been fully fixed. I have no voice to scream as it exits my throat in reverse, as if my petty cries bellow into me rather than out.</p>",

I couldn&apos;t think, just listen and wait, until my body decided to awaken. Staying in one place for too long is now painful: any time my muscles break that stillness, I feel an incredible soreness resist my motion like running underwater. I try to remember. All I know is I reached out to her, to grasp her hand and take her downstairs, but she &mdash; or it &mdash; changed from that form so quickly once it recognized I could tell the difference.</p>",

The pain lessens the more my body moves, and I realize it&apos;s only because I was still for so long. Maybe this is why Everett couldn&apos;t sleep so close to the end of his life, afraid he might die when he awoke the morning after. </p>",

Her stupid optimism sickens me, speaking the line as if it&apos;s all just a play or a film. She knows nothing of the true horrors, the ones that happen far beyond the camera, and the more that annoying insistence shows in her face, the more it pisses me off.</p>",

The hot blood vacates his skin, returning back to the tender spaces inside Valentina, as she mutters her last testament in reverse.</p>",

The motion surprised me, coming from a man of little action, often too depressed to drag himself to his son&apos;s graduation, or to meet his son for dinner on-time when he tries to plan for them to go out.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But I saw a whole different side of him return in that moment of sudden hope, outweighing the darkness of his desperation. His hands dragged at the rubble until they drew blood, frantically scraping until he reached the metal.

        "<p>&emsp;He listened, afraid if he spoke my name that he&apos;d jinx the fortune he prayed for, that it was all another delusion of a dilapidated old man.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But my voice called to him.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Dad,&quot; I said. I wanted to believe that he earned that title.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Son. Son, you&apos;re really there,&quot; Clint said.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t let us out yet. You have to wait. Wait until nobody else is here. This was no accident,&quot; I said, coughing on a mouthful of words with a dry throat.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What? What do you mean by that?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Just trust me. Please,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Trust no one. Not even the people combing the scene. Let nobody know we&apos;re under here. We have to be dead to them.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He had to believe me. It didn&apos;t matter that he understood nothing. &quot;Okay. Okay, son,&quot; he said, rising from the ashen ground.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Clint found a sheet of singed carpet to cover the hatch, leaving minute space for the outside air to cycle. And after his footsteps faded away, the minutes dragged on to hours again, and we felt the day pass us in blind oblivion.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The darktime arrived with flurries of winter. Few snowflakes siphoned through the crack: I could count on the strained fingers of my bad hand the number I saw through the faintest sliver of light.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra leaned against me. We huddled for warmth: there were no blankets or straw or sacks to shield ourselves from the bitter cold. Just the sweaty warmth we saved through hours of breathing each other&apos;s air, slowly wasting away as the heat always loses to the cold.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But Sylvia shivered there in the corner, the names of our dead friends frozen to her blue lips, and the more I watched her suffer with that harrowing truth, the more I sold myself to that promise I wagered with the value of my life.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And so we shiver here now. All I can think of are all the expenses I&apos;ve incurred, indebted to the guilt of this cursed blessing, and the more I yearn to reach out and embrace her, to warm her with that irrational light that comes from nowhere, the more the voice tells me I don&apos;t deserve to relish in those acts of peace. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;That fear of death has left me for now. It&apos;s not the sin itself that fills me with bitter dread, but the parts of me that broke to get here. A river slices rock by a billion narrow cuts. And so the dimensions of my soul shear their edges on the endless cycle of living and dying.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I always believed I was born to be a sacrifice: too broken to thrive, but just strong enough to gust winds into the sails of others. And so maybe that self-fulfilling prophecy has come home. </p>",

        "<p>&emsp;So in that moment, six feet deep beneath the surface of the earth in a communal coffin, I found my rebirth in letting go.

        "<p>&emsp;I count them in twos, and then threes, and then fives, and then tens, over and over and over again. One hundred and thirty seven. But it&apos;s not jars, strands of coarse hair in my jet-black beard, or the number of curses Sylvia still holds against me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Two hundred and ninety-three lines decorate my arm. It&apos;s too dark to see. There&apos;s no light to adjust to beyond the thick steel hatch that sealed out the soot and smoke.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;For hours, touch, taste, and the oddness of that sixth spatial sense tell me the full story of my surroundings. Logic tells me I made an irreversible choice. Hope tells me there&apos;s a way home where Lyra will take us. My ears hear heaving sobs from Sylvia, still hours after we were trapped down here. The sense of space says Lyra and Sylvia are spaced out evenly before me. Panic wonders if they can sense the Amulet. I feel Lyra reach out her hands, and I give it to her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I still taste the brine of preserved pickle juice in my mouth, salty and dry, and my mouth begs for a drink of water. My lungs still irradiate with the faintness of smoke. And Gods, the Chymaeran Curse &mdash; consuming me with each passing second, like feet falling asleep re-urged to motion with a stabbing pain instead of a prickle, makes me wonder how much time I have left.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The City Guard arrived within the first hour, closing off the scene. News travels fast, but not just by the way of information &mdash; the column of smoke must have drawn observers from all around.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;They searched through the wreckage for signs of life. The hatch must be concealed by a slab of concrete or a cross-beam of wood, because the inspectors passed over us, discussing the remnants of the fire.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Four bodies,&quot; a female voice said. &quot;Two look like Academy cadets, so disfigured it&apos;s impossible to tell who they were. One crushed under the rubble, must not have been able to escape the fire. Another on the porch. Two more are Merlot. This must have been another arson attempt,&quot; she concluded.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A brief pause. Then a male voice spoke up. &quot;Stop. No notes, no paperwork. This gets swept under. Orders from above.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;From above?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t ask questions. Just let this go, Detective,&quot; the male voice said.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But the insignia. Wait, look &mdash; there&apos;s no way this was Merlot!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I said enough! Let it go. This goes under as Merlot arson.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But&mdash;&quot; she had no power or words to change his mind. The case is way above both of their heads.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Let&apos;s go. Now,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re here just to say we were here. All for show. The targets are dead.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Another hour passed. The air started running thin, and my head was light. The absence of noise and voices told us that the scene largely cleared out, besides a couple bystanders curious of the morbid sight.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Stop! Hey, what are you doing?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This was my house! Gods . . .&quot; a familiar voice said. &quot;Titus, Ellie . . . You, tell me! Where are the bodies?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This is an ongoing investigation. No information&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Like hell it is!&quot; Things were getting rough. I could hear the thud of someone falling to the floor, either punched or pushed. &quot;My son and my daughter were here! I checked the Academy, went all the way up there. Nothing.&quot; His breaths heaved through his mouth. There was nothing I could say or do.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; the other person said.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No you aren&apos;t,&quot; Clint said. &quot;But if you do anything, leave me here alone. There&apos;s already no bodies to bury or mourn.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Clint sobbed. The same regret I remembered from my first life overwhelmed him. He thought he was alone &mdash; he wouldn&apos;t let anyone catch him in a moment of weakness like this.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Again, a door separated us and I remained silent.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Who is that?&quot; Lyra asked. &quot;Your father?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I nodded, but she didn&apos;t see it in the darkness. She took my silence as confirmation. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I couldn&apos;t see how either of them responded. So I decided to react. I pounded my fists on the metal trap door.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Stop it! We&apos;re better off dead. In everyone&apos;s minds, at least,&quot; Lyra said. Sylvia sat there in the corner, still too angry and overcome with emotion to react.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The ceiling of Clint&apos;s shop is covered with a cheap tarp. It does nothing to keep the cold out. This building was once a house, like many others on the commercial block of Blackwater. Clint stokes the fire, separated from his busywork in the office, but not missing it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Sylvia spoke her first words when we left. The only time before that she interacted with me was to close her eyes and grab the tail of my overcoat when we walked through the smoldering wreckage, still glowing with hot embers, refusing to see the bodies.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Now she sits beside the fire with Clint: their shadows cast on the shelves of timeless tools and trinkets, making them look as if they&apos;re alive.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I can keep you safe here,&quot; Clint insists. &quot;I already lost a daughter. I only got you back just to lose you again, but for what? What&apos;s out there?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;More than charges for a crime we didn&apos;t commit,&quot; I say. &quot;They want us dead for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Pot meet kettle. You sure know about throwing your life away, I almost say, but I don&apos;t want to argue. The image is still fresh in my mind: my father bleeding out in the same room we came together as a family.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;It takes all my restraint not to hit him in front of Lyra and Sylvia. All the hate I&apos;ve built against him rises to the surface. It&apos;s the feel of a natural habit, like his smoking, edging me closer to the endless cycle of conflict where nobody wins and nobody listens.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;In the absence of words, Clint continues. &quot;It&apos;s been a matter of days and you&apos;ve changed so much. You used to be open about things. I mean, you&apos;re still shit at asking for help, but you won&apos;t tell me at all what you&apos;re going through. You haven&apos;t even told me what happened in the house,&quot; he adds.</p>",

I spent so much of my time with him in anger that I never noticed the way his wrinkles crease on frown lines, worn to sorrow like aged leather. My anger dissolves and all I feel is bad for him.</p>",

I need to talk to my son in private.&quot; Clint gestures out the back. From the way he tensions his fists, I can tell we&apos;re going to fight again.

        "<p>&emsp;I wipe off a faint layer of dirty, ashen snow for us to sit. He draws a cigarette from his pocket, flicking the lighter several times before the smoke blends with his clouds of breath, and after he&apos;s satisfied, he starts.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I hate how much of myself I see inside you,&quot; he says. &quot;Every parent wants their child to be better than them. You graduated at the top of your class. Your combat scores are nearly unmatched. Believe me, son, I&apos;ve watched, even if it never felt like it. I&apos;m proud of you. But the more you grind yourself down, the more I see the way that you, well . . .&quot;</p>",

You hold on to work, combat training, school, and Ellie, and I understand why, but your friends? Your youth? Those are all so important.

He&apos;d disappear for days, sometimes. And when I came home from Seminary, he&apos;d just be lying there on the couch, passed out.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Asleep?&quot; I asked.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Right, and . . . some nights I&apos;d curl up next to him: thirsty and starving. I&apos;d lift his arm and put it around me, and Gods, Titus, his body was so fridging cold,&quot; Clint says. &quot;And all I could think was how I never wanted to bring some bastard child into the world, to suffer the same way. But then Everett found you at the orphanage. He insisted we raise you, that there was something special, and then Moira saw that same light when she worked at the orphanage.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean by that? Everett found me?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;He brought you to the Orphanage, but he never said from where, just that he had a &apos;debt to pay.&apos; Moira and Everett are the only reason you&apos;re here with me. But you, son &mdash; you proved me wrong that I didn&apos;t want a child. You&apos;re the reason that Ellie is here. Or was . . . &quot; He takes another draw of his cigarette, adjusting his position on the bench. &quot;Gods be damned. Just don&apos;t end up an old bastard like me, so full of hate, pain, and regret, and &mdash; Titus, why are you crying?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The tears pour out of me. All those cycles wore down the barrier he created for me. &quot;No, continue,&quot; I insist.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, it takes almost losing two of yous before an old stubborn pecker like me can get the words out.&quot; He laughs before it turns into a smoker&apos;s cough. &quot;I know I&apos;m not going to change your mind. I know there&apos;s a part deep inside of you that hates me for what I&apos;ve done &mdash; or rather, failed to do for you as a father. But if it&apos;s not me you talk to about these things, then I urge you to talk to someone. If there&apos;s one thing you remember, it&apos;s this: be better than I was, son.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t hate you,&quot; I tell him.&quot;I just pity how Mom&apos;s death hurt you. I&apos;m . . . saddened by how much it still impacts how you live.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Clint rubs under his chin before closing the cigarette pack. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;And another thing. I know you haven&apos;t forgotten what . . . what I did to you, that terrible night that your mother disappeared. But I&apos;ll be damned if I don&apos;t speak on it. I want to tell you I&apos;m sorry, son, for how I hurt you. Physically, emotionally.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Thank you,&quot; I say. They&apos;re tough words for him to muster, only drawn out by how temporal this last moment of ours is. Emotion is a muscle to train, and we&apos;re both weak and emaciated in those respects: it feels as if we&apos;ve finished a tough workout. There&apos;s so much more to unpack between the two of us. But we both understand we&apos;re out of time. </p>",

I can tell how badly he doesn&apos;t want me to leave, but it&apos;s not up to him. I&apos;m doing this to save all of them. I&apos;ll have to hold myself to this purpose even if it destroys me, because if I fail, I will have nothing to live for.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Here,&quot; he says, gesturing towards a weathered bench in the backyard. &quot;Siddown.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I wipe off a faint layer of dirty, ashen snow for us to sit. He draws a cigarette from his pocket, flicking the lighter several times before the smoke blends with his clouds of breath, and after he&apos;s satisfied, he starts.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re just as stubborn a son of a bitch as I am,&quot; Clint says. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I open my mouth to respond, but he catches me first. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This will work better if you just listen, son,&quot; he says, as if the feeling behind his words will evaporate if he fails to get them out. &quot;Look &mdash; I know I can&apos;t change your mind. You nearly raised yourself. And Ellie, too, I&apos;ll admit . . . so I recognize I have little power over that compass inside you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He sits close to me. The smells of smoke and damp pine bark bring me straight back to my childhood: he started smoking again shortly after my mother died. He quit shortly after I was adopted.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I hate how much of myself I see inside you,&quot; he says. &quot;Every parent wants their child to be better than them. You graduated at the top of your class. Your combat scores are nearly unmatched. Believe me, son, I&apos;ve watched, even if it never felt like it. I&apos;m proud of you. But the more you grind yourself down, the more I see the way that you, well . . .&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He takes a long breath. &quot;Ever since your mother died, ever since that night, it seems like me &mdash; or the world &mdash; tore something out of you.&quot; He pauses for effect as I cross my legs. &quot;And it&apos;s like you never filled it with something real.&quot; He digs deep into a part of me I&apos;m uncomfortable with, but this time it isn&apos;t insults or allegations. &quot;I can tell because I have it, too. And I think I passed it on to you, as much as I tried to be better than my father was.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But we&apos;re different,&quot; I try to say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You really think? I see this shop as the only relic of my past that remains the way she left it,&quot; he says, &quot;and I hold on to this. You hold on to work, combat training, school, and Ellie, and I understand why, but your friends? Your youth? Those are all so important. I didn&apos;t have that, I never did, because I had to grow up fast. But look at you &mdash; young and handsome like I was. You shouldn&apos;t have those limitations.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I take care of Ellie because you say you can&apos;t,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But if you dig deep, you know neither of us can . . . or could, Gods . . . give her the love she deserved.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I sit with the silence that follows. I won&apos;t deny his words. I don&apos;t want to admit it out loud, but he&apos;s right: I chalked all of Ellie&apos;s frustrations up to adolescent drama without ever really listening to her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What I&apos;m trying to say here is: I don&apos;t want you to make the same mistake I did, to carry that same weakness my own father left in me.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He takes a long pause, failing to find a way to summarize the scars of his past in a handful of words.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It was awful,&quot; Clint says. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He bites his lip.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Go on,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Your grandfather, Everett,&quot; Clint starts. &quot;He was a weak man. Something in his past still hurt him, and he never quite got it out.&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I lean forward, mesmerized by his words. I&apos;ve never heard him even try to talk this much about his past. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t want to tell you since he was your only grandparent, and that connection is important, with how small our family is, you know.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I nod for him to continue, looking down, afraid that if we meet eyes he&apos;ll stop talking.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Your grandmother died at a young age, much like what happened with Moira. And that&apos;s why it hurts so much this time. But I remember my early life in Blackwater, living in a house that wasn&apos;t even close to the size we had, far on the outskirts, close to the Snowdrifter holes. He&apos;d disappear for days, sometimes. And when I came home from Seminary, he&apos;d just be lying there on the couch, passed out.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Asleep?&quot; I asked.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No. Black-out drunk. And I spent so much of my life just sitting there in that empty house, just staring.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;At what?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;At his breath. His chest, up and down, up and down, just watching.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;To make sure he was alive,&quot; I guess.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Right, and . . . some nights I&apos;d curl up next to him: thirsty and starving. I&apos;d lift his arm and put it around me, and Gods, Titus, his body was so fridging cold,&quot; Clint says. &quot;And all I could think was how I never wanted to bring some bastard child into the world, to suffer the same way. But then Everett found you at the orphanage. He insisted we raise you, that there was something special, and then Moira saw that same light when she worked at the orphanage.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean by that? Everett found me?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;He brought you to the Orphanage, but he never said from where, just that he had a &apos;debt to pay.&apos; Moira and Everett are the only reason you&apos;re here with me. But you, son &mdash; you proved me wrong that I didn&apos;t want a child. You&apos;re the reason that Ellie is here. Or was . . . &quot; He takes another draw of his cigarette, adjusting his position on the bench. &quot;Gods be damned. Just don&apos;t end up an old bastard like me, so full of hate, pain, and regret, and &mdash; Titus, why are you crying?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The tears pour out of me. All those cycles wore down the barrier he created for me. &quot;No, continue,&quot; I insist.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, it takes almost losing two of yous before an old stubborn pecker like me can get the words out.&quot; He laughs before it turns into a smoker&apos;s cough. &quot;I know I&apos;m not going to change your mind. I know there&apos;s a part deep inside of you that hates me for what I&apos;ve done &mdash; or rather, failed to do for you as a father. But if it&apos;s not me you talk to about these things, then I urge you to talk to someone. If there&apos;s one thing you remember, it&apos;s this: be better than I was, son.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t hate you,&quot; I tell him.&quot;I just pity how Mom&apos;s death hurt you. I&apos;m . . . saddened by how much it still impacts how you live.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Clint rubs under his chin before closing the cigarette pack. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;And another thing. I know you haven&apos;t forgotten what . . . what I did to you, that terrible night that your mother disappeared. But I&apos;ll be damned if I don&apos;t speak on it. I want to tell you I&apos;m sorry, son, for how I hurt you. Physically, emotionally.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Thank you,&quot; I say. They&apos;re tough words for him to muster, only drawn out by how temporal this last moment of ours is. Emotion is a muscle to train, and we&apos;re both weak and emaciated in those respects: it feels as if we&apos;ve finished a tough workout. There&apos;s so much more to unpack between the two of us. But we both understand we&apos;re out of time. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Clint stands up. He trades clouds of smoke for clouds of breath as he stretches his sore back, and I stand alongside him. I can tell how badly he doesn&apos;t want me to leave, but it&apos;s not up to him. I&apos;m doing this to save all of them. I&apos;ll have to hold myself to this purpose even if it destroys me, because if I fail, I will have nothing to live for.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He reaches out his hand as if we&apos;re making a business deal. But the feel of something smooth, cold, and slender surprises me between our palms.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;If I can&apos;t convince you to stay, then I want her to protect you,&quot; Clint says. &quot;You&apos;ll need her presence more than I will.&quot;</p>",

I have a power that might make me even stronger than the Gods, but in no way do I equate myself above them. I&apos;m not like Ullrich and the prideful Afterlives.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s a major battle coming,&quot; Lyra insists, and her senses are right. Beyond the walls of the house, the infighting between the Merlot and Carmine has already begun, with or without Romin and Valentina, weakening the fabric of Blackwater for the perfect attack. &quot;Follow me back to the First Red, and you&apos;ll be entering a hard life of conflict against the forces of pure evil. But as Academy cadets on the cusp of graduation, we all know you&apos;ve steeled yourself for that life.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;That path is my only means to an end. </p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This train isn&apos;t for that waste of life and effort they call service. It&apos;s for something different. It&apos;s for the service of the lower ranks, the ones they deem useless,&quot; she says.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s a far bigger world than either of you can ever imagine. It is filled with horrors far beyond anything your narrow perception of life grants you here,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Do you ever ask yourself why so few people starve, where the endless supply of produce comes from, and where&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Her words halt in an instant, suddenly attuned to something we can&apos;t sense.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Who&apos;s here?&quot; I ask.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;I squint my eyes to accomodate the familiar silhouettes when they enter.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can&apos;t believe what I see. It is all so impossible: they take the form of the two childhood friends I&apos;ve loved as if I never lost them. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I feel my heart skip for a second before I remember Lyra&apos;s words, and I know Sylvia reacts the same way.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A different Valentina and Romin stand at the door. Their mannerisms are convincing. Only I can tell they&apos;re slightly off.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;These are the Chymaerans that will take us,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;They hold to the true spirit of Blackwater, long before royalty bastardized its nature.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Romin looks on with amethyst eyes, speaking with a voice that I remember. &quot;I&apos;m sorry. The bodies of your friends are unidentifiable. With this form, it will be to Blackwater as if they never left.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina&apos;s clone opens her mouth, and her voice is just as convincing. &quot;Now is our window. We need to leave,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I take Sylvia&apos;s hand. She tensions her fingers in mine, standing tall for the first time since I can remember, rising to that half-inch-or-so she has over me, holding my hand gently as she looks on towards the world outside. That same feeling of love comes back to me again and I allow it to flow over me, putting off the truth that whatever actions await us are meaningless and temporal if they&apos;re to be overwritten.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But I relish in it for now: I allow it to recharge my weathered soul. I&apos;ll tell her about this curse, whether she believes me or not. Even though she&apos;ll lose her memory of it when time resets. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Gods know how long peace will take, but I want to believe in the waning strength I have to continue, between my soul and the Chymaeran Curse that has stretched so far in little time.</p>",

The two separatist Chymaerans morphed from familiar faces to random railworkers.

Their speech was convincing, carrying the slang and tone of the impoverished outwallers, the same style I recognized in my father.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Both recalled their hosts&apos; memories of Blackwater industry, and the clothes they conjured were an extension of their bodies&apos; Essence. The materials were astounding, so close to the true textures only touch could differentiate them. The fabrics folded like true cloth, but to the touch, every part of their disguise felt like frigid iron.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Put &apos;ese on,&quot; the blonde Chymaeran said. Industry clothes, fashioned from the power of Chymaeran and Human Essence masterfully intertwined together. The scarred Chymaeran recalled their hosts&apos; memories of childhood playing on the tracks, long enough ago that trains still ran through the station. Although a large steel-barred fence deterred scavengers and vagrants, the scarred recalled a small space dug beneath the bottom, where ages ago their guise snuck through.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The land just beyond the station was decrepit and undeveloped. Containers rotted to rust from snow and ice, and so much trash and waste sullied the dirt with rancid odors. The train station at the center was the only stone monolith to defy the slagyards, although its age showed in dusty shattered glass and worn engravings on the walls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Chymaerans&apos; clothes dissolved to amorphous black, and in less than a blink they metastasized again as the fine robes of the Royal Guard.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The one that guised Romin instructed us to play along, with their tongue changed to high speech. They had a cleaner face and a refined look, despite the consistent, straggling scar slicing straight down their face.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;No one asks that many questions if you&apos;re carrying tools somewhere. I picked up a long rusted crescent wrench from atop an iron barrel to further my disguise, and our bags only added to the persuasion. We circled the perimeter of the building for the side entrance. Several technicians sat on petrified stumps just beyond the heavy-duty side door, warming their hands over a barrel. A single Royal Guard observed them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He turned to us. &quot;Finally, about time those bloody-damn railmen showed up,&quot; he said. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They &apos;ad us prepping these cars for weeks, and you cunts show at the last minute,&quot; one railmen complains. &quot;Still got two carts needin&apos; a lathe, so get on it, fresh blood!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Lathe?&quot; Sylvia asks. I know what it is from my time in the machine shop, but the scarred answers her first, in a hushed whisper.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But I don&apos;t know how to use it,&quot; Sylvia says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I got some&apos;in you can use!&quot; One says.</p>",

They grumbled, back to their drivel about sex and drinking. &quot;And you two,&quot; he said, pointing to the guised Chymaerans, &quot;what are your plans with those shitbloods?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I spoke up. &quot;We&apos;re maintenance crew for the&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Royal Guard struck me across the face without a moment&apos;s hesitation. He didn&apos;t even bother to meet my eyes, turning to the Chymaerans. &quot;One more word and that worker is leaving its crew in a body bag,&quot; he said. &quot;Now what are they here for?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The scarred regurgitated my lines. &quot;Maintenance on the couplings. Cycled strain between the forty-seven and forty-eight couplings are long overdue. Age and impulse loads stretch far beyond infinite yield.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Enough big words. Royal Guard shouldn&apos;t partake in that feculent tongue. Do what you have to,&quot; he said, and we passed through the door, eyes down, sure to make no contact with any of the Royal Guard. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It.&quot; Gods, I&apos;d almost forgotten how much irrational hatred the upper scumbags have for our people. Lyra tensioned her fists, the same thought on her mind.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The blonde Chymaeran tugged my shirt. &quot;It&apos;s best if I do the talking here,&quot; he said, and I nodded in response.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;On the platform of the stabling area, where the ready trains awaited departure, the scarred approached a group of higher-level Royal Guards. He recalled the thoughts of his precious guise. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;These shitbloods are doing maintenance on the couplings. We only have time for loaded carriages since they&apos;ll take the most force. Do you know which have pre-loaded?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;One of them pointed to three cars, painted with a green dash I could only imagine meant READY FOR DEPARTURE. As they asked the Chymaerans about the logistics of the maintenance job, I listened in to the other guards discussing the details of their next move.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Prepare the carriages for fuel. Purgatory is on the way,&quot; an intercom buzzed. Few lower tradesmen remained in the belly of the depot. Colors of jade and vermilion swarmed the spaces between the tracks like a muddle of ants carrying leaves and fruit. Purgatory? As in a place? A weapon?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Prepare for departure. Loading will begin in one hour,&quot; the announcement spoke.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We need to get us in the storage cars,&quot; the blonde Chymaeran said, but my mind was wrapped in the mystery of my surroundings. So many storage cars: empty, without seats or soft flooring. It couldn&apos;t be for liquid fuel. Maybe lumber? No, that wouldn&apos;t make sense &mdash; all the trees are outside these walls. That&apos;d be like exporting water to a lake.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;With an hour until departure, at a moment when the guards&apos; eyes no longer watched our hands pretending to tinker with the machinery, we dipped into the second loaded car, throwing the heavy door aside just far enough to squeeze through. Despite the climate of our lands, the carriage was hot and stuffy, but we didn&apos;t dare open the doors again to vent. We suffered through this for hours in the bootlegger hatch, and it didn&apos;t trouble us to tough it out for a little longer. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Our Chymaerans locked the latches from the inside. Commanding shouts and screeching cars shook the floor of Carriage Forty-Eight. And as soon as the darkness concealed them, my eyes could no longer discern the shape of the Chymaerans. Just a darkness blacker than black, as if their bodies starved the space of every ribbon of light.</p>",
        "Our disguises dissolved faster than a fake smile without a witness, leaving us in our travel clothes. We wouldn&apos;t need our coats until rushing polar winds could breach the splintered slats, so we sat in silence for that hour, trying to discern the voices of a large crowd ushered towards the cars. What lucky bastards we were when we realized what we missed."

The materials were astounding, so close to the true textures only touch could differentiate them. The fabrics folded like true cloth, but to the touch, every part of their disguise felt like frigid iron.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Put &apos;ese on,&quot; the blonde Chymaeran said. Industry clothes, fashioned from the power of Chymaeran and Human Essence masterfully intertwined together. The scarred Chymaeran recalled their hosts&apos; memories of childhood playing on the tracks, long enough ago that trains still ran through the station. Although a large steel-barred fence deterred scavengers and vagrants, the scarred recalled a small space dug beneath the bottom, where ages ago their guise snuck through.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The land just beyond the station was decrepit and undeveloped. Containers rotted to rust from snow and ice, and so much trash and waste sullied the dirt with rancid odors. The train station at the center was the only stone monolith to defy the slagyards, although its age showed in dusty shattered glass and worn engravings on the walls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Chymaerans&apos; clothes dissolved to amorphous black, and in less than a blink they metastasized again as the fine robes of the Royal Guard.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The one that guised Romin instructed us to play along, with their tongue changed to high speech. They had a cleaner face and a refined look, despite the consistent, straggling scar slicing straight down their face.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The blonde Chymaeran turned to us. &quot;You&apos;re a maintenance crew, performing inspection on the coupling between coffin car 46 and 47.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;No one asks that many questions if you&apos;re carrying tools somewhere. I picked up a long rusted crescent wrench from atop an iron barrel to further my disguise, and our bags only added to the persuasion. We circled the perimeter of the building for the side entrance. Several technicians sat on petrified stumps just beyond the heavy-duty side door, warming their hands over a barrel. A single Royal Guard observed them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He turned to us. &quot;Finally, about time those bloody-damn railmen showed up,&quot; he said. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They &apos;ad us prepping these cars for weeks, and you cunts show at the last minute,&quot; one railmen complains. &quot;Still got two carts needin&apos; a lathe, so get on it, fresh blood!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Lathe?&quot; Sylvia asks. I know what it is from my time in the machine shop, but the scarred answers her first, in a hushed whisper.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Wheel lathe, he says. Profiles the wheels before departure. Keep them round.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But I don&apos;t know how to use it,&quot; Sylvia says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I got some&apos;in you can use!&quot; One says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;An&apos;ya got a bitch workin&apos; lines?&quot; They say, when Sylvia appears from behind me. &quot;Fine, too.  Nice knockers &mdash; guess whorin&apos; these days is so bad you gotta do a man&apos;s work.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Why don&apos;t ya polish my shaft,&quot; another says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s enough from you. Get back to work, shitbloods,&quot; the lone Royal Guard said. They grumbled, back to their drivel about sex and drinking. &quot;And you two,&quot; he said, pointing to the guised Chymaerans, &quot;what are your plans with those shitbloods?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I spoke up. &quot;We&apos;re maintenance crew for the&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Royal Guard struck me across the face without a moment&apos;s hesitation. He didn&apos;t even bother to meet my eyes, turning to the Chymaerans. &quot;One more word and that worker is leaving its crew in a body bag,&quot; he said. &quot;Now what are they here for?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The scarred regurgitated my lines. &quot;Maintenance on the couplings. Cycled strain between the forty-seven and forty-eight couplings are long overdue. Age and impulse loads stretch far beyond infinite yield.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Enough big words. Royal Guard shouldn&apos;t partake in that feculent tongue. Do what you have to,&quot; he said, and we passed through the door, eyes down, sure to make no contact with any of the Royal Guard. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It.&quot; Gods, I&apos;d almost forgotten how much irrational hatred the upper scumbags have for our people. Lyra tensioned her fists, the same thought on her mind.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The blonde Chymaeran tugged my shirt. &quot;It&apos;s best if I do the talking here,&quot; he said, and I nodded in response.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;On the platform of the stabling area, where the ready trains awaited departure, the scarred approached a group of higher-level Royal Guards. He recalled the thoughts of his precious guise. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;These shitbloods are doing maintenance on the couplings. We only have time for loaded carriages since they&apos;ll take the most force. Do you know which have pre-loaded?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;One of them pointed to three cars, painted with a green dash I could only imagine meant READY FOR DEPARTURE. As they asked the Chymaerans about the logistics of the maintenance job, I listened in to the other guards discussing the details of their next move.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Prepare the carriages for fuel. Purgatory is on the way,&quot; an intercom buzzed. Few lower tradesmen remained in the belly of the depot. Colors of jade and vermilion swarmed the spaces between the tracks like a muddle of ants carrying leaves and fruit. Purgatory? As in a place? A weapon?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Prepare for departure. Loading will begin in one hour,&quot; the announcement spoke.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We need to get us in the storage cars,&quot; the blonde Chymaeran said, but my mind was wrapped in the mystery of my surroundings. So many storage cars: empty, without seats or soft flooring. It couldn&apos;t be for liquid fuel. Maybe lumber? No, that wouldn&apos;t make sense &mdash; all the trees are outside these walls. That&apos;d be like exporting water to a lake.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;With an hour until departure, at a moment when the guards&apos; eyes no longer watched our hands pretending to tinker with the machinery, we dipped into the second loaded car, throwing the heavy door aside just far enough to squeeze through. Despite the climate of our lands, the carriage was hot and stuffy, but we didn&apos;t dare open the doors again to vent. We suffered through this for hours in the bootlegger hatch, and it didn&apos;t trouble us to tough it out for a little longer. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Our Chymaerans locked the latches from the inside. Commanding shouts and screeching cars shook the floor of Carriage Forty-Eight. And as soon as the darkness concealed them, my eyes could no longer discern the shape of the Chymaerans. Just a darkness blacker than black, as if their bodies starved the space of every ribbon of light.</p>",
        "Our disguises dissolved faster than a fake smile without a witness, leaving us in our travel clothes. We wouldn&apos;t need our coats until rushing polar winds could breach the splintered slats, so we sat in silence for that hour, trying to discern the voices of a large crowd ushered towards the cars. What lucky bastards we were when we realized what we missed."

    [
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I never knew there was this much sky out there,&quot; says Sylvia, captivated by the sights unfolding like pages from my grandfather&apos;s old storybooks. The light lasts just long enough to bless the world with one last flood of color, spilling all the paints across the sky before sepia swallows the world. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;In my mind&apos;s eye I remember the first Snowdrifter trips with my grandfather, when I began building my stamina for long treks. He told me to absorb the sights and serenity of life unfolding around me. Listen for the static, can you hear it? He would ask, and I&apos;d listen and listen, waiting for a sound to ring in my ears. I&apos;d get frustrated after a time. I can&apos;t hear it, I&apos;d say. He&apos;d laugh and keep asking over and over, every half an hour, until it became the only thought that filled my mind.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Years later, I considered it was a genius way of getting me to shut up and stop asking if we were there yet. But as age dragged me closer to the edge of graduation, phase after phase until I now realize the true shortness of time, I&apos;ve found what he really meant. The demands of my abruptly-shortened childhood threaten to swallow me alive. I find gray hairs in my beard. I lose weight from malnutrition. And responsibilities have become so severe that the pit in my stomach is a feature, not a sickness.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The older I get, the more I realize that static is just the absence; everything that isn&apos;t. It was the space between the trees when the snow crunched under my small feet. It was the drawn silence between question and answer before Everett would laugh and ask it again. And now it&apos;s the pause between rhythmic jolts of the chassis as the steel screeches against the rails, casting sparks beneath the floor.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can detach my emotions the more I convince myself that this life is temporal. A breadth of time separates me from my loved ones only by a trail of Essence. I can feel the texture of every memory as if it still breathes, like a cherished friend waiting for me to return. And when I look at Lyra and Sylvia, I try harder and harder to separate myself from becoming attached to these afterimages of a failure that will soon be rewritten. These people are temporal too . . . I have to convince myself, I have to believe that.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; Sylvia asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Just some words from my father,&quot; I say. She rests her head against my shoulder. I let it happen, but I turn away. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What did he tell you?&quot; She asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Words he should have said a decade ago,&quot; I say. &quot;But welcome words &mdash; it&apos;s not too late.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m glad you had that chance. You were so different,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re so kind and patient around your friends, but around your father, you&apos;re usually angry and short.&quot; She pauses. &quot;In temper, not&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But you were patient with him this time. I can&apos;t remember the last time I ever saw you like that.&quot;The last fight with him replays in my mind: the sincerity of his regret and the emptiness I found in his heart. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s just the finality of everything. Funny how it drags the words out of us, the ones we&apos;d never say before, huh?&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My spirit longs to open up and tell her everything, but I&apos;m so afraid that if I break apart now, I won&apos;t have the strength to sacrifice for all the ones who didn&apos;t make it: the ones I owe my life to.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You know, sometimes I just wish I wasn&apos;t so weak,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No&mdash;&quot; My face scrunches when I disagree. &quot;You&apos;re not. You and I have been down a terrible, grueling path in each of our lives, yet we&apos;ve both made it this far.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because of how needy I am. It feels like I&apos;m always behind you, tugging at your cloak for you to lead me on, ever since the orphanage. And I feel awful for always being your . . . burden,&quot; she says. That last word parts from her lips like a curse. &quot;And it makes me so sorry for that.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You are never a burden,&quot; I insist, &quot;because we depend on each other. Don&apos;t you ever think that!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&mdash;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; she says, burying her head in my arm before I notice my moment of passion was misread. But&mdash;before I can remind her to stop apologizing for things that aren&apos;t her fault, she continues.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;d tell me that insistence I had earlier to stay by your side was courage,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;Telling you I was in it no matter what. It sounded brave when I said it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It was brave,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But really &mdash; I was so afraid of a world without you that I couldn&apos;t bear to be alone again. The voices, Titus! All the voices of my past have lost their distinction, as those playground kids or abusive adults or . . . the others . . . I wish I could forget. The further time takes me from them and their jeers of how pathetic I am, the more that voice becomes my own. And the more I hear myself, the harder it is to hear anything else.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s strength to you, then? Brawn like Romin? Charisma like Valentina?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Resilience like you,&quot; she says. &quot;Strong enough to carry the weight of the world. Honed and one-pointed enough to let the pain pass through you. Direction. Conviction.&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And maybe that&apos;s the image that burned in her mind for the months I was asleep in the Afterlife. That&apos;s what she almost became. And maybe at the end of it she understood just like I do that the pain never passes through. It&apos;s an act of atrophy, constantly adding wax and sculpting a candle that burns from both ends. And maybe I&apos;ve become convincing enough to hide it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And that&apos;s exactly why I find myself weak,&quot; I say. Because I fail to find the strength or words to tell her how I feel. Even now. I didn&apos;t lie when I told Romin I was always running from that feeling that drags behind me like my own shadow. And the image of my father&apos;s weakness shows me, again, that freedom I&apos;m so afraid of.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Sometimes it feels like you&apos;re the last light that survived from those times of innocence. You&apos;ve always protected me. I just wish I could do more,&quot; Sylvia says, as she snuggles up to my arm, completely unaware of the comfort and fullness she&apos;s brought to me&mdash;though I&apos;ve always fumbled on the words to tell her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Maybe I can do it this time.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You do enough,&quot; I mutter.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Huh?&quot; She says. Her beautiful crimson eyes meet mine, and for a moment, my voice wavers. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You always do enough. Because . . . you&apos;re the reason I&apos;ve made it this far, too.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus,&quot; she says. My name is so sweet from her lips, and then I feel it: how something so softly opens inside me, before I can recapture it; how I spent all those years pounding at the door when all I needed was patience and clemency. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can feel my face so magnetically drawn to hers, and I realize I&apos;ve always felt it, that feeling, and the last thought I manage is to contemplate the softness of her lips.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Then the train lurches to a halt. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We don&apos;t. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The wheels no longer mask the sound of shouts and screams beyond the car. It&apos;s only then that we realize what the &quot;fuel&quot; is, faster than our bodies slam against the hay bales along the front wall.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I hear the voices of cadets, no older than I am, crying out into the night. Fists pound on the walls and doors of the train like lumberjacks chopping a full forest, and moments later, from the shear force of a hundred bodies pressing against the wooden panels, the walls snap, relieving several cars of imprisoned cadets like barrels of wine struck with an axe.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Now! Run for the tree line,&quot; a weak voice calls. I can see them now: cadets of the lowest class in the Academy. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The highest class, Dragon Class, is sent beyond the walls to fight at the highest ranks, or to defend the Afterlife from unrest. The middle, Garnet Class, often ends up guarding the outer city. I always wondered what became of the lowest cadets who weren&apos;t called to the highest honors.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Their resistance is futile. The Chymaeran Royal Guards dissolve to sickly caricatures of obsidian, their limbs sharper than the branches of the leafless trees. With so much time spent in darkness my eyes cannot afford me any color, but I can see the snow runs dark, and I know on the other side of the snow banks lie the lower cadets who were foolish enough to try to escape first.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Do we run for it? What do we do?&quot; Sylvia asks. The panic flashes in her eyes, but Lyra remains calm, turning to the Chymaerans with a trail of blood running from her forehead.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;ll think we&apos;re escapees that are hiding out in a storage car,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;We can&apos;t walk from here. Not at night, and not in the cold when we have so far still to go.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A voice thunders from the front of the train. Each syllable trembles in the floorboards, shaking loose fasteners like chattering teeth. &quot;There&apos;a nowhere to run. Stay inside the train or else you will freeze and die.&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Escape is futile without the directional sense that leads you home &mdash; or a map like the one my grandfather left me of the lands beyond the wall. No wonder they outlawed that magnetic tool Everett had that points towards the city, saying it&apos;s an &quot;item that dishonors the unified spirit of Blackwater.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra turns to the Chymaerans. &quot;Play this off if they ever come by.&quot; They emerge from the corner, creatures of darkness whose bodies seem to soak all the light. But my eyes have adjusted and I see them now: hard-shelled flesh like steel armor, a triangle of three glowing, amethyst dots on their heads I can only interpret as eyes.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A vibration shudders from deep within their throat, as if their vocal cords were feathered by the fronds of a comb instead of a violin&apos;s bow. The sound takes shape until it morphs into human speech, and I realize the sheer range of mastery these half-blood Chymaerans have with guising.</p>",
        "And just like them, I&apos;ve changed in an instant, too: furious now with my waning patience for how many distractions tear me from any moment of peace."

        "<p>&emsp;I poke my head out of the car, just enough to take in a flash of information.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;How did they get to the emergency stop?&quot; a half-blood guard says, still in human form.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They didn&apos;t,&quot; another says. &quot;We found a metal rod jammed in the wheels from part of the trolley frame.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Three cabins down, the car has its door thrown open. &quot;Run and you&apos;ll go nowhere, shitbloods! I don&apos;t have to kill you now to know you&apos;ll die out there,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Damn you! All we have to do is take this train over,&quot; a cadet says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Make it an example,&quot; a Guard demands. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My curiosity draws me beyond the edge of the doorframe again. The Cadet is lifted into the air, his flesh surging bright amethyst. And it&apos;s only after I notice the height his feet hang from the ground that I see how massive this Chymaeran is. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The convenient thing about fuel like this is that it&apos;s all out of Essence. So those small diseases of the past,&quot; the Guard continues, watching the Chymaeran brute choke out the rebel as his flesh grows pale, &quot;are enough to turn a cough to cancer.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The dark, glowing amethyst trail reaches the cadet&apos;s heart from his neck. In a matter of moments his body dissolves to blackened ash. His raw Essence is absorbed into the circuits of his abuser.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that all the cadets&apos; restraint dissolves, leaving nothing but the hatred and primal fury of fighters that were bred to die. It takes so little effort for the lone Chymaeran brute to eviscerate everything that breathes in the train car, and although I don&apos;t see the bloodbath, I can hear the sound of slender limbs slicing flesh; the drumming beat of cadets as their bodies fall, reduced to dust, filling this creature with the soul and fleeting strength of the dead.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My anger builds further, as if their last stand has spread the contagion of furious spite. I can&apos;t care for death when I know time will reset me, even if it&apos;s to this exact moment that rage primes my muscles.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The guards now approach us. I know the sacrifice I have to make, and I know I have to stop them. I won&apos;t die a martyr like Romin if I can&apos;t die: all I want is to release the vitriol that poisons my heart. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My hands tension around the shaft of a fire axe left on the ground of the train car. My mind is set. But a hand tugs on the back of my coat when I step off the platform.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What are you doing, Titus?&quot; Sylvia asks. &quot;Don&apos;t just throw your life away!&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But I won&apos;t just throw it away. I can&apos;t. Not now and not ever again. I won&apos;t need warmth for the short struggle that comes next: my body burns hot with adrenaline and excitement, as if that edge of life and death is an addictive drug that I&apos;ve relapsed on.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I shed the coat.&quot;You can&apos;t throw away eternal life,&quot; I say. I tried to explain it to her, to all of them, though I know she will never understand. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My hands tension further until my knuckles turn whiter than the snow, frosted skin redder than the blood of those cadets that didn&apos;t turn to ash quick enough. The Vassal skips a train car to approach, thinking me another stupid cadet that wants to die. But all I want is to leverage that unfillable, longing emptiness through my fists. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And that fury must be genetic.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The tears I shed over and over a day ago refill my eyes, trembling my voice as I cry out. And although the Chymaeran Curse scalds my flesh with violent heat, surging stronger in my veins as they approach, I know this will be a short conflict.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s too late to turn back when the Vassal charges, still famished for Life Essence to feed, the very image of Lionshead&apos;s wickedness incarnated before me, preparing for that day atop the mountain when all of Blackwater&apos;s life Essence will flood them with the power of two races.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I scream my treasured sister&apos;s name as a battle cry, unbundling with it the curses and vitriol of helpless anger as a useless brother and worse friend. I swing first with all my might, channeling all the strength I can into the head of the axe, although the muscles in my right arm are strained from amethyst pain. I don&apos;t care that the dark roots have already crawled my arm and up my shoulder. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;All I care is that this ends.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s like swinging at a rigid metal bar when it shields itself with its arms. The clang of that strike vibrates through my hands, echoing through the forest, and I hear the cheers of cadets in a lower train car, shouting my name, as they saw me moments earlier at Graduation.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp; Despite a story of height, the Vassal looks genuinely scared, but that doesn&apos;t stop it from dealing eviscerating blows. Drawn back by the momentum of the large axe, I stagger backwards, taking the wooden shaft in both my hands to block.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It makes sounds as if trying to speak, surely insulting me and my pettiness.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I dive to the side when the serrated edge slashes down on me. Dirt and snow erupt from the ground like lakewater splashing from a falling boulder. My vision is consumed by powder, but I charge forward anyways, channeling all that fury into another swing at nothing.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m lucky when it connects. The great Chymaeran is furious now, as if it wasn&apos;t before, but it still refuses to use all its strength. Probably to put on a show of little effort for its handlers, I think, before its first connecting swing shatters the butt of the axe, nearly whacking me off my feet.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra holds back Sylvia, insisting that I&apos;m &quot;already lost and beyond saving.&quot; I can feel the crack propagate when I strike again: the wooden shaft has hardly any metal left to hold on to. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My strike deals just as much damage as it did before. Absolutely nothing. Maybe a scratch, more just an annoyance, but my mission isn&apos;t to win.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The attack I&apos;ve waited for comes after my hands strain from all hard metal contact. I reach, weakly, to block with the wooden throat of the axe, but the force behind the Chymaeran&apos;s blade shatters it like a toothpick. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m surprised, but not by its raw power. With such force, its downward strike never even reaches the ground. I look down at my chest: a large crimson line traces from my left shoulder to my right hip. I grasp my chest, expecting my insides to spill, but I&apos;m surprised when the wound is only skin deep. My father always taught me to swing through your target, not just to make contact, and with all the bisected torsos of cadets in the train car I can see now, it&apos;s undeniable. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Vassal is pulling punches.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My fight is over as soon as I fall to my back, and the great obsidian beast stands over me. I don&apos;t have the stamina to flinch when one of the sharp edges of its arms stabs into the shoulder of my bad arm, pinning me against the ground. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I expect it could dice me to shreds like all those other cadets, but all I can see is the pain of this creature. It trembles with an unsettling fear for something so large, as if it tries to speak again. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can&apos;t move. All I can feel is the amethyst probing further into my blood. The pain subsides as my nerves no longer feel the cold of the wasteland. My arms and legs no longer hinge. My muscles refuse to budge as my breaths grow shallower, and I realize the vassal has granted me a merciful death.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;I poke my head out of the car, just enough to take in a flash of information.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;How did they get to the emergency stop?&quot; a half-blood guard says, still in human form.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They didn&apos;t,&quot; another says. &quot;We found a metal rod jammed in the wheels from part of the trolley frame.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Three cabins down, the car has its door thrown open. &quot;Run and you&apos;ll go nowhere, shitbloods! I don&apos;t have to kill you now to know you&apos;ll die out there,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Damn you! All we have to do is take this train over,&quot; a cadet says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Make it an example,&quot; a Guard demands. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My curiosity draws me beyond the edge of the doorframe again. The Cadet is lifted into the air, his flesh surging bright amethyst. And it&apos;s only after I notice the height his feet hang from the ground that I see how massive this Chymaeran is. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The convenient thing about fuel like this is that it&apos;s all out of Essence. So those small diseases of the past,&quot; the Guard continues, watching the Chymaeran brute choke out the rebel as his flesh grows pale, &quot;are enough to turn a cough to cancer.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The dark, glowing amethyst trail reaches the cadet&apos;s heart from his neck. In a matter of moments his body dissolves to blackened ash. His raw Essence is absorbed into the circuits of his abuser.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that all the cadets&apos; restraint dissolves, leaving nothing but the hatred and primal fury of fighters that were bred to die. It takes so little effort for the lone Chymaeran brute to eviscerate everything that breathes in the train car, and although I don&apos;t see the bloodbath, I can hear the sound of slender limbs slicing flesh; the drumming beat of cadets as their bodies fall, reduced to dust, filling this creature with the soul and fleeting strength of the dead.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My anger builds further, as if their last stand has spread the contagion of furious spite. I can&apos;t care for death when I know time will reset me, even if it&apos;s to this exact moment that rage primes my muscles.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The guards now approach us. I know the sacrifice I have to make, and I know I have to stop them. I won&apos;t die a martyr like Romin if I can&apos;t die: all I want is to release the vitriol that poisons my heart. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My hands tension around the shaft of a fire axe left on the ground of the train car. My mind is set. But a hand tugs on the back of my coat when I step off the platform.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What are you doing, Titus?&quot; Sylvia asks. &quot;Don&apos;t just throw your life away!&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But I won&apos;t just throw it away. I can&apos;t. Not now and not ever again. I won&apos;t need warmth for the short struggle that comes next: my body burns hot with adrenaline and excitement, as if that edge of life and death is an addictive drug that I&apos;ve relapsed on.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I shed the coat.&quot;You can&apos;t throw away eternal life,&quot; I say. I tried to explain it to her, to all of them, though I know she will never understand. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My hands tension further until my knuckles turn whiter than the snow, frosted skin redder than the blood of those cadets that didn&apos;t turn to ash quick enough. The Vassal skips a train car to approach, thinking me another stupid cadet that wants to die. But all I want is to leverage that unfillable, longing emptiness through my fists. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And that fury must be genetic.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The tears I shed over and over a day ago refill my eyes, trembling my voice as I cry out. And although the Chymaeran Curse scalds my flesh with violent heat, surging stronger in my veins as they approach, I know this will be a short conflict.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s too late to turn back when the Vassal charges, still famished for Life Essence to feed, the very image of Lionshead&apos;s wickedness incarnated before me, preparing for that day atop the mountain when all of Blackwater&apos;s life Essence will flood them with the power of two races.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I scream my treasured sister&apos;s name as a battle cry, unbundling with it the curses and vitriol of helpless anger as a useless brother and worse friend. I swing first with all my might, channeling all the strength I can into the head of the axe, although the muscles in my right arm are strained from amethyst pain. I don&apos;t care that the dark roots have already crawled my arm and up my shoulder. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;All I care is that this ends.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s like swinging at a rigid metal bar when it shields itself with its arms. The clang of that strike vibrates through my hands, echoing through the forest, and I hear the cheers of cadets in a lower train car, shouting my name, as they saw me moments earlier at Graduation.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp; Despite a story of height, the Vassal looks genuinely scared, but that doesn&apos;t stop it from dealing eviscerating blows. Drawn back by the momentum of the large axe, I stagger backwards, taking the wooden shaft in both my hands to block.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It makes sounds as if trying to speak, surely insulting me and my pettiness.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I dive to the side when the serrated edge slashes down on me. Dirt and snow erupt from the ground like lakewater splashing from a falling boulder. My vision is consumed by powder, but I charge forward anyways, channeling all that fury into another swing at nothing.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m lucky when it connects. The great Chymaeran is furious now, as if it wasn&apos;t before, but it still refuses to use all its strength. Probably to put on a show of little effort for its handlers, I think, before its first connecting swing shatters the butt of the axe, nearly whacking me off my feet.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra holds back Sylvia, insisting that I&apos;m &quot;already lost and beyond saving.&quot; I can feel the crack propagate when I strike again: the wooden shaft has hardly any metal left to hold on to. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My strike deals just as much damage as it did before. Absolutely nothing. Maybe a scratch, more just an annoyance, but my mission isn&apos;t to win.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The attack I&apos;ve waited for comes after my hands strain from all hard metal contact. I reach, weakly, to block with the wooden throat of the axe, but the force behind the Chymaeran&apos;s blade shatters it like a toothpick. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m surprised, but not by its raw power. With such force, its downward strike never even reaches the ground. I look down at my chest: a large crimson line traces from my left shoulder to my right hip. I grasp my chest, expecting my insides to spill, but I&apos;m surprised when the wound is only skin deep. My father always taught me to swing through your target, not just to make contact, and with all the bisected torsos of cadets in the train car I can see now, it&apos;s undeniable. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Vassal is pulling punches.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My fight is over as soon as I fall to my back, and the great obsidian beast stands over me. I don&apos;t have the stamina to flinch when one of the sharp edges of its arms stabs into the shoulder of my bad arm, pinning me against the ground. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I expect it could dice me to shreds like all those other cadets, but all I can see is the pain of this creature. It trembles with an unsettling fear for something so large, as if it tries to speak again. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can&apos;t move. All I can feel is the amethyst probing further into my blood. The pain subsides as my nerves no longer feel the cold of the wasteland. My arms and legs no longer hinge. My muscles refuse to budge as my breaths grow shallower, and I realize the vassal has granted me a merciful death.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I have taken in my surroundings: where the Royal Guards are and where they wait. Now that I know the purpose of this train, we will escape long before it halts, that is &mdash; if the thread can take me back far enough.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;It takes several seconds before I can lift myself from the hay bales in the corner of the train car. The rhythm of the carriage returns beneath me, and when the pain of the slash across my chest comes back, I contemplate how unlucky I am to be alive.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What were you thinking?&quot; Sylvia asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I just wanted to save you all,&quot; I said, but they don&apos;t seem to accept my version of the truth. I repeat it. &quot;Someone had to do something. To protect all of you. I gave myself so you could live! So you can tell your people what you&apos;ve learned.&quot; But Sylvia and Lyra aren&apos;t grateful.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You weren&apos;t doing it to save us. I saw that look in your eyes,&quot; Lyra says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You were trying to kill yourself,&quot; Sylvia says. She tensions her fingers around my shirt, jolting me as I weakly sprawl against the hay bales. &quot;Why, why would you do that?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I could tell her it was the guilt from letting Romin and Valentina die, forcing them to be a sacrifice. But when Lyra saw my resolve in letting go, she knew I was resolute in my decision. They wouldn&apos;t understand. They can never understand. But I have to tell them something to get what I want, to get to that sacrifice I have to make, so that I can save everyone I love from being less than cattle to the Afterlife. If this life is so inconsequential, then why is it so hard?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Sylvia treads further on the subject I try so hard to avoid. &quot;What did you mean when you said those words, that &apos;you can&apos;t throw away eternal life?&apos;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I can return. Over and over and over. If I die, I can go back and change the outcome,&quot; I say. &quot;So if I die in the process of protecting you, then it doesn&apos;t matter.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Doesn&apos;t matter? All you&apos;re doing is just throwing yourself away,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;You&apos;re not a tool or a means to an end, you&apos;re a person!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m cursed with the knowledge of how everything will end. You can&apos;t even begin to understand what I carry with me when I&apos;m responsible for everything!&quot; I turn to Lyra. &quot;You came to Blackwater to seek Fletcher after the column of light erupted in the sky. Ten years ago he died saving your life. I told you the trade building would be destroyed, and I wasn&apos;t lying, because I witnessed it the last time, and I did absolutely nothing because I was too afraid. And even the second time around, I still let all those innocent children die.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then why did you leave our friends to die without a moment of regret,&quot; Sylvia says, &quot;flipping the hatch of the basement door and deciding for all of us if we would try to save them?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because I did try,&quot; I tell her. &quot;I lived the same ten minute period over and over, for days and days and days until it broke every part of me that still wanted to hope. How could I come up with something so crafty in so little time? Do you know how many things I tried?&quot; My voice begins to waver but I don&apos;t care. &quot;I held back Romin. I reached to drag Valentina. I ran out the door with them, only to be shot like a stray dog. I tried every combination of words that might ever convince them, but it was as if fate, not our friends, had polarized them on that decision. So I had to say goodbye to them. I had, and have, to be absolute in my decision&mdash;without hesitation&mdash;or else you and I will never get to see them again.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It doesn&apos;t matter whether they fully believe me. These people are just figments of a past that will soon be forgotten. All I care about is the Essence Lyra promised for joining the First Red beyond the walls, and I have to believe that is still an option.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I turn to Lyra. &quot;I have no idea what they plan to do with the thousands of cadets they&apos;re sending beyond the walls. But I know that the great black tar of Endogeny is soon to liquidate the city of all Essence: every woman, child, and man whose generations of life were only lived to be culled like cattle. Three months from now, when Endogeny runs its full course, the Heiress of Purgatory will accept the blessing of the Gods, becoming the first cross-blood Chosen. And not a single life will be spared when all is covered in ash and lava.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;All my choices have been played out, and the longer this cycle drags me, the further I stretch away from a chance of that idyllic future.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp; Sylvia looks at my bare arm and notices something is missing.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s gone,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s gone?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Chymaeran curse, it&apos;s gone!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I look in disbelief. People always notice when pain arrives, but not when it subsides. My arm still holds the threaded slashes from all the cycles. But the scar from Ellie&apos;s room no longer saturates my flesh in a deep-purple trail. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;All that remains is just the faint line where the flesh was severed.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve never seen a weakblood make a full recovery,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;How can that be possible?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I remember the Vassal&apos;s edge that stabbed me to the ground. I couldn&apos;t feel anything after the strike. All I remember was the creature&apos;s reluctance to leave, probably desiring to return for me later when I&apos;m at full strength, when I could give it a fair fight.</p>",

Maybe it was the grief, how much he held it inside, but he&apos;d have these sudden panic attacks, prompted by nothing at all.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The only thing my father and I have in common is how much we hate him,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;After the Snowdrifters attacked our home, he refused to ever see Everett again. Everett fled to the city. Now we know he changed his last name over guilt, wishing to forget what he allowed to happen. And my father took me to the Afterlife, where as purebloods, we were welcomed with open arms.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Afterlife has anything you could want. How did you end up here?&quot; I ask. &quot;What could ever possibly make you want to leave that life?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because of how my father began to change,&quot; she says. &quot;Because I hadn&apos;t spent my whole life there. It wasn&apos;t normal to me. And all those desperate people I saw living on the edge of the walls, that day we made for the central peaks&mdash;the sick feeling of guilt never left me. Gods, I wonder how many of those purebloods have even seen the people whose necks they step on.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What happened to Ullrich?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Ever since the day he left us in the care of our uncle and aunt to visit the Afterlife, his personality changed. It changed before his feet even reached the porch. It looked as if he aged a hundred years, though his flesh showed no new wrinkles. And these episodes. Maybe it was the grief, how much he held it inside, but he&apos;d have these sudden panic attacks, prompted by nothing at all. And after every single one, his soul would age further, until one day it was as if he had nothing left.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She heaves for breath. Somewhere behind, Sylvia and the two Chymaerans trail us.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And when did you leave?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I left at the age of seventeen,&quot;she said. &quot;Ullrich wasn&apos;t even looking after me anymore, so obsessed with his role as Grandmaster General that I&apos;m sure he didn&apos;t even notice. It was so strange, though . . . you know that expression when you&apos;re reeling up to take a punch, when you harden your muscles and hold your breath? It&apos;s the only expression he wore for the last three months I was with him.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;He was afraid,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But of what? There&apos;s nothing out there. Most of the Chymaera around here are either allied to the First Red or living silently as refugees, taking the guise of the recently passed. That extremist image is more-so an invention of the Afterlife.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I check the tension of my own muscles, hardened much the same way, but not because of the cold. My back and neck haven&apos;t ached this bad since the hardest quarters of the Academy, and not even the trials of combat have strained them this far. An image haunts me just like Ullrich. She drags behind me in person and mind: the curtain call of failure, and I can feel entropy and fate draw us closer.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;How do you gain Essence?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Huh?&quot; Lyra says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Essence. How can you get it? Is it only through taking another person&apos;s life?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Essence is in everything around us. It&apos;s in everything that is alive. Killing is the most efficient way: it&apos;s why our ancestors raged in wars against each other for power. But it can also be transferred &mdash; at nearly a hundredth of killing&apos;s efficiency,&quot; she says. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I peek behind me. The snowstorm obscures her form. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I need to get stronger.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The First Red will make you strong. You don&apos;t need Essence to have strength,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;It takes generations to build it. All we have now is generations of Essence built and taken by the lucky survivors of a long-past war.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And that&apos;s it?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No. You can also cultivate it. We kill and consume plants and animals every day. You can take advantage of nature &mdash; putting it in the mulch and feed of plants and livestock &mdash; but it&apos;s a lot slower.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not nature that causes that,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;The Afterlife would be a frostbitten wasteland if nature had its way. It means we&apos;re almost there.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She&apos;s right. Every hundred yards I feel my insulated clothes grow hotter, and after a while, the sheets of frost no longer crunch, reduced to slush. There&apos;s a clearing somewhere far past the trees, and with my eyes, I can  make out small strands of something sticking from the snowbanks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The frost grows shallower, giving way to another change I had only ever seen riding the Academy gondola to get closer to the Afterlife. The strands are cereal grasses, dry and yellow like vagrants&apos; teeth. Only half a day or so past that house Romin and I could barely reach, and the sight captivates me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Spoken-word stories tell us that this is what Blackwater looked like before the fall,&quot; Lyra says. She lifts her hands and falls to her knees, anticipating something neither Sylvia or I can see.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Their voices cry out, and I only begin to notice when I hear them. Their bodies refract the light with scales like polished, transparent glass. I blink them away at first as if they&apos;re just a smudge in my eye, but as they approach closer, I can see their footsteps: the only evidence ten of them leave behind.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We all drop to our knees, tossing our gear to the ground.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;State your business, or be executed where you stand,&quot; one calls out. &quot;There is no return from here.&quot;</p>",

His grave is only empty because of foxes and wolves.&quot; He turns to Sylvia and I. &quot;What&apos;s to say these aliens aren&apos;t Chymaerans from the Afterlife, that they didn&apos;t take some poor cadet&apos;s guise and wear their flesh?&quot; He eyes the necklace pendant my mother gave me.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin was just as stuck-up and arrogant as you are. He made his whole life mission to take up leadership in the First Red when you died. He lived in the shadow of you and his brother Ryder, always asking himself if his efforts and achievements were enough,&quot; I say.</p>",

But then you told him it was a metaphor. That keeping it sharp was a symbol of renewed honor, and just that word changed his mind completely.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I remember, too,&quot; I say. &quot;And the next day, he found the sword you planned to give him as a gift. Early in the lighttime, he took it to the Compound&apos;s shop. You probably awoke to the loud screeching of metal and panicked Carmine trying to stop the husky kid from taking over the edge grinder. He was ruining the perfect edge of the blade, saying it would bring him more honor.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So please. We don&apos;t plan to leave, but to stay forever and contribute to this village. Our mission is yours: to save Blackwater in any way we can.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Raine turns to the other Chieftains. &quot;Everything they&apos;ve said is true, and it checks out,&quot; he says. &quot;Even the best-trained Chymaeran couldn&apos;t dig those details out of a guise.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;If the worst case is that someone tailed them, we&apos;ll be handling that anyway, regardless of what we decide.&quot; He speaks louder so we can overtly hear. &quot;If they try to escape without fear, they&apos;ll die as frosthards. And if they breach our trust, we&apos;ll put them out the same way we intended to.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We do,&quot; Sylvia says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then from this moment on, the Committee of the Twelve recognizes you as provisional trainees to the Carmine,&quot; Raine says. &quot;As in, you must earn our trust and respect. If you fall in any breach of that&mdash;and I mean anything&mdash;your title, and life, will be subject to termination.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Understood,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;As pledges from District Twelve, I will oversee your education.&quot; He gestures to a chieftain with gray braids beside him. &quot;The ninth chieftain, Lorne, will see to your housing in the barracks.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Thank you for your clemency,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This will be the furthest from a life of leisure, Titus and Sylvia. The life of the furthest edgelander in Blackwater, nearest to the frigid walls of the outer lands, pales in comparison to the demand of every Backwood villager, and yours will be especially heavy.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We understand,&quot; Sylvia says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then welcome to the land of the true Carmine,&quot; Raine says. His extension of provisional trust is admirable, and though Sylvia seems contented with the freedom of a new life, I can only think of the past and everything I owe to the ones I allowed to die.</p>",

But for those with some Chymaeran blood &mdash; the rare ones split between both sides of life and death as a living paradox &mdash; they live the lives of many, providing the First Red the intel they need by borrowing the likeness of long-forgotten dead.</p>",

Romin is the same statuesque boulder. This forbidden comfort is a catharsis I can&apos;t yet afford. Gods. This touch is a drug, but all I huff now are the fumes of the secondhand past that still follows me, and the more I stay, the less I want to let go.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;A group of half-blood Chymaerans approach, two of them still wearing the faces of Romin and Valentina. From Valentina&apos;s hand dangles my necklace. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Their voices transition from vibrating clicks to human speech. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You never answered at the Cheiftains&apos; Lodge. Why do you have an identity marker?&quot; the Romin asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I never knew it was,&quot; I say. It&apos;s so strange addressing Romin when his mannerisms are entirely different. But I can see a notable change compared to when they first wore his face.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Can I borrow this?&quot; He asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A part of me is reassured they found it. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You can have it. I don&apos;t need it or want it,&quot; I say. All I carry with me now is memory, not possessions. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But I&apos;m still curious. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Why do you want to borrow it?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I think I know the Chymaeran half-blood that used this. They mentioned they&apos;ve been missing one for a long time.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; I say. I always considered its origin was somewhere beyond the walls, taken by Snowdrifters before I ever became one. None of those things ever get back to their original owner, because every run we&apos;re stealing from the dead.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The dead deserve respect for us to borrow their lives. It&apos;s sacred to the culture of true Chymaerans,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;To lose a guise is to lose an intimate connection &mdash; there&apos;s a lot I&apos;ve learned about this girl while I guised her.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Like what?&quot; says Sylvia. She no longer basks in the comfort of the fields.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;When you start, it&apos;s as if you forget everything about who you really are. You have to remember that it&apos;s all just an appearance, just to separate yourself. It&apos;s brutal to remember a person&apos;s last traumas. The most recent memories come first, and so for this girl . . . &quot; Valentina says. Her words trail off, waiting for someone to pick them up.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Sylvia asks, &quot;Was it painless?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;She was gone before she could think about it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh.&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I turn to the Chymaeran guising Romin, but before I can ask the same question, they turn away. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I ask anyway.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;They respond, &quot;You don&apos;t want to know. It wasn&apos;t quick.&quot; They leave it at that. I don&apos;t ask further, knowing it might upset Sylvia.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Tell us,&quot; Sylvia insists. &quot;I want to know.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin was shot several times, but it wasn&apos;t the bullets that killed him. His last thoughts were regrets.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I think of his last words in my first life, pleading to the empty air for someone to remember him.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But why, why would he do that?&quot; Sylvia says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because I wanted the perfect reason to die,&quot; Romin says, before correcting himself. &quot;Because he wanted . . . Gods above. Six hours and it feels like I&apos;m already becoming him.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Sylvia asks, &quot;How much can half-blood Chymaerans remember in a week? A month? Even years?&quot; And I can tell where she&apos;s going with this.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Longer than the person was alive, to achieve a fraction of their memories and personality,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;Most recent memories first, except for their most painful traumas.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I see,&quot; Sylvia says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I felt the oddest comfort when I got over the initial surprise of seeing the two Chymaerans guising my cherished friends. But once they opened their mouths to speak and their joints postured in a body language I couldn&apos;t recognize, there&apos;s been a sickening uncanniness I can&apos;t shake.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The look of hope in Sylvia&apos;s eyes tells me she&apos;s on the edge of falling victim to this convincing illusion. To her, it&apos;s a chance to start over, but in reality it&apos;s the furthest thing from benign.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Romin says, &quot;You&apos;ll be paired with us in the living halls since we&apos;ll be training you&mdash;since so much of all our lives were spent in District Twelve.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s great!&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;And you&apos;ll be keeping this appearance?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;If you wish,&quot; the Romin responds. I know it&apos;s hard to resist looks this good, I hear in my mind, but his face is stoic.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Oh, shut up Romin! You&apos;re the last ugly face I&apos;d want to wake up to. I crack a smile when I imagine Valentina&apos;s response, but she&apos;s dead-serious too.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s an important meeting tonight held by the leaders of the First Red. You&apos;ll be introduced there. Gods above &mdash; there have been so many reports of you two as spies, it&apos;ll do us well to clear all of this up. Come to the North wall at sundown,&quot; Valentina says.</p>",
        "Romin spits out several parting words before they dissolve to clicks. &quot;We&apos;ll see you there. And enjoy your last day of freedom&mdash;there&apos;s a lot to catch you up on tomorrow.&quot;"

        "<p>&emsp;I find that like it. Unlike the hedonistic civilians that indulge themselves behind their tall cobblestone walls, these villagers directly face that boundless, all-consuming darkness every night, reminding them of all they could lose at a moment&apos;s notice.

He stands beside a great sled on the edge of the village as the darkness sets into the forest, talking with two tall hooded figures. Looking at their feet, I consider they have the strangest shoes, as if they stand on tall heels only exposing the lowest part of their toes, but the detail eludes me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We have some time before the meeting. I wanted to talk with you for a while.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; I offer, joining their conversation circle as they part to let me in. But my attention is fixed on the strange creatures my eyes can&apos;t reconcile, the slight hunching, looking as if dogs stand upright at full attention. Their eyes are piercing and slitted.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m impressed,&quot; Raine says. &quot;How do you even know that?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;My grandfather hoarded illicit books of the old world. He insisted they weren&apos;t fairy tales, though everything that the Academy and Seminary taught us would say otherwise.&quot; I turn to them in disbelief, as if all pen-and-ink illustrations of my memory were given slender legs and angular faces. &quot;How did you even make it here? Where do you come from?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;They motion to the sled, outfitted like a touring car with flat skis instead of wheels. &quot;Explorers, we are. From Melenia. Sent by Ja&apos;ada. This is the only northern village we can travel. Well-known by other lands. Supported by us. Cause is noble.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;As we&apos;re the last Humans alive. Surely,&quot; I say. They laugh to themselves, muttering something in their own sharp-tongued language.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Walk with me,&quot; Raine says. &quot;Where&apos;s the other girl?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Still exploring. I didn&apos;t mean to leave her hanging, but I wanted to return to the barracks,&quot; I say. &quot;What do you need?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;First is an Essence transfer. I also want to give you a quick personal tour,&quot; Raine says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Thank you for your time, sir,&quot; I say, but I can tell the gnawing anticipation to learn his son&apos;s past would consume him if he didn&apos;t approach me eventually.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Call me Raine,&quot; he says. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We wave to the Ahkvasans, still chattering on and laughing in their quick tongue. He stops for a moment and turns to face me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I would have done this if you both were here. But you need some Essence to be helpful out here,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You can transfer Essence?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It takes a lot to give a little. But when the elders die, they allow us to reclaim it all in their passing. Circle of life, or something like that, right?&quot; Raine says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So you kill them first?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He laughs. &quot;No. Gods no, absolutely not. But when they die, there&apos;s a brief period that the Essence vacates their circuits. It shimmers in the air, faintly, like crystals of snow, so clear you almost can&apos;t see it, attracted to the nearest circuit-wielder like metal dust to a magnet. But if too much time passes, it condenses to dead Essence, falling to the ground where it&apos;s absorbed into the dirt.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I recall the great liquidation of Blackwater, the moment when Essence flooded through the cavern from all the victims of Endogeny. The flood of power I felt in my circuits, though only a hundredth of a hundredth of that great plume found me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve never witnessed that before,&quot; I tell him.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I hope not,&quot; he says, laughing again. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He exposes his hand. Near the bones on both sides of his wrist, I see two series of slashes that have worn there many times before. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Are you ready? This won&apos;t hurt too much, I promise,&quot; he insists.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Go ahead,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He withdraws a dagger. It glows hot like the can of beans did in Lyra&apos;s hand, cleansing the blade of any impurities. &quot;We need to air our blood for the transfer to happen. Hold my forearm. Line our wrists at the joint.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We hold each other&apos;s arms like a deep handshake. He slices the blade across both of our wrists at the side. The pain is quick. A small trickle of blood pools together at the crease of our light and dark flesh. By gravity, none of it returns to the slice to cross-contaminate, but I can see the faintest glow rise between us. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Raine draws into his pocket with another hand, retrieving dead Essence, and he sprinkles it on the union of our blood. It stings of a familiar otherworldly force when it absorbs into the lesion. When the blood dries, he twists his wrist so that mine is on top, and an immense feeling of flux envelops me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Chieftains hold all the Essence of the dead so that it can be distributed efficiently,&quot; he says. &quot;But imagine this: even with all this Essence flooded in each of our circuits from the fallen, we don&apos;t even reach a tenth of what the average pureblood of the Afterlife has.&quot; His face is stoic again. &quot;Honor their sacrifice. Return to the graves of the deceased whose Essence you took to honor them. Somewhere in the reservoir, your words will reach them, and maybe, just maybe, it will guide them back to us in another life.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I will,&quot; I tell him. The feeling is electric. But it&apos;s nothing close to the magnitude of what I had in the Afterlife.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Soon you&apos;ll even be able to do this. Watch,&quot; he says. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He turns his palm upward. His fingers glow like flesh pressed directly up to a flashlight, and in moments, a spark attenuates into a flame.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He finds joy in my expression of disbelief. &quot;You remind me of my son Ryder, the first time I showed him in the basement of the Compound. He pleaded for me to teach him, but I had to swear him to secrecy,&quot; Raine says. &quot;I never got the chance to show Romin.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sure he would have been amazed,&quot; I tell him. &quot;It&apos;s our birthright as Humans. It&apos;s what we deserve.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Damn right,&quot; he says. &quot;Speaking of that, how does the Essence feel? It must be a strange new sensation to you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It feels nice. I won&apos;t freeze when sleeping at night anymore, I can tell you that,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Good,&quot; Raine says. He motions for me to follow him. &quot;Look&mdash;I&apos;m sorry how we reacted to your arrival. You have to understand how scared we were, how thin the ice is we tread on secrecy. You know why I left Blackwater?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I shake my head.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The First Red Chieftains phase through life terms. When one dies, another replaces them. It&apos;s a rare occurrence &mdash; you probably don&apos;t know how much a solid base of Essence prolongs the Human life &mdash; but when a chair is empty, they draw directly from the highest member of that Blackwater district.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It happened when Romin was three or so, I think I remember from what he told me,&quot; I say. &quot;You didn&apos;t have a choice, did you?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Carmine pledge leaves no room to waver in uncertainty. You give all of yourself, everything that&apos;s asked of you. And the most taxing is time.&quot; He looks down at his weathered, cracked hands as we walk. &quot;I gave up a relationship with my sons. I had to die to them. They had everything in place to convincingly frame it, and it doesn&apos;t take much to convince the Merlot and the Afterlife&mdash;they were probably relieved,&quot; he says. &quot;My whole life here has been trying to make up for that. And I want you to know that, although this life will be hard, you will be safe and protected, well-taken-care-of and challenged.&quot; The words sound like they&apos;ve been rehearsed in his mind for ages, for someone he knew he&apos;d never meet.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;ll honor whatever you need from me, Raine,&quot; I tell him.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Raine introduces me to half the village, and to any curious passerby that stares me down like how I glared at the Ahkvasans. He shows me the grueling labor of the farmers, able to harvest fully-grown plants in a mere two weeks by cheating the ecosystem with Essence. He shows the few young Carmine much like myself, strong with corded muscle much like Romin, enthusiastic to find another friend their age. And finally, we arrive to the Chieftains&apos; Lodge, where he takes me inside.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And this building here is the heart of all the Carmine, all we&apos;ve ever fought for. It&apos;s nothing compared to the great compounds we&apos;ve erected all around Blackwater proper, of course: all we have out here is logs instead of concrete. But this is the nexus from which all decisions spring, influencing the Carmine in Blackwater though ninety-nine-point-nine percent of their ranks don&apos;t even know we exist.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;In the center of the floor is the shimmering fragment of something in a case. Now that enough Essence floods my circuits, I can sense it, and Raine notices.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;A fragment of Pure Essence,&quot; he says. &quot;Legends say the Pure Essence comes straight from the Gods, before they banished themselves from this world and all its affairs.&quot; His eyes look beyond the windows for something, and then he tugs my shirt, bringing me to the window. &quot;You see that boulder out there? That one, by the tree.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What about it?&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s about knee-height in diameter.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They say that&apos;s how much of this Pure Essence exists in the world. So much unaccounted for, so much we don&apos;t even know about, so much even locked away for safety, for mutually-assured destruction, hopefully never to be touched. It&apos;s the only fine connection we still have to the divine.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And it&apos;s the source of the climate,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Smart,&quot; Raine says. &quot;A great part of it. Any more and we&apos;d stick out to the Afterlife. We have just enough to remain hidden in this endless snowstorm, the best cover we could ever ask for.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A Sister approaches from behind us, excusing her interruption before tapping me on the shoulder. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This is yours, right?&quot; In her hand dangles the black, crystalline identity marker, suspended from a fixed clasp after Raine tore it from me. &quot;The Chymaeran-blooded brothers were excited for some reason after they asked to borrow it. These things are speculated about like treasures to Snowdrifters. It&apos;s part of their culture, I guess. But they gave up after they couldn&apos;t find whatever they were looking for.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Chymaerans are strange creatures,&quot; Raine says. &quot;But then again, I guess we&apos;re strange to them, too.&quot;</p>",
        " I tie the clasp back around my neck, and attuned more to the energies of the world around me, I feel the strangeness of its power as if a voice whispers in my mind."

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sure he would have been amazed,&quot; I tell him. &quot;It&apos;s our birthright as Humans. It&apos;s what we deserve.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Damn right,&quot; he says. &quot;Speaking of that, how does the Essence feel? It must be a strange new sensation to you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It feels nice. I won&apos;t freeze when sleeping at night anymore, I can tell you that,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Good,&quot; Raine says. He motions for me to follow him. &quot;Look&mdash;I&apos;m sorry how we reacted to your arrival. You have to understand how scared we were, how thin the ice is we tread on secrecy. You know why I left Blackwater?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I shake my head.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The First Red Chieftains phase through life terms. When one dies, another replaces them. It&apos;s a rare occurrence &mdash; you probably don&apos;t know how much a solid base of Essence prolongs the Human life &mdash; but when a chair is empty, they draw directly from the highest member of that Blackwater district.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It happened when Romin was three or so, I think I remember from what he told me,&quot; I say. &quot;You didn&apos;t have a choice, did you?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Carmine pledge leaves no room to waver in uncertainty. You give all of yourself, everything that&apos;s asked of you. And the most taxing is time.&quot; He looks down at his weathered, cracked hands as we walk. &quot;I gave up a relationship with my sons. I had to die to them. They had everything in place to convincingly frame it, and it doesn&apos;t take much to convince the Merlot and the Afterlife&mdash;they were probably relieved,&quot; he says. &quot;My whole life here has been trying to make up for that. And I want you to know that, although this life will be hard, you will be safe and protected, well-taken-care-of and challenged.&quot; The words sound like they&apos;ve been rehearsed in his mind for ages, for someone he knew he&apos;d never meet.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;ll honor whatever you need from me, Raine,&quot; I tell him.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Raine introduces me to half the village, and to any curious passerby that stares me down like how I glared at the Ahkvasans. He shows me the grueling labor of the farmers, able to harvest fully-grown plants in a mere two weeks by cheating the ecosystem with Essence. He shows the few young Carmine much like myself, strong with corded muscle much like Romin, enthusiastic to find another friend their age. And finally, we arrive to the Chieftains&apos; Lodge, where he takes me inside.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And this building here is the heart of all the Carmine, all we&apos;ve ever fought for. It&apos;s nothing compared to the great compounds we&apos;ve erected all around Blackwater proper, of course: all we have out here is logs instead of concrete. But this is the nexus from which all decisions spring, influencing the Carmine in Blackwater though ninety-nine-point-nine percent of their ranks don&apos;t even know we exist.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;In the center of the floor is the shimmering fragment of something in a case. Now that enough Essence floods my circuits, I can sense it, and Raine notices.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;A fragment of Pure Essence,&quot; he says. &quot;Legends say the Pure Essence comes straight from the Gods, before they banished themselves from this world and all its affairs.&quot; His eyes look beyond the windows for something, and then he tugs my shirt, bringing me to the window. &quot;You see that boulder out there? That one, by the tree.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What about it?&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s about knee-height in diameter.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They say that&apos;s how much of this Pure Essence exists in the world. So much unaccounted for, so much we don&apos;t even know about, so much even locked away for safety, for mutually-assured destruction, hopefully never to be touched. It&apos;s the only fine connection we still have to the divine.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And it&apos;s the source of the climate,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Smart,&quot; Raine says. &quot;A great part of it. Any more and we&apos;d stick out to the Afterlife. We have just enough to remain hidden in this endless snowstorm, the best cover we could ever ask for.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A Sister approaches from behind us, excusing her interruption before tapping me on the shoulder. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This is yours, right?&quot; In her hand dangles the black, crystalline identity marker, suspended from a fixed clasp after Raine tore it from me. &quot;The Chymaeran-blooded brothers were excited for some reason after they asked to borrow it. These things are speculated about like treasures to Snowdrifters. It&apos;s part of their culture, I guess. But they gave up after they couldn&apos;t find whatever they were looking for.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Chymaerans are strange creatures,&quot; Raine says. &quot;But then again, I guess we&apos;re strange to them, too.&quot;</p>",
        " I tie the clasp back around my neck, and attuned more to the energies of the world around me, I feel the strangeness of its power as if a voice whispers in my mind."

        "<p>&emsp;The gathering has already begun in the amphitheater by the time Raine and I arrive. The Chieftains of the First Red scatter about the front benches as salt-and-pepper heads of hair in a sea of crimson cloaks. Behind them, villagers fill the outcropping seated on grass, rocks, or fallen logs, and to the sides of us, limestone slabs scrape the sky above the trees. The two natural walls meet at the bottom, where an outcropping of rocks have been cobbled into a stage.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Raine motions for me to sit next to him on the rear benches near the central aisle. I look for Sylvia or Lyra, the only other two faces I know, but the ruffled hair, tattered clothes, and sultry skin of the villagers blend them all into the foliage.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;She milks suspense for every ounce she can get, but still comes up dry.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;A column of crimson light broke the sky,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;That means two things. First, that there was Pure Essence in some form. And second, that someone of the Chosen bloodline got their hands on it!&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Raine turns to me. &quot;Is this all really true?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Every word of it,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;With her argument crumbling to sand, Lyra fights to usher out her last argument before they silence her. &quot;And if that column of light erupted &mdash; and there was Pure Essence &mdash; then that means Fletcher is alive. It had to have been him!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Another audible groan from the audience.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No, think about it. Good Carmine brothers and sisters, there&apos;s no other possibility.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Impossible,&quot; I mutter: I lit that column of light. Telling them would only further confound the story and sully the waters. I&apos;m far too young to fit Lyra&apos;s theory, anyways.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I think we&apos;ve all heard quite enough of your . . . &apos;possibilities,&apos;&quot; Raine says. He stands beside me. &quot;Even if the Afterlife have a source of pure Essence, it&apos;s impossible that your brother is still alive.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra turns to the Secretary who proposed the seconding motion in the first place. I can feel her anger towards their reverence because it begins to annoy me, too. I was almost excited when Lyra spoke so passionately about the First Red, and I was astounded when I saw their valiant efforts to survive beyond the walls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ve been over this so many times already, Lyra. Your brother is dead. So it doesn&apos;t matter,&quot; Raine says. &quot;Actually, you know what? Permission to debate this topic with the other party?&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re gonna end this discussion so we never have to have it again,&quot; he insists, and I can tell this scratches a wound that healed a long time ago. His anger isn&apos;t annoyance anymore. &quot;Your brother doesn&apos;t matter. And even if the Purebloods have Pure Essence in their possession, that doesn&apos;t matter either!&quot; Raine says. &quot;What we need more than anything is patience and diligence. We need to prepare ourselves.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ve been prepared for years, Raine. When will it ever be enough? All of you out there have grown so complacent with your lives beyond the walls. You think the busywork you preoccupy yourself with, day in and day out, can even begin to atone for how afraid you are of the real reason you&apos;re here. You hide from it. You use the excuse of your sacrifice to ignore the reason you gave up that life in the first place.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s a difference between giving up and having the patience to wait,&quot; Raine says. &quot;Every day I remember the ones I left behind. My late wife wept for months, grieving the children that died to her, and so many of us have faced the same, so don&apos;t tell us we&apos;ve forgotten our purpose! Unlike you, we don&apos;t have a reason to hate the life we left behind. And we anticipate, not fear, the day we get to return.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then what perfect moment are you waiting for? And if you are waiting, how do you know it hasn&apos;t already passed?&quot; Lyra asks. &quot;We are ready. We have everything we could possibly need.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re not ready, Lyra. And maybe you&apos;ve forgotten the strength of the power they have. One of their weakest civilians has the Essence of three of our strongest men!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But the Weakbloods are the ones that give them their true power,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;Its not about the Essence. It&apos;s resources. And our connections tap into every single corner of Blackwater.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;If only they knew what was really going on. They wouldn&apos;t believe the words from me, an outsider to all the Carmine, and it frustrates me the more I watch Lyra drown in her ambitions.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But their debate ends when a Carmine messenger flies down the stairs from the upper entrance: a gold-sealed letter in hand that shimmers in the light. </p>",
        "The Secretary nearly jumps out of his chair. Lyra and Raine look on with newfound horror."

Red are for monthly reports: each division receives twelve. Silver are for important, urgent developments, and they&apos;re only allowed one per year. But gold . . . are only to be used once, for emergencies that threaten the life of everyone in Blackwater.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The Secretary says, &quot;Only one district, Brothers and Sisters. We saw riots like these back in the 73rd year of Blackwater, no need for panic.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The message ends, but the messenger still isn&apos;t done. His hand draws into his pockets, pulling out a handful of envelopes.  The crowd gasps. He fans them out. My eyes can&apos;t count from such a far distance, but even more golden labels reflect under the sun as he raises the next.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;District two. Twelve hours ago. &apos;Merlot attacked and burned five Carmine safe houses. Thirty-four dead or missing. Merlot claim they are not behind the attacks.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This matter will be tabled until next meeting,&quot; the Secretary says. His voice wavers, and for a man of such power to crumple, I know exactly what truth awaits. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He wets his tongue before it dries like parchment. &quot;As you all know, the highest Carmine in Blackwater are given seals for correspondences beyond the walls. Red are for monthly reports: each division receives twelve. Silver are for important, urgent developments, and they&apos;re only allowed one per year. But gold . . . are only to be used once, for emergencies that threaten the life of everyone in Blackwater.&quot;</p>",

Massive ground war between Merlot and Carmine. Street riots in Merlot district have destroyed commercial and residential property.&apos; End of message.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The message ends, but the messenger still isn&apos;t done. His hand draws into his pockets, pulling out a handful of envelopes.  The crowd gasps. He fans them out. My eyes can&apos;t count from such a far distance, but even more golden labels reflect under the sun as he raises the next.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;District two. Twelve hours ago. &apos;Merlot attacked and burned five Carmine safe houses. Thirty-four dead or missing. Merlot claim they are not behind the attacks. Massive infighting on streets. Carmine and Carmine-allied civilians actively destroying Merlot property, regardless of orders to stop.&apos; End of message.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Raine says, &quot;That doesn&apos;t directly mean it&apos;s time for us to go. There have been great clashes before, but that doesn&apos;t mean the Purebloods are any weaker: in fact, it means they&apos;re stronger, now that our brothers and sisters toil with the Merlot!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But they weren&apos;t the Merlot,&quot; Lyra insists.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And how would you know that?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because the Afterlife was disguised as the Merlot when they attacked us both times,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;They were sewing the seeds of discord between the Merlot and the Carmine for their own gain!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Afterlife,&quot; Raine says. &quot;If we&apos;re fighting them, then we need more time to build our strength and plan our tactics.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Screw tactics: we&apos;ve been strategizing for years. There is no perfect time. That&apos;s just an excuse to bury our heads in the snow and still keep our honor!&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Alright, then. Do what&apos;s right. Remember what we&apos;re here for,&quot; Lyra demands, &quot;we have to put actions to the purpose that gives us pride.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A silence awaits the vote.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This congregation will now cast the vote of return to Blackwater. A &apos;aye&apos; vote sets in motion the return protocol. A &apos;nay&apos; vote withholds our return.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;How many votes &apos;aye?&apos;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Aye!&quot; I stand. There are few young Brothers and Sisters in the audience who join me. A couple others quietly mutter from the audience, but still remain seated in the grass. Raine is silent, and with him, the rest bow their heads.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;As they count the votes, I turn around, only to find that Sylvia cowers with them. Lyra stands there with her hand stretched in the air, trying to coerce her, but even in a losing fight, she still refuses.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Raine and the Secretary almost look relieved. &quot;Alright. And how many votes &apos;nay?&apos;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The response starts quiet, but grows louder as more voices join: their weakness in numbers, and I see Lyra&apos;s disappointed anger crescendo.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Vote has been called. The &apos;nays&apos; have&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You spineless cowards, have you lost your edge? Your own people are dying and all you do is watch!&quot; Lyra says.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Do the Carmine of Blackwater who are dying under the thumb of the Purebloods get a vote? Or is it only the purposeless pricks beyond the wall that get to decide?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ve heard enough, Lyra!&quot; says the Secretary.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Chymaeran surveillance in all twelve districts. First Red Carmine, ready in a matter of hours, to press towards whatever target we set. And so many Carmine districts waiting, just waiting, for the prophecy of the First Red to come to them, to tell them it&apos;s time for the final fight.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Get her out of here, someone,&quot; the Secretary demands, and several eagerly jump to his aid.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They have all the protocols we&apos;ve written, and all we need to do is send a single letter. I&apos;m tired of waiting, thinking any of you are going to change when you&apos;re just cowards, obsessed with a dream of purpose you&apos;ll never &mdash; get your hands off me!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Raine can sense I&apos;m dissatisfied: I stood right beside him, after all. &quot;Why didn&apos;t it pass?&quot; I ask. &quot;This is the time all of you have been waiting for, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He draws a tender look before answering, like a father lecturing his misguided son. &quot;I&apos;m sure you know this by now, but there are very few young Brothers and Sisters beyond the walls. Most of them look to Lyra as the image that represents them. But they&apos;re too young to understand what it means to have something to lose,&quot; he explains.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But isn&apos;t sacrifice the very premise of what you&apos;ve sworn to protect?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Sacrifice can only be useful if it&apos;s used wisely, Titus,&quot; he says, but his explanation only disappoints and frustrates me further.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;If only they could be reminded of the people they left. The sentimental value of their lives when it&apos;s not degraded to a distant anecdote.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Where&apos;s the other girl you came here with?&quot; He says, just as bad at remembering girls&apos; names as his son. &quot;Now that the two of you are together, we can finish your orientation.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We&apos;re not quite on speaking terms after our last fight, but I scan for her anyways. I wave to her and she approaches.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We need to finish orientation,&quot; I say.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Same,&quot; Raine tells her. &quot;And in time, I know your friend here will come to appreciate what we&apos;ve built, and how he can contribute.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She tries to meet my eyes to confirm Raine&apos;s rationale, to say she&apos;s right and I&apos;m wrong. If only any of them could understand what they&apos;ve abandoned; how much they&apos;ll regret their dithering when they see everyone is dead. But this is their world, and it will never be mine.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Raine says. I realize he&apos;s already transferring Essence, the same way he did with me. &quot;It&apos;s an amazing feeling. But don&apos;t let it scare you, Sylvia, or can be a lot the first time.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She closes her eyes, trying to release the tension she draws to resist the pain.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Go ahead,&quot; she says.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s the door sliding open on its track. And over the cries and shrieks of panic-stricken prisoners, nobody noticed the train reached the end of the line.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We can rush them,&quot; Jarrett says: words I&apos;ve heard before, words that can only bring the same result of thoughtless bloodshed. &quot;Listen. We&apos;re third-class Cadets, and you have our strength. They can&apos;t stop all of us!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;His optimism infuriates me. I envy that tactless, stupid hope they find when they&apos;re all going to die no matter what. But I don&apos;t have to speak on it. Like the First Red, they&apos;re all cowards with only enough headspace to consider themselves.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Listen! We can&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A voice feathers from static. &quot;And where are you going to go, you stupid Carmine sap?&quot; </p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re getting out of here,&quot;Jarrett insists.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;All talk and no brains. No wonder the First Red were all blown out of their foxholes,&quot; the Chymaeran says, though Jarrett doesn&apos;t even know what the First Red are. &quot;You&apos;ll all turn to Frosthards in the first ten seconds. We&apos;ll reap your Essence anyway!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Reap our Essence?&quot; Vera asks.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The Cadets are petrified: unsure of whether they wish to let the floor swallow them or try to run with Jarrett. Either is suicide.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This isn&apos;t just a prison. You are not being punished for anything. You are only fulfilling your purpose, and I&apos;m giving you an opportunity,&quot; he says, and down the line of cars, I hear other guards give the same spiel to their unwitting participants. &quot;In the scale of this world&apos;s future, your purpose is vital: each and every one of you. You afford this world another chance at the Golden Age that was torn from us. And so you will be given a chance to choose your fate.&quot; </p>",

        "<p>&emsp;I forgot what it felt like to see a Chymaeran for the first time. Some cadets jump with fright, while most are so emotionally raw they stare with unblinking desperation. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Chymaeran asks the most frightened one in front of them first.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What are you?&quot; The Chymaeran asks her.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Answer! All your fellow Cadets will freeze if we don&apos;t get through you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Weak,&quot; she answers. &quot;I am weak.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Go ahead,&quot; he says. He motions for them to pass him, and they get off just fine. Several gasp in disbelief. They thought it would be much worse.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And you?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The next one is another woman, younger with red hair and freckles. She looks past the Chymaeran at the other woman and her kids. Some look of reassurance crosses her face after a few seconds. She looks down at her meager Garnet-level mark before answering. &quot;I am weak,&quot; she replies, bashful.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then go,&quot; says the Chymaeran.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Another Cadet steps up, a young man this time. Some guy I met once in passing, enough a sense of pride that shines far beyond his actual level.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I think I am . . . strong,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Chymaeran sneers again.  &quot;You think?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I am,&quot; he insists.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then step aside.&quot; He tries to exit, misunderstanding them. &quot;No! Aside the cabin. Right here,&quot; he says, motioning to the front wall before turning to the next one. &quot;And you? What are you?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can tell it&apos;s his fireteammate from the way they look at each other. Did they let these people group themselves onto the trains intentionally? Before they knew where they were headed?</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The confident guy nods. His friend speaks up.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m strong, too.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then face each other,&quot; the Chymaeran says, throwing something on the ground to each of them. &quot;Pick it up. Now!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And they do. I watch the terror settle in their eyes when they regret speaking those words.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then prove it.&quot; He says. &quot;You have one minute to decide who&apos;s the real Champion.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You mean&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Now.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The courageous one pleads. &quot;Victor,&quot; he says, as his voice trembles. How quickly he folds on himself, and his friend does, too, once they realize there&apos;s no way out. They circle each other, idling time. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I can&apos;t do this. I can&apos;t! I&apos;ve known you since Seminary,&quot; the first says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We have to, Gage, come on! Come at me,&quot; Victor lunges with a hollow slash that couldn&apos;t cut a dandelion.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No, no, no,&quot; Gage says, his eyes shifting between the impatient Chymaeran and his friend. Victor takes a further slice as Gage idles, flaying the skin of his arm, but he hesitates as soon as he realizes what he&apos;s done.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Gage screams with pain. He looks down at the slice as he drops his knife, and Victor panics, holding his hands to his ears and sobbing while the knife is still on his hands.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Victor says, &quot;I hardly even cut you! I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m sorry, please,&quot; he repeats, over and over, &quot;I didn&apos;t mean to,&quot; before the knife slips from his fingers, stabbing into the wooden slats.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I recognize it in an instant. Gage shudders on the ground, and it&apos;s tough to make out in the shadows, but the faintest amethyst glow encapsulates his entire body.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We learned it took too long to make you skin each other alive,&quot; the Chymaeran explains. Moments later, Gage&apos;s breathing stops when he melts into the floor. The hard parts of him become amorphous. And then, when the Amethyst absorbs him completely, leaving nothing but the Garnet-class cloak, the spectators gasp when a small trail of Essence gusts from Gage into Victor.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This is how this world really works, shitbloods,&quot; the Chymaeran says. &quot;Victor here learned something today. And I hope you all can learn through him, too!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Victor still trembles. But all of a sudden he tenses, clutching his chest. In the darkness, the Chymaeran&apos;s slender arm reaches behind him, and in moments, the same Amethyst leaks like living ink down his limbs from beneath his cloak.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Gage&apos;s knife clatters to the ground.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ll learn that we don&apos;t tolerate hesitation,&quot; the Chymaeran says, &quot;if you consider yourself a Champion, if you think you can equate yourselves with us.&quot; The crowd stirs in panic. They were raised as slaves, and now they&apos;ll die as them in whatever fate awaits the reluctant. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I startle Vera when I rise to my feet. &quot;And how free will these winners be?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You will join the Afterlife in its mission. This is the way we&apos;ve recruited the few remaining spaces every time, every passing class. Haven&apos;t you wondered what happened to all those lower-ranked losers that died in &apos;service&apos; beyond the walls?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But why do we deserve this?&quot; Another asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because this is what you signed up for!&quot; the Chymaeran says. &quot;You got a meal plan, lodging, your families taken care of with a stipend for your training. You knew this risk would come the day you signed on to the Academy. You knew the class-system and you chose to play the game, and now that the trade-off for all you&apos;ve leeched from us is here, you will fulfill your true value!&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They said it was desertion,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;We didn&apos;t go to the upper lands to defend against the &apos;Carmine,&apos; because we were looking for someone.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;How unfortunate,&quot; the Chymaeran says. &quot;You see, now, lowly Cadets, these Dragon-Class fighters have real strength, and they&apos;ve proven enough to join the strong.&quot; He motions for them to approach, and when they do, Isla drags my shirt for me to follow.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But he stops me.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Isla tries to defend me. &quot;Titus was the Valedictorian of our class. He&apos;s at the same level. He&apos;s the best of all of us! Go on, tell him,&quot; Isla tells me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I look down at the outwaller fabrics that cover my body: shoddy yet dense and warm, or they would be, if there weren&apos;t so many holes torn in them.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;I feel my hands tension. I&apos;m unsure whether I have the strength to do it myself this time, but I&apos;ve run out of allies to expend and paths to take.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Isla tries to defend me. &quot;Titus was the Valedictorian of our class. He&apos;s at the same level. He&apos;s the best of all of us! Go on, tell him,&quot; Isla tells me.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The pencil-necked Garnet-class cadet across from me shakes like the rest of them, never having witnessed real violence in his life. I don&apos;t approach him, yet he backs himself into a corner. The car full of prisoners parts like a bad haircut to let him by.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We don&apos;t have to do this, you know,&quot; he says, steadying the knife as his hand trembles. As I approach closer, his eyes widen and he shields himself, thinking of me as some psychotic vagrant from the city fringe. &quot;I&apos;m trained in combat, unlike you, vagrant. I&apos;ll cut you open!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then try me,&quot; I say. My hands are perfectly steady. The same mantra of Sylvia and Lyra&apos;s last words they spoke to me cycles through my mind. Bedrock is the most solid state of all.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He lunges for a warning slice, so off-balanced that it almost carries him into the onlookers. I still stand there, passively, my body unhinged towards any defensive position.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He speaks words just to get a rise out of the Chymaeran, to idle and show his toughness, but the fear of that moral edge is something he can&apos;t ever hope to hide. I can tell, because despite everything, I still hang on the same edge. Rank means nothing when the weight of our souls is the same. Or so I tell myself. But the only way back is to cross an unforgivable line I still haven&apos;t crossed.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I begin walking towards him, and even though I&apos;m average height, my build is intimidating enough to drive him back. He mutters something indiscernible. The Chymaeran grows impatient. And as the last moment of action passes by, I wonder if I&apos;ll be stuck in this moment forever, just like last time.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But then his heel catches on the leg of one of the prisoners. He trips. The serrated edge fumbles through his hands, almost at a half-turn before he reaches for it again.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I duck out of the way just in time to miss it again, twisting my body left as it passes me, forgetting about the knife I&apos;m still clutching in a death grip. I feel a resistance, then hear a futile gasp, when I finally collect myself enough to step back.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;When I look back at the scrawny cadet, the slice parts his jaw like a cleft chin. Just the smallest paper-cut is enough for those with no Essence, and I turn away before I can watch it cycle through him.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;As I feel all of his meager Essence enter my circuits, I hear her words as they cross my mind. You will never be better. You will never deserve that perfect world with all the ones you&apos;ve left behind!</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Chymaeran takes my refusal to watch as a sign of resilience. &quot;You have a chance, vagrant,&quot; he says, stepping aside the door. Vera and her fireteam look on with disbelief: my back was to all of them when it happened, and for all they know, I murdered the Garnet-class weakling in cold blood, unaffected.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Past the steaming train cars wet with melted frost that drips from their bowed roofs, two lines form beyond each train car&apos;s door, separated by a tall fence. One of them is short and straight. The other bends and serpentines on itself, taking at least twenty times the space of the other. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I peer to my right and left. The lines are short, but both extents of the train stretch so far in an arc of repetition that they disappear into the snowstorm.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;All I can see is a single building in the center, looking far too small to contain all of us: and the survivors, strong or weak, filing into it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The few cars already emptied are being loaded with something I can&apos;t discern in the blinding white, but there&apos;s so much of it. It&apos;s the only thing that exits this place besides the elderly guards: in barrels and boxes aged for so long it almost looks like they&apos;re made of petrified wood.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The line of cowards fills with so many that they run out of space to file, but in my line only two more join. They&apos;re shaken with disbelief, refusing to believe what it took them to join us.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;One at a time. Six feet apart. Don&apos;t stop,&quot; one guard says on repeat, ushering the weak with a baton.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So you are the fighters,&quot; another Afterlife guard says. &quot;Do you feel this, right now? Or have you gotten too used to it? Enjoy the snow, the cold, the fresh air. Remember every feeling of it. Because it will be the last memory you&apos;ll live on for as long as you make it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;They call our car number. It numbers somewhere in the hundreds.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Around fourteen times a year, I get to witness this,&quot; he says, to our small group of seven. &quot;Fourteen provinces graduating, their times equally spaced, arriving on seven or eight full loads of trains &mdash; but for me, it&apos;s so much longer.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He motions for us to follow, and the closer I draw to the round-domed stone edifice, the more I feel the energy of this place vibrate in my circuits. I can&apos;t explain how I sense its direction, but something immensely powerful feels as if it will set me into seizure, twisting my stomach as we pass beneath the frame. I seem to be the only one it affects, because I&apos;m the only one that&apos;s been afforded this much Essence.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The entrance hallway is pitch dark: only twenty meters or so long, but it feels like I&apos;ve been walking in-place for minutes. It feels as if the front and back of my body are trying to meet each other in the center, constrained in a straight line by some flux that feels as if it compresses me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The air becomes so dense that it makes us light-headed. Every time I step forward, my legs feel like they hinge slower than the hour hands of a clock, but when my feet fall behind to draw the next step, they accelerate with such speed I think I&apos;ll trip. Every sensation brought from ether behind or in front of me renders my mind as a useless gage, feeling sensations that aren&apos;t there, as if I&apos;m being crunched and stretched and slowed and sped all at the same time, only stabilized by the head of Jarrett struggling in front of me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The only sensation I trust next is when I know it&apos;s ended, when we arrive in the great central chamber spanning at least a hundred yards in diameter. I turn around to peer through that strange hallway I just entered, and on the other end, a new band of cadets stands nearly still. Beyond them, white snowflakes rest still in the air like stars in a photo-negative sky.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Some cadets retch from the nausea. Some vomit. Others gaze in awe at the scale of the chamber. Above us, true sunlight pours through a glassless dome where the snowflakes stick to nothing, refusing to cross the threshold of its geometry. The circular walk rims around a vacant gap in the center where turbulent winds flow upwards, and above us in the very center of the dome are concentric spinning wheels.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Something thuds directly behind me from above. On the ground I find a mess of feathers, and a bird that looks as if it&apos;s been half-consumed. The left-wing is still flushed with healthy feathers, but I can tell it snapped its neck running into something. Bisecting it is a thin line of advancing decay, and all that&apos;s left of it on the other side is just bone.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You took that transition over the course of a couple minutes,&quot; our Afterlife chaperon says. &quot;That&apos;s why you could take it. Up there, across that dome &mdash; the whole transition takes place across a breadth no wider than a finger.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I look behind me. The next cadets approach no faster, still as statues in the corridor.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then how did it snap its neck? There&apos;s nothing up there.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It went from a speed out there to the speed in here, he says. I look closer at the head, flattened like the top of a mushroom, as if the impact happened inside itself. &quot;From a second per second to roughly seven seconds per second. That&apos;s all it took.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We all find ourselves looking up towards the great mechanical wheels at the center of the dome: six concentric ones, the smallest one spinning so fast its just a blur. Each, in turn, spins slower and slower, until the outermost ring rotates about once a minute.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Let this be a lesson as to why you don&apos;t jump down the pit, there,&quot; he says. &quot;Only transition slowly. Or else the effects of dilation will flatten you, and you&apos;ll crush inwards on yourself. You&apos;re much better as a resource.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The nauseous cadets collect themselves and wipe their mouths, and after they regain their footing, the Chymaeran takes us to a room filled with white-and-red garments.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I want each of you to take three sets of clothing. It will be all you&apos;ll have,&quot; he says, and so we filter through stacks of the garments. Most of them are tattered and aged, splotched with long-dried blood in some places, so old that the smell died with it. Others disintegrate to dust when I touch them. I pull three from the stack that look remotely clean and rejoin the group as he goads us down towards the bottom.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Jarrett pulls his fireteam aside and mutters to them, motioning for me to come over. &quot;We can all make it out of here. I don&apos;t know where they&apos;re taking us, but there will be blood. And we know we&apos;re the strongest group out of all of them.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But what happens when we have to face each other?&quot; Delvin asks. &quot;You know where this is going! Any other luck and I would have had to face one of you,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But we&apos;re too valuable to them, and they know it,&quot; Jarrett says. &quot;They won&apos;t waste us because we&apos;re limited.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We change into our new clothes, indifferentiable from each other. Somewhere across the way, the vast majority of the cadets that came here wear black: even with the darkness of the fabric, I can tell there is no blood splotched on them. Their task is something different, though ours is certain.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;All our possessions are removed next. The only thing that matters to me is people, and all the ones I care about have been torn from me, so I don&apos;t put up a fight like Vera, who insists on keeping some gift from her sister.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You won&apos;t be needing it,&quot; an Afterlife guard says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I relinquish my obsidian necklace. It will be of no use to me anymore. The bright memory it carries is branded inside me, along with all the faces, along with the mission whose insidious demands I&apos;ll force myself to meet. All that we&apos;re left with is the most elementary commodities to scrape our last days or months of survival &mdash; before we&apos;re fed to the great machine of the Afterlife, churning hapless youth into the Essence they need to build a false throne of the Gods.</p>",
        "Somewhere beyond this place, the snow hangs stagnant in the air. The Backwoods of the First Red returns to eternal winter, the thousand dead reduced to Frosthards. Even further out there, Endogeny eviscerates the innocent civilians.  A lift erupts in flames on the mountainside from Carmine intervention, not crushing the bastard daughter beneath because she was murdered too early. And above, the Afterlife celebrate the dawn of a new age, ignorant to the weight of all their actions, so focused on the light of a new Golden Age they&apos;ll destroy anything that obstructs them."

I don&apos;t want to make better friends with any of them or else it will be harder.

        "<p>&emsp;This place wasn&apos;t erected as a prison two-hundred years ago. All the ancient farming tools tell a different story of why it came to exist: purposed as a tool for infinite, bountiful harvests beyond comprehension, feeding the masses of this frozen landscape for generations. Each level is unfathomably tall and wide, spanning so high it&apos;s impossible to tell the ceiling, each floor latticed with an intricate maze of patterned walls and rooms that act as structural supports for the great openings of grass fields.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;There are three great columns of light stretching from freedom to the bottomless depths below: the dome we saw was only the tip of one of them. We&apos;ve counted fifty-three sleeps in lieu of days, and looking up from the second level to the sky above, it took twenty-five of them before the sun crossed the sky.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I hardly talk to Vera&apos;s fireteam. I only talk when I have to. They spend most of their time reminiscing between tending the fields and busy work. I spent a week of free time watching a single bird cross the span of the dome &mdash; the only fortunate feature of this dungeon being the boundless harvests of produce from the lower floors.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We all know we&apos;re being fattened up for the harvest. The food we produce is sent back on the trains to the main city as feed for the rest of the civilians, so much that it&apos;s almost impossible to store. On the level above, it&apos;d be a year before another train of cadets arrived. Down here, Isla told us it would be another thirteen YEARS &mdash; just enough time for the tens of thousands of cadets to be processed here for the next batch. She uncovered the nature of this dungeon in a couple days from just water droplets. She ran the math in her head of how long it took them to fall, with some geometric math of how high the ceiling is. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The time of the floors below are unknown to us. At least for Isla&apos;s experiment, the raindrops accelerate and flatten so quickly that it&apos;s impossible to tell. Isla says that at a constant rate, the ones below us would live ten days for every one of ours, and if there&apos;s anything below that, roughly one-hundred-and-thirty days per day for them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;All we know is that cadets keep disappearing. All I can manage to guess is that nearly ten thousand are on this floor, but every week we&apos;ve been here, it&apos;s been enough to notice, and it always happens at the same time.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;If you stand near the exact center of the three empty columns and hold your breath, hoping the silence is enough to coax out the faintest sound, some cadets swear you hear clashing metal somewhere high above, so slow and faded like a bow drawn against strings. But the mysteries of this place don&apos;t matter me. I&apos;ve been trying to steel myself for something I know is coming. I don&apos;t want to make better friends with any of them or else it will be harder. And after the endless stretches of exhausting labor, the only place I find myself is back in the room of a hundred bunk beds, guarding the few possessions I&apos;ve accumulated in my time here.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The only thing I have space for is the words of the ones I betrayed. All the insanity of living and dying feels like a distant anecdote because it only lasted for two weeks of continuous time, and the threads on my wrist are the only proof of it, or else I&apos;d believe again that death was permanent.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The same day they called us to &apos;Victory Row&apos; was the same day the moon crossed the dome&apos;s threshold. We were grouped together by the train we came on: all of us the self-proclaimed &apos;strong&apos; with untenable beards and longer hair. It mystifies me how Vera still preserves most of her appearance: I guess that, to her, it is all she has left to obsess over.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Your time has come. I hope you&apos;ve all trained well,&quot; our same chaperon tells us. He&apos;s far older now, telling us he&apos;s been a level lower this whole time. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I ask him about his age, and he shakes his head. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He says, &quot;You might think we&apos;re the ones in power here. But all of us, captor or slave, are just pawns for the Afterlife.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I haven&apos;t seen Vera, Isla, or Jarrett in ages: they&apos;ve mostly kept to themselves. For so long, Vera thought her sister was still alive from what I told her, that &quot;they&apos;re all waiting,&quot; and after she realized the hollowness of my words, she refused to speak to me since.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Two-hundred-and-fifty-six of you will enter,&quot; he says. &quot;Most of you will lose your lives to the people next to you. But the few that persist will be the greatest champions of the Afterlife, earning your place among our ranks. This is why we raise the greatest soldiers in this entire world, the most fearsome force against all the other races. Because they&apos;re not only the best of their class: they&apos;re the best of the one percent of the one percent, hardened through learned bloodlust and vicious carnage, untouchable by any force of nature.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He points to the levels below.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You probably still wonder what happened to the ones that said they were weak that first day. They outnumbered all of you. That detail probably slipped your mind, didn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Several of us nod.</p>",
        "&quot;They were the ones that kept you, our most valuable resource, alive and fed, so that you wouldn&apos;t succumb to the diseases and starvation that killed the majority of them. They keep the city of Blackwater fed, so that the civilians can raise new cadets to take their place. You are all the losers: producers or fighters, the weakest class, but the civilians are the victors of the Academy, the top third, the ones whose blood and intellect was great enough to keep them at the top, the genes we need. And you,&quot; he says: &quot;you are just the dirt we pan for specks of fools&apos; gold.&quot;"

        "<p>&emsp;Every time I shut my eyes to sleep I&apos;m there again, and even in the face of peril, my mind refuses me a dream of peace and comfort, inching closer and closer to that unspeakable end I wrought upon them, thinking I could go back at whatever cost. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m not like them, and I will never be: the way the Afterlife indiscriminately kill to preserve their dream of a Golden Age, because my vision is real, and I can feel it waiting there on the other side.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The cells on the second floor are shoddy. I can tell how ephemeral each cadet&apos;s stay was from the names etched into the walls as the last fading testaments that they were here. Paper scrawled in ink with last messages and poems, requests for messages to carry by those that survive. Several are names I recognized from roll call in the vast expanse below, but I&apos;m just shocked how many of them there are.</p>",

The fools built something again they knew they would have to lose, and now that the Afterlife comes to collect on their promise, they shiver and tremble, chattering the chains that bind their wrists behind them, voices wavering, calling the names of allies and estranged loved ones for comfort: people they know they&apos;ll never see again.</p>",

The sizzling grows louder after the twelve seconds have passed, and when I hear the two cadets collide in to each other, wavering before they collapse without the balance of their bound hands, they fall headlong into oblivion, their voices high and shrill before they disappear into eternity.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Next!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Two more rush, and as I approach, I find I can see them easier, backlit by tendrils of moonlight and electric lamps. The nearest cadet shouts with all he has, drowning himself out of any chance of hesitation. On the far side, the other cadet stalls, but once their feet scald on the metal beam, they&apos;re forced to move without anywhere to go, jumping off the beam to hang on the side.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The closest cadet makes it to the other side without a hitch. I hear the sound of anguish when the fallen tries to left herself, only for the metal to burn her hands and cast her to the bottom along with the other two.</p>",

I meant to drive that knife several weeks ago. It was my intention to kill. I&apos;ve changed. I&apos;m nothing like I was, and ever since that point I threw the hatch to leave my two closest friends to die, I&apos;ve been changed forever.</p>",

My body is so light. I float through the air, high enough that I can almost feel time&apos;s deceleration when Delvin ducks beneath me.</p>",

Above us is another grand window to the sky, where continuous dawn radiates the rugged terrain in a thin orange haze, casting just enough light to shimmer the instruments of war strewn about the field.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My mind already spins the workings of a plan.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Four went out, and one returns,&quot; says the guard tending the gates. The survivor has bruises all up their neck, eyes bloodshot, hands trembling as they shamble past the gate. &quot;Whatever you can find is a tool to get the upper hand. This is not about just having the courage to kill anymore. It&apos;s about plotting and following through.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We step in front of our usher, waiting for the moment of deliverance to come. He raises his arm and fires a flare into the air. The surge of anxious energy is electric, riding the nerves from my core into every extremity, charged with such energy it&apos;s unbearable to keep it inside.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The furthest flare blasts. Motion fires all my frail limbs at once, so starved from sedentary stillness that my feet tear the thin grass in tufts of dormant tan. I scan the ground for anything that can aid me: I was trained in everything they&apos;d teach me, far more than all these other frail firebrands.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I don&apos;t let the anticipation of the cadets on the other side to shake me from my focus. So many bloodied rocks are scattered with a signature stain on each of them, and in the shale sand, several broken blades of the cheapest metal crumple to age and wear.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;All the good weapons are surely in the center, brought by every poor bastard that failed to use them well. I split right as Vera hangs left, hoping to find anything as I scrounge between the rocks. There&apos;s a pole-axe splintered in half, too top-heavy to drive it at anything and not lose it, but I grab it anyway, because if I can have any weapon whose iron isn&apos;t the quotient of spilt blood, it puts me high above fisticuffs and rocks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It hangs uncomfortably in my white-knuckle grasp, holding an arm&apos;s-length of shaft at its jagged end. The eye of the metallic head wobbles at its shoulder, enough for no more than a single swing, but I&apos;m more afraid of that moral anxiety that made me hesitate in the train car, and as I approach the center of the long-abandoned growing chamber, I grow leery in the absence of conflict.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I spend a moment longer nestled in a burrow of rocks, holding my breath as I take in the faintest whispers in the air, but all I hear is the distant clatter of tools. Anticipation is half the mental battle, but too much of it leads to sloth, and the longer I wait for the signal of anything, the greater that voice of conspiracy rises.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Unable to wait any longer, I shamble to the top of the outcropping to take a higher view. Guns would be too quick a weapon for what they&apos;re trying to test here, and take too much maintenance to last any relative year. Bows would run out of arrows in an instant&mdash;Gods know how long Sylvia spent fletching for perfection only to use it for practice.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;From the top I see both ends of the arena, but all I can see is entirely vacant. The next two pairs of cadets look on in fervent anticipation. I squint to follow their eyes, and they glare to that passage that Vera went down.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Alone they&apos;d be no match for one of us, but together, with the right strategy, they could wipe either one of us out.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I steady both hands on the unpolished metal axe as I approach the space where they wait, knowing this is now a battle of who dares the most, and if they&apos;ve already dared to split her skull before she could shout my name, they&apos;ll stop at nothing to send me to the Reservoir.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;In a moment of distraction, my right foot slips on a bundle of rocks. It&apos;s too late to react, and before I can regain my footing I slide with them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Got you, fucker!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My hands raise the axe before I can react. It&apos;s not a voice I recognize: the bastards have been hiding out here the whole time.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Vera&apos;s body is unceremoniously sprawled right in the center, and I&apos;m sure they left it there to dishearten me. They bludgeoned her head in before she could shout for help, crumpled on the ground like her sister as nothing but a bloody mess. Dragon Class or not, she stood no chance.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The rockslide makes the ground fluid like slipping on oil.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You stupid vagrant, you should have frozen with the rest of your kind in the outer walls,&quot; he says, before taking a swing at my head. I manage to lift the axe head, but as soon as the shoddy sword sparks against the steel, I lose my grasp and the face of it clocks me in the head.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Above,&quot; he says, and once he points up, a full-size boulder crashes at my feet. It clips my toes. I screech with pain as it binds me to the center, crunching the bones of my feet as I stumble with my last good leg. All I have is the head of the axe, and I hold it awkwardly by the eye without the wooden neck.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Just give up,&quot; they say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Not a chance.&quot; Trapped by the rock, the loose cartilage of my foot crunches like red-hot sand as I find my balance, but my adrenaline is too high to feel it: that&apos;s a debt of pain I take from my future self if I ever make it through this.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The first one makes a predictable high swing as the other scans for another rock: pinned like a dissected frog I have nowhere to go but face the lone firebrand head-on.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I dodge the blade of the rusted sword. He falters after expecting it to fully connect, and in his moment of vulnerability I feel myself hesitate when I remember all the bodies of the First Red; the chaos I created; the scope of devastation I never had the chance to assess.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The opportunity passes. Before I can retaliate another earthen mass crunches my skull, and I lay there helpless as my adversaries relish in their victory.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Dazed and furious, sprawled alongside Vera, I watch as they spare no mercy on us. &quot;If you weren&apos;t so goddamn green, you&apos;d have a chance,&quot; he says, before spitting down on me. He raises his boot, and I&apos;m dragged backwards once more before he can stomp my head in.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This time I can feel how saturated my circuits are with Essence, and before that tensile force can drag me any further into the countless hours I spent alone in my cell, I reach out with all the spiteful anger and regret I have, grappling for that limbic connection to return to the moments before I gave in to that pathetic sense of restraint.</p>",

And that dragged all the rest of my fireteam into this mess,&quot; she says. &quot;I don&apos;t know how you know about the lift, what you mean by &apos;this time,&apos; but she was supposed to board with us, and I&apos;m the reason she was still on the list. I would never leave my sister to die, regardless of how much my mother Victoria hates her, believe me,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;All the fame and recognition. The top of her class, the star of Blackwater, and yet she died still trying to prove the value of the name she created,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Sylvia was wrong. This isn&apos;t a reality where any of us deserve to suffer. I can&apos;t accept any of this. And we need to survive no matter what it takes.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The next group is pushed into the crucible with nothing, told to scrounge for the tools that will grant them their survival.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Do you really think you can bring yourself to do it? I saw what happened in the train car, but, you know&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I can do it,&quot; I tell her.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Whoever clings to life the tightest wins. Whoever can persuade themselves of the most unshakable reason to survive will find that last strength when they need it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And you think you have that,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I have that more than anyone here. Because I still have hope. I know that I can save us. And I&apos;m not afraid of dying for that.&quot; I can convince myself if I commit it to words.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Everybody is already dead,&quot; she says. She bows her head. &quot;My sister. The whole rest of your fireteam. And Gods know if the others are alive. What&apos;s left for any of us when everything is gone?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp; &quot;Whatever we can scrape from what remains.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We toe the line when the next pair leaves, realizing it&apos;s impossible to see the other side of the arena, besides the great wall marking its border two hundred yards out. Above us is another grand window to the sky, where continuous dawn radiates the rugged terrain in a thin orange haze, casting just enough light to shimmer the instruments of war strewn about the field.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My mind already spins the workings of a plan.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Divide and conquer,&quot; I say. &quot;We outmatch all of the cadets here. We have a solid shot here, Val, just don&apos;t lose your&mdash;&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;From between the rocks, a single cadet emerges triumphant, grimaced with an expression of emotional exhaustion. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Four went out, and one returns,&quot; says the guard tending the gates. The survivor has bruises all up their neck, eyes bloodshot, hands trembling as they shamble past the gate. &quot;Whatever you can find is a tool to get the upper hand. This is not about just having the courage to kill anymore. It&apos;s about plotting and following through.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We step in front of our usher, waiting for the moment of deliverance to come. He raises his arm and fires a flare into the air. The surge of anxious energy is electric, riding the nerves from my core into every extremity, charged with such energy it&apos;s unbearable to keep it inside.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The furthest flare blasts. Motion fires all my frail limbs at once, so starved from sedentary stillness that my feet tear the thin grass in tufts of dormant tan. I scan the ground for anything that can aid me: I was trained in everything they&apos;d teach me, far more than all these other frail firebrands.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I don&apos;t let the anticipation of the cadets on the other side to shake me from my focus. So many bloodied rocks are scattered with a signature stain on each of them, and in the shale sand, several broken blades of the cheapest metal crumple to age and wear.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;All the good weapons are surely in the center, brought by every poor bastard that failed to use them well. I split right as Vera hangs left, hoping to find anything as I scrounge between the rocks. There&apos;s a pole-axe splintered in half, too top-heavy to drive it at anything and not lose it, but I grab it anyway, because if I can have any weapon whose iron isn&apos;t the quotient of spilt blood, it puts me high above fisticuffs and rocks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It hangs uncomfortably in my white-knuckle grasp, holding an arm&apos;s-length of shaft at its jagged end. The eye of the metallic head wobbles at its shoulder, enough for no more than a single swing, but I&apos;m more afraid of that moral anxiety that made me hesitate in the train car, and as I approach the center of the long-abandoned growing chamber, I grow leery in the absence of conflict.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I spend a moment longer nestled in a burrow of rocks, holding my breath as I take in the faintest whispers in the air, but all I hear is the distant clatter of tools. Anticipation is half the mental battle, but too much of it leads to sloth, and the longer I wait for the signal of anything, the greater that voice of conspiracy rises.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Unable to wait any longer, I shamble to the top of the outcropping to take a higher view. Guns would be too quick a weapon for what they&apos;re trying to test here, and take too much maintenance to last any relative year. Bows would run out of arrows in an instant&mdash;Gods know how long Sylvia spent fletching for perfection only to use it for practice.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;From the top I see both ends of the arena, but all I can see is entirely vacant. The next two pairs of cadets look on in fervent anticipation. I squint to follow their eyes, and they glare to that passage that Vera went down.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Alone they&apos;d be no match for one of us, but together, with the right strategy, they could wipe either one of us out.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I steady both hands on the unpolished metal axe as I approach the space where they wait, knowing this is now a battle of who dares the most, and if they&apos;ve already dared to split her skull before she could shout my name, they&apos;ll stop at nothing to send me to the Reservoir.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;In a moment of distraction, my right foot slips on a bundle of rocks. It&apos;s too late to react, and before I can regain my footing I slide with them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Got you, fucker!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My hands raise the axe before I can react. It&apos;s not a voice I recognize: the bastards have been hiding out here the whole time.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Vera&apos;s body is unceremoniously sprawled right in the center, and I&apos;m sure they left it there to dishearten me. They bludgeoned her head in before she could shout for help, crumpled on the ground like her sister as nothing but a bloody mess. Dragon Class or not, she stood no chance.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The rockslide makes the ground fluid like slipping on oil.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You stupid vagrant, you should have frozen with the rest of your kind in the outer walls,&quot; he says, before taking a swing at my head. I manage to lift the axe head, but as soon as the shoddy sword sparks against the steel, I lose my grasp and the face of it clocks me in the head.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Disoriented but finally free, I stumble to my feet. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Where&apos;s your damn friend?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Above,&quot; he says, and once he points up, a full-size boulder crashes at my feet. It clips my toes. I screech with pain as it binds me to the center, crunching the bones of my feet as I stumble with my last good leg. All I have is the head of the axe, and I hold it awkwardly by the eye without the wooden neck.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Just give up,&quot; they say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Not a chance.&quot; Trapped by the rock, the loose cartilage of my foot crunches like red-hot sand as I find my balance, but my adrenaline is too high to feel it: that&apos;s a debt of pain I take from my future self if I ever make it through this.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The first one makes a predictable high swing as the other scans for another rock: pinned like a dissected frog I have nowhere to go but face the lone firebrand head-on.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I dodge the blade of the rusted sword. He falters after expecting it to fully connect, and in his moment of vulnerability I feel myself hesitate when I remember all the bodies of the First Red; the chaos I created; the scope of devastation I never had the chance to assess.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The opportunity passes. Before I can retaliate another earthen mass crunches my skull, and I lay there helpless as my adversaries relish in their victory.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Dazed and furious, sprawled alongside Vera, I watch as they spare no mercy on us. &quot;If you weren&apos;t so goddamn green, you&apos;d have a chance,&quot; he says, before spitting down on me. He raises his boot, and I&apos;m dragged backwards once more before he can stomp my head in.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This time I can feel how saturated my circuits are with Essence, and before that tensile force can drag me any further into the countless hours I spent alone in my cell, I reach out with all the spiteful anger and regret I have, grappling for that limbic connection to return to the moments before I gave in to that pathetic sense of restraint.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;My mind pulses when the splintered pole-axe slips from my hands. The tendrils of my conscious mind from moments later reach deep in this frail vessel as they puppeteer another lace of thread, and as my awareness overwrites every cell of my past failure, faster than the brain sends signals to the muscles, I dash directly for that outcropping, praying to whatever God or Goddess that grants me this thread that I&apos;m not too late.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My bare feet and hands scrape, stub, and slice on every sharp edge that can pull me there closer, and I no longer care about all the sound I make. In my future memory they laugh at me in my dying moments. Every breath wasted running is another chance for them to ambush her. I don&apos;t want to care about her, but there&apos;s this primal rage of humiliation and defeat that exhausts every ounce of life from my shambling corpse, and I can feel my circuits light with that otherworldly energy providing power where there is none.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;There&apos;s a sound of scraping rock for a moment like chalk dragged on its edge, and I realize I&apos;ve found the first one. I glance from higher and see all three of them, right as Vera spots the lower cadet, mistaken that he&apos;s acting alone and defenseless. She could eviscerate them in swordplay, as I&apos;ve learned from years of facing their fireteam&mdash;but there are no tactics to stop a chunk of stone that plummets from the sky.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The actor draws back in fear towards the ambush. These firebrands are so used to weakness  at the bottom of their ranks that his expression is flawless, and Lyra wholly buys it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She raises a dagger she found nestled somewhere in the rocks. &quot;This is nothing personal,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The cadet with the stone is dumbfounded at the success of their plan, and struggles as he raises it to the ledge. It will be the last thought he has as I rush at him: with his hands full, he has no chance to react.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My whole body is just a vehicle for that white-hot fury to act on its own. I don&apos;t just want them to die, but I want them to suffer, and so when I drive the mass from the cadet&apos;s hands, I body him into the pit with my shoulder. He falls flat on the same surface Lyra&apos;s thoughts were splattered on, concussed from the shock of his head crashing against the asymmetries of the rock. It&apos;s the perfect crushing face.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Though my arms have withered to little more than emaciated lean muscle, I&apos;m able to lift the same stone with ease.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Vera draws back when she recognizes the cadets&apos; crafty ploy. Before she reaps retribution, I cast the stone from atop the ledge, ensuring I don&apos;t make the same mistake that they did.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The loud crunch is satisfying in that brief moment. Sprawled in his back, the cadet panics when he realizes he can no longer move his legs, and both the adversaries below watch in disbelief. Lungs crushed, he has no breath to scream, only a mind to process the useless pain he can no longer resist.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My anger is as blind as that endless injustice I suffered, and with their lives, I will paint my surroundings with their entrails until every debt has been repaid. I heave another rock, and another, until every hard part of the flesh puppet below is liquefied from the trauma, and when the unspeakable horror moves the two cadets below so far that they tremble, I join them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The other cadet brandishes a feeble knife that couldn&apos;t cut spiderwebs, and when he lunges, all that persists in my mind is that last sight of him smiling, triumphant, calling me weak as he spits on me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He tries another jab, but he&apos;s too slow. I&apos;ve been trained as a killer and I no longer hesitate. Grasping his arm, I twist and punch beneath his shoulder in a space that shatters his ribcage. He still manages to hold the knife in a death grip, and slices again off-balance, managing to connect with my arm.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I bash again at his ribs. I tension my fingers in his hair though he still refuses to let go.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Die, fucker!&quot; He manages, and right as he tries to strike me again, another dagger digs deep into his neck.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Vera stands beside me, her eyes wet, gasping for breath as she wipes the residue of the last cadet off her uniform. But as the loser chortles away on the last wet breaths of life, I refuse to waste it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can tell he&apos;s dead when his weak trail of Essence flows in to me, but that doesn&apos;t matter. He goes limp when I bash his head against the jagged wall, again and again and again, until none of his pathetic shit-eating grin is left to taunt me, just a gaping hole.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;I fall to my knees though my eyes refuse me tears. I can feel the pulse of the life still in my veins. Vera extends a wet hand to lift me, and so I let her, limping across the battlefield as the Afterlife come to collect their mulch for the lower gardens.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We don&apos;t speak another word as she drags me, tugging at the arm I&apos;ve extended around her shoulders. My hands tremble from shock, and when the adrenaline fades, all I&apos;m left with is the price that all those acts of violence cost.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She drops me at the entrance, too disgusted to turn around and watch.  They drag me off to my cell where another meal waits, another place card of congratulations telling me I&apos;m one step closer to the end.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I refuse to eat that night. </p>",
        "The Afterlife heals my wounds with a small transfer of Essence to the parted flesh. I&apos;ve proved myself as a valuable asset with a chance. I&apos;ve done everything I had to in order to survive, and now that I&apos;ve crossed this line, nothing can hold me back from returning to claim my perfect end."

This isn&apos;t a battle of cunning or strategy, all they intend for this to be is just a battle of bloodshed and attrition with few survivors,&quot; I say. &quot;They don&apos;t want us to organize.

        "<p>&emsp;They still scan the distant colors for the faces of surviving friends, and I know it will be our downfall. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;To me, everyone I care about is already dead. But it&apos;s made me realize a truth that I knew all along, that when you strip away all the petty distractions of love and passion, we are only tools, only ever be measured by how useful we are, deserving nothing more and nothing less. We deserve nothing in this life. All we get is what we&apos;re given. Love is a hollow word for something that can never persist in such a cold place, because all we were ever made for is just to fight!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I hope I can change their minds even if just for a second. I won&apos;t make an effort to learn their names because I&apos;m leading them to die.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Every man and woman is born into this world alone and dies alone. So what is commitment but an illusion if it doesn&apos;t hold at either end?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;They&apos;re beginning to accept it, just enough.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We are alone together in this moment and we&apos;ll stop at nothing to preserve that. There is no salvation, no bright future or end for any of us but the cold peace of death that we&apos;ll reach either way. Let us be born again to the Reservoir whenever our last breath comes, but today, we&apos;ll fight with everything we have!&quot;</p>",
        "A blinding flare launches towards the top of the chamber as I finish those last words, snaring in that timeless space somewhere above us like a fixed star."

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What began with 256 cadets, in this class, has dwindled to a mere 60. You will be building your own fireteams now for our last exam. Separate into groups of four. You have one minute to decide,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Commotion rises between the survivors, and soon, the whole space is a cacophony of noise. I feel hands on my shoulder, pulling me every which way, my peers evaluating me for height and muscle though I&apos;m average height and look even more like a vagrant.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Get him. Titus!&quot; Isla says. She pulls me their way, but Vera resists.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;He&apos;s a ruthless murderer,&quot; she says.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The Warden continues. &quot;Should you be chosen to fight in our ranks, there are many friends that will become enemies. The ones you cared for the most will remain shitbloods. They are the weak, the fodder for the cause raised like cattle, and if you refuse to see it that way, then you are useless.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Royal Guardsmen hands me a green-colored mark. Isla gets blue. Vera gets red, and Delvin gets yellow.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Wait, we&apos;re not together for this?&quot; Isla panics, and Vera wears the same expression. &quot;I can&apos;t do this. Not a chance.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Delvin says, &quot;This is what all of this has been about. The courage to betray and the strength to separate, just like the Afterlife that betray their own race.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You can&apos;t tell me you&apos;re buying into this?&quot; Isla asks. &quot;Are all of you mad?&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Four banners drape from four equally-spaced sides, and against our collective will we&apos;re divided. I&apos;m surrounded by strangers with green marks hanging behind them, nor a single one I recognize, and I watch every cadet eyeing another surviving friend of a different color.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;There&apos;s a small room beneath each banner that once held supplies to tend the gardens, but the racks of rakes and spades have been replaced with the same shoddy weaponry from the last arena. Two-hundred-something extra marks are bunched in the back. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My teammates first fight over shields, then swords, until all that&apos;s left is just bows and arrows and daggers. I manage to grab a sword that fell behind the racks. It&apos;s in a better condition than all the rest, and when I step outside, I test its weight in a couple practice slashes.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A hand grabs my shoulder, and when I turn around, it&apos;s a taller cadet that studies my face.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Our makeshift squadron stands in silence. They wait for my reply, begging for some assurance of order. I peek between them at the other parties, already beginning to organize into groups. A hundred-or-so feet away to the right, Delvin stands at the center of Yellow. To the left, Vera&apos;s recognized from her secondhand fame as a commander of Red. And somewhere through the dense patch of forest, Isla reconvenes with her blue team, though I&apos;m unsure whether all of them are leaders.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What do we do?&quot; Zane asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s no terrain here like the last arena. It&apos;s all flat. This isn&apos;t a battle of cunning or strategy, all they intend for this to be is just a battle of bloodshed and attrition with few survivors,&quot; I say. &quot;They don&apos;t want us to organize. They expect that if we hold to our old alliances, we&apos;ll refuse to join the new team.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It makes sense,&quot; says Zane.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The only victor can ever be the one that will do whatever it takes, no matter how dirty their hands get. You will all kill without hesitation or else you are worthless,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;They still scan the distant colors for the faces of surviving friends, and I know it will be our downfall. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;To me, everyone I care about is already dead. But it&apos;s made me realize a truth that I knew all along, that when you strip away all the petty distractions of love and passion, we are only tools, only ever be measured by how useful we are, deserving nothing more and nothing less. We deserve nothing in this life. All we get is what we&apos;re given. Love is a hollow word for something that can never persist in such a cold place, because all we were ever made for is just to fight!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I hope I can change their minds even if just for a second. I won&apos;t make an effort to learn their names because I&apos;m leading them to die.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Every man and woman is born into this world alone and dies alone. So what is commitment but an illusion if it doesn&apos;t hold at either end?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;They&apos;re beginning to accept it, just enough.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We are alone together in this moment and we&apos;ll stop at nothing to preserve that. There is no salvation, no bright future or end for any of us but the cold peace of death that we&apos;ll reach either way. Let us be born again to the Reservoir whenever our last breath comes, but today, we&apos;ll fight with everything we have!&quot;</p>",

I expect us to head up and into the stale sunlight of eternal day, but we head further down into the depths. The nausea of relativity sickens me, but I&apos;ve learned to hold my breath to retain the meager scraps in my stomach. I&apos;m half the weight I was when I walked the same set of stairs, but there&apos;s still a spark of strength in my muscles I&apos;ve maintained through all of this.</p>",

My eyes struggle to adjust to the ambient light, but sure enough, I know what awaits me without a second glance. At the center of it all is the harbinger of the end, and around her, the Human-and-Chymaeran  colonists from the Afterlife watching over her. Her height in full Chymaeran form now reaches the first-story eaves of the buildings. This false mortal goddess is so much stronger than I remember&mdash;flooded with such Essence that from twenty yards away, my circuits raise gooseflesh on my arms.</p>",

The shock travels up my frail bones while she hardly moves a step, and whether it&apos;s thick Chymaeran scaling or solid muscle, my hands won&apos;t tell until it&apos;s over. But she doesn&apos;t smile with a sadistic smugness. She&apos;s still watching all her handlers as if our final skirmish is just a performance. </p>",

I can see a crack in this abomination&apos;s armor: something that makes me different from all the others she&apos;s ruthlessly killed, but I just don&apos;t get it. No. She gets off on the torment, watching me suffer somehow knowing the thread will just bring me back here again.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;It still spills me across the floor, and when I land on my right arm I shriek in agony: out of all the places to land, and my arm is fractured further over a small rusted garden trowel.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;I catch her in a moment of confusion before she can pummel the rest of me. I find that same space I drove the sword into Delvin, and without that stupid self-love he died on, I doubt anything will leak from me when it parts the soft meat between my ribs.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But she&apos;s quicker than me. Afraid, even, and she shouts while she ejects the spade from my grasp. It still manages to slice me like paper when it&apos;s driven a thumb&apos;s-length in, and I feel an amethyst pain when her hands crumple my wrists and we fall backwards together.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ll win again, and again, a thousand times&mdash;no&mdash;a million times, even more, and just one time, you&apos;ll make a mistake. Kill me now. I&apos;ll meet you again real soon, just do it. Do it!&quot; I plead her, but she&apos;s just bent over me with her hands pinning my biceps, as if she&apos;s too afraid to make the next move. &quot;Do it! Just let me go. All I&apos;ve ever loved is gone.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I feel a wetness on my face as the amethyst floods my veins. My eyes are too dry to cry, even when the end of this long cycle is just moments away.</p>",

I feel dragging, then heat, then stretching time, then bitter cold, until every sensation eludes me and all I&apos;m left with is the slow beating of my heart. </p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Among the surviving members of the Green, the Royal Guard call me the champion of Victory Row; the most vicious; their ideal candidate to fight as a grunt on the front lines. Immediately after the last challenge, the Warden demands my presence. And when I step into her office&mdash;adorned with the priceless trinkets and artifacts all her prisoners relinquished&mdash;she praises me for my ruthlessness, on a level like like &quot;none of the other failures in this Gods-forsaken pit.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She paints me the vision of a future I&apos;ve already witnessed, expecting the truth to captivate me.&quot;You&apos;re part of the last batch of Cadets being processed here, the last graduation now and forevermore,&quot; she starts. &quot;You&apos;ve proven you understand the sacrifice of self-preservation and the courage it takes: the force that keeps true Humans alive. And because of that, you are one of the few that might deserve to walk among us.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I bow my head in compliance knowing this pact is ephemeral. I can predicate her words before she speaks. All I can think of is the last step in this plan, and hope the Essence is enough to pull me all the way back. Because as sure as water finds its way to the lowest point, I will slay this abomination in any number of lives, then end myself.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;They guide me through the corridors. We pass a cart of the dead cadets being taken away to their final use. I see the unstaring eyes of Vera somewhere beneath them, but I refuse to allow my stomach to twist at the sight. This world, after all, is just the sawdust of that perfect reality, to be blown away on the winds of change.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Half a year of my life has passed, and for the first time in ages, we approach the stairs. I expect us to head up and into the stale sunlight of eternal day, but we head further down into the depths. The nausea of relativity sickens me, but I&apos;ve learned to hold my breath to retain the meager scraps in my stomach. I&apos;m half the weight I was when I walked the same set of stairs, but there&apos;s still a spark of strength in my muscles I&apos;ve maintained through all of this.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You know, Ullrich&apos;s order to switch this place to a combat zone came through only two days ago,&quot; one guard says to the other. &quot;How long has it been for us?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;A bloody damn eternity,&quot; the other replies.</p>",

Every transition feels like sinking in molasses, as if the air were thicker, like diving deeper and deeper into a bottomless lake. Only five days of waking time have passed since I was last down here, but I&apos;m certain it&apos;s not relativity that makes it feel longer. I can&apos;t tell a single face from the masses I spent half a year with, and when I go even deeper, the smell and sight of age and destitution only grows stronger.</p>",

Cadets in their fifties, sixties, seventies and older don&apos;t even turn to look at the relative vigor of my skin-and-bones. The concentric wheels atop the dome are so distant, but now I can see the centermost circles when they spin.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;There&apos;s a blocked-off, private circle of almost two acres in the center of this edgeless floor, in the dead center of the three vacant pillars of light, right below where the last arena would be two floors above. The walls are smooth unlike the jagged, cavernous surfaces of the rest of this labyrinth. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;When I enter, I feel the artificial glow of an ever-burning Essenced flame lighting the top of this space as a false sun. My eyes struggle to adjust to the ambient light, but sure enough, I know what awaits me without a second glance. At the center of it all is the harbinger of the end, and around her, the Human-and-Chymaeran  colonists from the Afterlife watching over her. Her height in full Chymaeran form now reaches the first-story eaves of the buildings. This false mortal goddess is so much stronger than I remember&mdash;flooded with such Essence that from twenty yards away, my circuits raise gooseflesh on my arms.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Her voice is ever-present and commanding.&quot;Leave us. This one is mine,&quot; I hear, and I&apos;d be petrified looking up if my anger were any lesser. The others scatter, and I find myself ten paces away from the Heiress. Fighting her in this state would be like fighting Ryder&apos;s statue if it sprung to action and tried to wipe out a whole city block.</p>",

Slender limbs of obsidian re-morph into the texture of flesh&mdash;and who knows if this isn&apos;t just the guise of another one of her victims. The crux of everything I loathe stands before me as a Human woman. And when the tar dissolves from her body, into garments and hair brighter than my half-year&apos;s first dawn, she stands no taller than I am.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because I&apos;m the reason you got it in the first place,&quot; she says, and I remember the last moments I witnessed. It was a smudge of black when i threw open the door to find the window ajar, the curtains dancing on frostbitten winds, and the first syllable of my sister&apos;s name before all my senses were robbed from me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You took her.&quot; I can&apos;t say the words without shuddering. &quot;This whole time, having me believe the only soul I&apos;ve ever cared for in this life is dead! Tell me, is she still alive?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ll be meeting her soon, no matter how this ends. That Thread can only lead you to one place: you probably think you&apos;re tethered from some distant beginning. But did you ever stop to think you&apos;re being dragged towards an unavoidable end?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I can change everything,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;m more a God than you will ever be, Mask. Because the only future I&apos;m tied to is draining all the Essence from your lifeless corpse!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The stewards part before this crucible can burn any hotter, and even the guards leave us.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You were too pathetic to save your friends &mdash; so pathetic you let them die,&quot; she says.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Shut the hell up!&quot; My nails bite the flesh of my pallid palms as the hate magnetizes me to her, fists drawn.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She says, &quot;And your sister? She deserved everything she got, along with that bastard father of hers. Both their deaths were long and painful.&quot; My feet scuttle faster than my muscles can handle. &quot;But you, Titus, I&apos;ll make sure yours is&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I feel my knuckles crack when they drive square into her chest. The shock travels up my frail bones while she hardly moves a step, and whether it&apos;s thick Chymaeran scaling or solid muscle, my hands won&apos;t tell until it&apos;s over. But she doesn&apos;t smile with a sadistic smugness. She&apos;s still watching all her handlers as if our final skirmish is just a performance. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You fucking bitch!&quot; I try the same hand again and coerce the answer, only to find if when the searing agony alarms all the nerves in my splintered arm.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I yelp when I withdraw, and I think she&apos;s found her chance to strike when she lunges for me, playing with her food, but there&apos;s still that same sense of hesitation from when we fought beyond the train car. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She stopped herself from reaching for me. I can see a crack in this abomination&apos;s armor: something that makes me different from all the others she&apos;s ruthlessly killed, but I just don&apos;t get it. No. She gets off on the torment, watching me suffer somehow knowing the thread will just bring me back here again.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But everyone boils over at some point. Though my muscles are gone, my mouth still waters, and I spit on her when she draws close again.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Fight me, you whore!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I try to hide my wincing when I&apos;m left with my weakest arm. That&apos;s when she takes her first swing: a slow left hook, telegraphing it all the way to my face though I&apos;m still too slow and spent to dodge it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It still spills me across the floor, and when I land on my right arm I shriek in agony: out of all the places to land, and my arm is fractured further over a small rusted garden trowel.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I still raise myself to my knees, then my feet, taking the dulled divot tool in my non-dominant hand.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re going to kill me with that?&quot; She asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Not this time,&quot; I say, and I flip it around in the palm of my hand.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I catch her in a moment of confusion before she can pummel the rest of me. I find that same space I drove the sword into Delvin, and without that stupid self-love he died on, I doubt anything will leak from me when it parts the soft meat between my ribs.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But she&apos;s quicker than me. Afraid, even, and she shouts while she ejects the spade from my grasp. It still manages to slice me like paper when it&apos;s driven a thumb&apos;s-length in, and I feel an amethyst pain when her hands crumple my wrists and we fall backwards together.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ll win again, and again, a thousand times&mdash;no&mdash;a million times, even more, and just one time, you&apos;ll make a mistake. Kill me now. I&apos;ll meet you again real soon, just do it. Do it!&quot; I plead her, but she&apos;s just bent over me with her hands pinning my biceps, as if she&apos;s too afraid to make the next move. &quot;Do it! Just let me go. All I&apos;ve ever loved is gone.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I feel a wetness on my face as the amethyst floods my veins. My eyes are too dry to cry, even when the end of this long cycle is just moments away.</p>",

Recover as you prepare for the final battle that lies ahead. That relentlessness is the most important thing you have to give: both to me, and to all those people you miss in another lifetime. From this frayed end of reality, I will give you all the strength you need to return. It is not your hardness, but your vulnerability, that will lead you to victory.&quot;"

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I do need you. You&apos;re my purpose. You&apos;re the treasure I have to protect and cherish, until our time here is up,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But why? What am I worth if I can&apos;t give anything to protect or help you? It&apos;s so uncomfortable, this . . . helplessness,&quot; I say. It&apos;s an unfamiliar feeling: that despite the thread and all my potential, there is a wall.</p>",
        "&quot;You don&apos;t have to do anything right now. All you need to do is accept my protection, and trust me when I say you are completely safe under my care,&quot; Ellie says. She embraces me as I watch the sky. &quot;You&apos;ve spent your entire life giving all without expecting anything in return. So cherish this moment. Recover as you prepare for the final battle that lies ahead. That relentlessness is the most important thing you have to give: both to me, and to all those people you miss in another lifetime. From this frayed end of reality, I will give you all the strength you need to return. It is not your hardness, but your vulnerability, that will lead you to victory.&quot;"

        "<p>&emsp;I have my limits, but that does not make me weak. I am as small as a speck of sand on the shores of Blackwater lake, but I still remain the furthest from nothing. I cannot change the world in it&apos;s entirety. My reach is small, and my influence in the affairs of this world is limited. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;So I choose my focus wisely when I prepare to return to that future past.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Ellie slept next to me for the first two weeks until the nightmares subsided and I stopped trembling. She still insists on it every night, from how many countless years she spent dreaming of this moment. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I ate well, and even better when I built the strength to start hunting, using the sharp obsidian arrows she synthesizes from Chymaeran scales. Every day I get one percent stronger, smarter, and more vulnerable to her kindness. She tells me I need to practice, and so she trains me, spending entire days practicing everything she can remember.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I still stay away from the Chieftains&apos; Lodge. I can&apos;t bring the courage to return there yet &mdash; knowing she lays there with all the people who ever trusted me before that fated end. We quarter ourselves in the barracks on the edge of the Backwoods, living on little, because there is nothing I can take back beyond a plan and a lighter soul.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She instructs me to drop the sword and rifle and take up my fists. She transfers her boundless Essence in short episodes. In two weeks, I can hardly sustain a steady flame in the palm of my hand, but she&apos;s so excited, praising me at every advancement, reminding me of how much they made her suffer just to learn that.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But she still refuses to tell me the plan. At first she would just change the subject, but as my curiosity runs deeper and deeper, she says I need to be stronger to accept what I have to do.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;All I can tell you is that your target is in the Afterlife, and it&apos;s a significant task you can&apos;t hope to ever do alone,&quot; she finally says, refusing to tell me until the last moments we share.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I&apos;m building muscle. I&apos;m not as strong as I was, but when I practice in combat, I&apos;ve almost been able to take her down.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I write everything I can remember until I feel I&apos;ve planned every contingency, every detail, and when she describes all she knows of the city above the smoke, I can visualize the last moments I&apos;ll spend there.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I think I&apos;m ready,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Without a doubt. I&apos;m ready to talk to her.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She embraces me tenderly. My sister has protected me all this time, giving me everything I could ever ask for, teaching me the lessons I needed to grow just a little more.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We walk out the door together, and the weather is just as warm as when the First Red called it home. The bodies of the dead no longer taint the air, and it&apos;s been so long since Ellie dissolved them to endogenous ash that they returned to the earth. If the ground accepts them &mdash; and nature can cycle on without hesitation &mdash; I know I can come to terms with this. It&apos;s a patch of frozen ice just like I left it. We&apos;ve been staying away from it this whole time, and now that Ellie and I approach the Lodge, the evidence of that past reveals itself.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I will grieve and mourn. There are sacrifices I will have to make, and terrible dilemmas whose outcomes I will have to accept. I will lose the ones closest to me &mdash; and if I can&apos;t accept that &mdash; I will forever be trapped in this endless cycle.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I return to the porch of the Chieftains&apos; Lodge to dwell in that last glimpse, and as the bodies of that cataclysmic reckoning emerge from the thawed ice, I remember everything.</p>",

And when we longed for a taste of that, did you really think all we&apos;d find was joy and peace?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She paused for a moment to receive the internal monologue. I found myself next to Lyra who already connected the pieces, unsure of how to react as I struggled myself to accept this revelation.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Sylvia resists. The winds pick up all around us as the ground shakes; distant tremblings of a familiar end I remember from a past life. I couldn&apos;t let the Goddess unwittingly trap me here.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You have to resist, Sylvia, please!&quot; I shouted. &quot;I have to go back. I have to save all of us, to make things right. The mission. Whatever that was. I have to finish the fight!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Just then, a distant flash lit the sky that only I could ever recognize.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Titus. I&apos;m sorry I dragged you into all of this. I&apos;ve only ever been sincere to you, in all that time we were blind to that truth of where we came from. But my love for you is &mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I know,&quot; I told her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We loved each other in the Reservoir, and yet . . . even with our memories lost, we still found that lost piece.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I just wish I could remember. Anything.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She descended in her heavenly raiments on the last pulse of Pure Essence, dissolving, reaching for one last kiss before she was withdrawn from the mortal plane. I turned my head up to her as she approached, but when three minutes passed since the flash lit the sky, the wall of pressure disintegrated her body to shimmering dust.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I fell to my knees. The First Red remobilized when they remembered the closeness of their last trial, as if nothing had ever happened.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You were him all along,&quot; Lyra said. &quot;You don&apos;t remember anything. The house. Father. The passing of the Mask to you. I knew it as soon as I saw that column of light. You&apos;re . . . Fletcher . . .&quot; She looked halfway torn between embracing me and outright killing me, but before she could react, Raine brandished me across the face with his fist.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You Gods-damn bastard!&quot; He shouted.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Raine, stop it!&quot; Lyra pleaded.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;He&apos;s getting thrown the only place he deserves to rot. Away from everything, and away from the Essence he longs to pilfer from our corpses.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Stop it, just give us a moment!&quot; Lyra says, but like his son, his mind is immovable. Two more Carmine join to drag me off the streets towards the windowless shed as Lyra falls behind.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And now, I stand here on this porch, opening my eyes to recall every minute of the events as they unfolded. I finally see the aftermath I missed when the Royal Guard dragged me from that shed. Lyra died five steps away from the crater in the floorboards. Raine died just past the shed. And when I notice Lyra&apos;s hand missing the ring finger, I draw a long, shallow breath before I anticipate her to speak to me again through death.</p>",
        "Her hand falls on my shoulder, and I shiver at her cold touch."

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Titus. I&apos;m sorry I dragged you into all of this. I&apos;ve only ever been sincere to you, in all that time we were blind to that truth of where we came from. But my love for you is &mdash;&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I just wish I could remember. Anything.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She descended in her heavenly raiments on the last pulse of Pure Essence, dissolving, reaching for one last kiss before she was withdrawn from the mortal plane. I turned my head up to her as she approached, but when three minutes passed since the flash lit the sky, the wall of pressure disintegrated her body to shimmering dust.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I fell to my knees. The First Red remobilized when they remembered the closeness of their last trial, as if nothing had ever happened.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You were him all along,&quot; Lyra said. &quot;You don&apos;t remember anything. The house. Father. The passing of the Mask to you. I knew it as soon as I saw that column of light. You&apos;re . . . Fletcher . . .&quot; She looked halfway torn between embracing me and outright killing me, but before she could react, Raine brandished me across the face with his fist.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You Gods-damn bastard!&quot; He shouted.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Raine, stop it!&quot; Lyra pleaded.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;He&apos;s getting thrown the only place he deserves to rot. Away from everything, and away from the Essence he longs to pilfer from our corpses.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Stop it, just give us a moment!&quot; Lyra says, but like his son, his mind is immovable. Two more Carmine join to drag me off the streets towards the windowless shed as Lyra falls behind.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And now, I stand here on this porch, opening my eyes to recall every minute of the events as they unfolded. I finally see the aftermath I missed when the Royal Guard dragged me from that shed. Lyra died five steps away from the crater in the floorboards. Raine died just past the shed. And when I notice Lyra&apos;s hand missing the ring finger, I draw a long, shallow breath before I anticipate her to speak to me again through death.</p>",

It&apos;s been a checklist in my mind forever &mdash; and even more so since that first column of light proved he was alive. But I realized there wasn&apos;t much else I really had to do. I was with you: for as short as it was, as close as I got to killing you at times, it all still felt like more than I could ask for.&quot;</p>",

I took that chance at life from you before you could see the fruits of that dedication. I was selfish because I had a different mission. I knew that all of Blackwater and everyone around it would be swallowed into the earth, met with a violent, sudden fate, and because of that, I had to do whatever it took to go back there. And regardless of that, I&apos;m sorry I betrayed you and everyone you care for. I hope that you can forgive me, even in death.&quot;</p>",

You feel that other consciousness intrude on your existence, and at first it&apos;s terrifying, threatening everything that makes you who you were. Ellie tells me that&apos;s why sometimes it takes years, while others can be instant. What it comes down to is compatibility and trust.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It reminds me of the exact same feeling when I enter my past self. But every time it&apos;s a hostile takeover, like killing a past fragment of myself in their sleep with just own hands: too slow that they soon awake to what&apos;s happening; forced to accept it as their own existence is haplessly erased. </p>",

We want you to thrive, even if we know that one day soon you&apos;ll be leaving us both behind here.&quot;</p>",

I&apos;ll dream of us as if sleep can bridge our lifelines. And at the end of it all, I&apos;ll think of you every day from morning until night, until it&apos;s the last thought I ever have, I swear it!&quot;</p>",

You give me so much in return and you don&apos;t even realize it,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;ve spent my whole life thinking I&apos;m a burden paying off an ever-increasing debt against all the people I care for. That they keep me around just to collect what I can give. Gods forbid, I was the Valedictorian of the Academy and I still felt lower than dirt &mdash; so entrenched in the mentality I learned in the Orphanage before I was adopted, deserving love. At that young age it might have been hard for you to show it, when I was just another adult telling you how to live.&quot;</p>",

And even now, you teach me that lesson through your boundless love.&quot; I begin to cry, but I let it flow out of me, not judging it, letting all the inward pain I collected to harden myself with to melt away. I can feel her now. And as I opened up this past month, I noticed things I had never taken the time to care about before.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;When I was broken down to the lowest point, fully vulnerable for the first time, you were there to protect me &mdash; or else I thought I&apos;d break entirely. You made me feel all the things I&apos;d run from, not allowing me to erect walls and hide. I felt all of it. And because of that, you taught me the greatest lesson of my life: that there is pain that heals.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not ready to let you go,&quot; she says. I feel her arms tension around me, unaware of how strong she is. &quot;Lyra tested you, and you&apos;re ready, but . . . I just can&apos;t let you go. Stay, just a little bit longer, please, Titus. I&apos;m not better yet,&quot; she says, lapsing into her younger self for a moment.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So stay, just a little while longer,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I will. And when I return, I&apos;m going to save you. I won&apos;t let you ever suffer again what you endured here.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And that&apos;s what I&apos;m afraid of,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m not telling you until the moment you leave me. Or else you&apos;ll never go.&quot;</p>",
        "&quot;I will listen when it&apos;s time. A brother always listens.&quot; She looks up at me with teary eyes to find my face just as wet. &quot;There are so many sacrifices I&apos;ll have to accept. People will die, and so many will suffer. I&apos;m only giving myself one shot in this last loop. But for now, in this short breadth of peace, let&apos;s get stronger together. Spirit is the only thing I can carry.&quot;"

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We live to fight because we were made for higher dreams,&quot; I tell them. &quot;The passion of the fight is what makes the act of living worth anything at all.

We might tire as the shift grows long, and at times, it might feel if we&apos;ve done nothing at all but just watch.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This Titus draws a breath. Surrounded by thousands of faces, celebrated for his relentlessness with the honor to speak encouraging words, he has never felt more alone in his life.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He thinks this is the worst it can get. But he knows nothing of where this current path will take him if he&apos;s undisturbed. His eyes flicker to that space of vacant seats he reserved until the disappointment feels like it will burn his stomach. That friendly shopkeep from Clint&apos;s is the only one that showed up &mdash; he must have sent her here as an errand. He purses his lips and continues on after pausing for effect.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But we haven&apos;t just watched. We&apos;ve experienced a full and beautiful life,&quot; he says, and he almost loses himself in the irony, but pushes it down just like he does with everything else. &quot;We never asked for this job. None of us asked for this job of living, but we were born into it. We all understand the value of sacrifice, the beauty of watching our influence carry for generations, and the question we all have here is the same.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He pauses again. This Titus acts resolute though the question still devastates him.

        "<p>&emsp;He grasps his head. He feels such anguish that it almost casts him all the way to the floor. He drops down on one knee, but it feels like another voice is calling to him. The scar on his right arm beneath the ceremonial armor and mark feels like that hard scar tissue is replaced with molten steel, and he feels a lattice of cuts cascade up his arm.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The crowd rises with commotion. Ullrich reaches behind him to grab his shoulder. &quot;Are you alright, son? You were doing so great.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This Titus groans with pain, but just like they always do, he concedes once he hears my voice is his own, once he sees a glimpse of that inevitable premonition and the whole path he&apos;s destined to suffer to get there.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus? Are you alright?&quot; Ullrich asks. &quot;What happened this time?&quot;</p>",

Twelve or more of them were too late. The rest were the ones I saved that gave their lives to protect me, yet they don&apos;t even know what might await them. Towards the back are the two cadets that killed Lyra and I in Victory Row.

        "<p>&emsp;She&apos;s speechless. But I&apos;m short on time, and this is the only way I can prove it to her. All I needed was the means, because I&apos;ve rehearsed the words enough times.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m here because I need you to believe me when I say the next unthinkable string of words.&quot; She still refuses to speak, covering her head with her hat, paralyzed with too much humiliation to be angry. &quot;In another life I was here in this cellar, where you told me everything. I&apos;m aware of it all. Your spiteful mother. Your bastard father.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m here to tell you I was wrong in not asking you to come with me beyond the walls. I need you to travel with me, because there&apos;s only so much I can do alone, and I&apos;ve got something to show you that will change your life forever.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You have my help, though I&apos;m not sure what I can do,&quot; Valentina says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then meet me tomorrow morning at Clint&apos;s trade building, before the sun rise and right after the Seminary bell.&quot;</p>",

Either she&apos;s riled up to get to school, so excited about meeting a friend or show-and-tell that I have to force her to eat, and other times, she&apos;s still sleeping, and I have to feed her and nearly drag her out the door.

My first thought is to check the window, but as soon as I notice the curtains don&apos;t dance, I know the window is shut. My fingers trace the top of the window. Locked. And when I scour around her room, her school bag is missing from the spot it usually sits.</p>",

It reminded me too much of something I could never have again, and letting those things go&mdash;&quot; I say, tensioning my fingers around the necklace that&apos;s persisted around my neck through almost everything. &quot;I kept the little that mattered. Just enough.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;She screams.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You can have as much of this as you like!&quot; I shout, tickling her as I wag my tongue above her face. She screams and jolts in laughter every time I poke her sides, though I only hold her down harder, making her laugh even more.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She headbutts me when I tickle beneath her armpit, and I fall back, stunned.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, Gods, I am so sorry,&quot; she says, drawing deep breaths after losing them all to fits of convulsive howling. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m fine,&quot; I say, holding my hand into the bright rays of Lighttime that filter through the window: dragging my hand against my nose a couple times, only to find there&apos;s no red.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, hush.&quot;</p>",

Ryder died thinking you were gone. And me, Gods be damned, I lived on in your name, only to find you&apos;re hiding out here the whole time? And after all this time...&quot; He pauses, trying to channel his spiteful rage into a string of words. &quot;After all this time, you and the First Red left us there to protect nothing?

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Son.&quot; Commander Zebal purses his lips as he approaches his youngest. &quot;Son, you&apos;ve done a service to the future of Humanity,&quot; he says. &quot;The Carmine of Blackwater are the reason we could get this far.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The value of your work saves the lives of good people.&quot;</p>",

I look at the statue that immortalizes him, and every morning I stand in its shadow. It feels like it&apos;s never enough.&quot; His voice now trembles. It&apos;s seeing the mannerisms of someone he thought he had forgotten so long ago that grips him with such an inescapable weakness, where his brawn is no match.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ve done enough, son. The Carmine has done enough. And it&apos;s done everything it&apos;s had to,&quot; he replied.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He embraces his last living son. He weeps for the death of Ryder&mdash; a sense of guilt nagging him in his utter yet forced lack of awareness. &quot;I want you to never forget that I&apos;m proud of you,&quot; he says, &quot;and I always will be. The chance to see my son again is a beautiful gift.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The corners of Romin&apos;s mouth stretch across his face, and a certain glow emanates from his chest, thawing the stillness of his joints. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he says. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I still need to know what brings you here. Nobody else would have this chance, but the best gift I can give my son and his closest friends is the benefit of the doubt.&quot;</p>",
        "&quot;A message. The city is in danger, and only the Carmine have the capacity to give Blackwater a fighting chance against the Carmine. It&apos;s time to go home,&quot; Romin says."

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;With absolutely nothing? Then all I&apos;ll have is the honor.&quot; I extend my mangled arm to her. If this clears the barrier preventing me from using my birthright, then it&apos;s a wager I have to make.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ve proven yourself worthy, then,&quot; she says, projecting pure energy across my circuits. The tangle of latticed lashes beneath my flesh dances as if worms wriggle beneath my skin. The mangled mess is untangling itself, and before long, a single thread remains.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But . . . I thought you were taking it away?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Gods of Purgatory have seen far too many of your kind come and pass; demigods absorbed by their selfish visions; promising the world to those who listen when they&apos;re less than dust.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That the kids are out past curfew. They knock on the door, because all kids see is just authority, not politics or ulterior motives, and then...&quot; I remember that horrific sight from the time I didn&apos;t know.</p>",

And then the scouting Sister retreats.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Whoever it is, they&apos;re definitely heading for the door. Lyra. Signal the Guise,&quot; Romin says, unable to conjure anything from empty circuits.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra swipes her hands across the air. A line burns my retinas, and once I see through it, the two half-blood Chymaerans that guised my friends in a future past take the form of Merlotan city guardsmen.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Please. Disturbing what? The position of some poor crates?&quot; our Guise says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You know how this works. Just so we can write it off on the paperwork,&quot; the Merlotan says. &quot;Three&apos;s enough but five&apos;s a crowd, so piss off somewhere else, will ya?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s been a heavy hand on Carmine children for ages. We&apos;re not leaving. So do your business and get it done,&quot; the Guise says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I find that same primal look of resigned panic in the guards&apos; faces, the one those fake social workers had when they were on edge. Romin notices it too. But when his hand unbuttons the holsters, I halt him.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t run this,&quot; he suddenly says. &quot;I run this.&quot; His hand gravitates towards the axe-rifle, but he still finds that sense of hesitation.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s only when we hear a loud crash that Romin lurches to action. I can hardly stop him when the shrill whistle rises in his throat. The sound halts when I squeeze his shoulder.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Trust me, Romin. Not yet!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No, Titus! They follow my orders, not yours.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;He groans hoarsely, only allowing an anguished whisper. He looks down into my eyes to see if I withhold my conviction, but I refuse. I can see that strain for power so close he can almost grasp it, because I saw it on the hill when he led those innocent young cadets to die.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ve always been strong, Romin. You have nothing more to prove.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;I rest my hand on his shoulder. We lean further against the wall, and I peek into the windows of the cellar. Somewhere, I can overhear the faint commotion, and then a door opens in the basement, followed by light footsteps.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can see the door crack open as the children descend the stairs.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin realizes what holds my focus and he watches with me, and a sigh of relief overtakes him. Between the kids, six figures stand past the doorframe in disguise. The only difference is, four don&apos;t know that the other two are playing the part better than they are.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s when the last cadet crosses the doorframe that the Merlotan grabs him, pulling him backwards and slamming the door. The children cry out in panic, and it&apos;s then that Romin bashes himself through the window, the glass tinkling across the hard concrete of the unfinished basement as his feet plant on the floor.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra and I follow right after him, and we realize we can&apos;t catch up. I can see the anger rise inside of him as he passes the survivors, taking three stairs at a time until his hand crumpled the brass doorknob,</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;tearing it off the wood as he throws the door open. He halts there, absorbing all the light of the main room, and when we get to the top of the stairs to look around him, we find the child lying there in a small pool of blood.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We were too late,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;We saved as many as we could, but &mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Romin bends his knees to reach down and lift the young cadet, still breathing though they cry in anguish.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re going to be okay,&quot; he says. I think he&apos;s just comforting the doomed until I realize he&apos;s telling the truth. The child has hardly a slice on his arm, just startled of the sight that I&apos;m finally able to process.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The blood is from those bastards of the Afterlife. They never expected expertly-trained half-bloods to carve them up, and they sprawl across the floor as their dark blood pools together across the wood.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s Jeremy, right,&quot; Romin says, and the kid nods. &quot;That was really scary, I know&mdash;but you were real tough, buddy,&quot; he says, and the child smiles.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m tough,&quot; the child repeats, though they still tremble, snot and tears caked on their face as Romin wipes it off with his fresh cloak.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;One day, sir, I&apos;ll be strong just like you!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You will be,&quot; Romin says. &quot;I&apos;m proud of you.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He turns his back to the sight of the massacre as the Chymaerans dig out bones to make fresh Markers. They&apos;ll have to be quick to make this exchange convincing.</p>",
        "Less than five minutes later, we watch from the darkness as the first flames crackle the aged wood like an orange hand reaching out from inside the building, cramping its fingers on every window until it squeezes enough to bring the whole building down."

You see all these?&quot; She holds up the ring of charms. &quot;This is a tenth of what I&apos;ve had. I&apos;ve lived and burned hundreds of these guises, given no longer than months for each of them.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re right. There&apos;s so much more she deserves than what we could both give her. We were too distracted: so busy with our grief and our obsessions that we never really listened.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And now she&apos;s gone, Titus! The City Guard report nothing, I&apos;ve checked over and over, and she&apos;s probably frozen somewhere. Dear Gods, Titus, if your mother were still here, things would be so different. I wouldn&apos;t give you so many reasons to hate me,&quot; he says.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he musters. &quot;Yeah. We can&apos;t give up.&quot; He picks up an ancient metal tea set, brushing it off before he notices the large dent in the other side. I stoop down to help him.</p>",
        "I leave ten minutes later. Maude is gone by the time I return to the Compound, along with the necklace, and all I can think of is the final promise I made to Ellie: how reassured I feel that I don&apos;t have to handle the unforgivable &mdash; or at least not until I see her again."

        "<p>&emsp;Somewhere a quarter mile past us, the guards make out a cherry-red blip in the distance, squinting to try and tell whether the bright red is just an illusion in the muted fog of lighttime.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It should be dull and reserved like the banter at their parties: far from interesting, yet dressed in gold and far over-the-top.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;In the name of the Upper Gods, stop your carriage!&quot; They yell. But Valentina keeps the speed of the motorcar steady. &quot;Are you sure about this?&quot; Sylvia asks, sitting next to me in the back.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;By Gods above, loud I said. I meant it!&quot; Valentina orders.&quot;This is a message. They won&apos;t get out of the house for me through diplomacy. Trust me &mdash; I&apos;ve tried it so many times.&quot;</p>",

We let her stay in the cellar with the rats, though this cockroach persisted to tarnish our property with her putrefied presence,&quot; she says, spitting every letter. &quot;We should have the Royal Guard noose her up after we drag her from the lift!&quot;</p>",

And I knew what you wanted me to do, and I complied, and you relished in every moment of my suffering.&quot; She rubs the space between her back and rear. &quot;You let me bleed until I passed out from the shock, and only then, did you let the caretakers tend to my self-inflicted wounds.&quot;</p>",

She pauses to calmly draw the words like an archer. &quot;So if you want to release me from your burdens, to stop me leeching from the rightful blood I share of this family, then grant me one final request, and I will change my name and never return.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No, Val, please,&quot; Vera says. &quot;Vince, she&apos;s your daughter! You can&apos;t let this happen . . . don&apos;t you have any love in your heart for her besides your cowardice?&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;Vince, Victoria, and Vera let out an audible grunt of confusion. They expected hush money, buyout from the Academy, anything else than what she offers, so much that it leads them all to laughter.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t want us to go to a . . . party? That&apos;s it? That&apos;s preposterous!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; Valentina says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But why?&quot; asks Vincent.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because I forgive you. And though you might not love me the way I love you, I still want you to live.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re not making any sense,&quot; Victoria says, &quot;is that a threat?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Check beneath the lift you said you&apos;d drag me from. The Afterlife conspires to wipe out every family of the Merlot. They never wanted you to get to the top in the first place.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Vermillion Merlot are a faithful conduit of both worship and stability. What you say is just obfuscating slander,&quot; Victoria says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then check beneath the lift. Write me off with nothing, I don&apos;t care anymore,&quot; Valentina says, &quot;but you&apos;ll regret it if you don&apos;t look.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Victoria calls to one of the house&apos;s stewards, and demands they assemble a team to go and look. We stand in silence for nearly thirty minutes. It&apos;s long enough that the anxiety begins to crawl into my mind, worrying about how much has changed, if after all this time my prophetic visions have left Valentina out to dry.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;How would you know this? Did you plant it there, just to save the day, to prove a point?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t have access. You lock the doors of the cellar so I can only come through the drainage tunnel. In Khiras&apos; name, I had to smash a car through the gate just to get in!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Well you better hope you&apos;re right,&quot; Victoria says, as Vince and Vera approach the window. A commotion travels up the stairs, getting louder as it climbs from level to level, and somewhere beyond the window, the cooks and custodians flood out of the house onto the back lawn. The nervous cadet from earlier breaks the doorway with a steel weldment in his hands, and I recognize the etchings on the side from the debris that crushed Valentina.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Found it.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s inactive,&quot; he says. &quot;The detonator line was attached. It would have started several moments after you activated the lift, but now it&apos;s just a brick of Essence,&quot; he says, tossing the heavy container in his hands before he drops it on the floor, giving everyone a start as Vince nearly flips over the desk.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I should have you fired, boy!&quot; Vince says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry. Very sorry,&quot; he replies, cradling the improvised explosive like a child now.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Well, who planted it, then?&quot; Vera asks. Vince nervously approaches, making the brick look small as he turns it over in his large hands.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I deal with trading a lot of what this province produces. This is high-carbon steel. No witness marks. Far too nice for an improvised dirty bomb by the Carmine, yet it looks just like what they might try to make.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And all the Essence in there, mixed with saltpeter. Do the Carmine even have that much dead Essence to throw away like this?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina withdraws her tattered bag that survived the crash. &quot;And now that you&apos;re beginning to discover the nature of who did this . . . here&apos;s the tattered uniforms of four impostors using your name to try to kill Carmine children.&quot; She places them across the desk: the details indistinguishable from our district&apos;a Merlotan City Guard. &quot;They were trying to start a street war. But we stopped them first.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Vera asks, &quot;And this &apos;they&apos; is . . .&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Afterlife,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;Their final mission was never about stability. It&apos;s to harvest their field of souls as crops &mdash; whether loyal or indifferent &mdash; to bring back the glory of another golden age. All they see is as is Essence.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Pray tell, and in this theory, what would they get by destroying us?&quot; Victoria asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The instability they need to wipe us out completely, while we&apos;re too busy fighting each other.&quot; Valentina nods to me. I rehearsed these words with her before, preparing for diplomacy that didn&apos;t involve destroying property. I made the choice to believe in her, and I&apos;m proud of her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Vince sets down the dormant explosive, commanding one of his attendants to take it far away. &quot;Thank you. Daughter,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The words don&apos;t do much for Valentina, but she nods. Victoria is still too distraught with surprise to react.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The Carmine are aware of this farce, too,&quot; Valentina tells them. &quot;They hold an open table with your seats in place. Stay too much longer here &mdash; don&apos;t take that lift &mdash; and the Afterlife will wonder how you got the best of them. Take the lift without the explosive, and they&apos;ll find another way to do the job.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So what are you saying, daughter?&quot; Vince asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m saying the enemy of your enemy might be the only friend you have now,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;And they&apos;re waiting for you.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You finally . . . came home,&quot; I say, and she rises from her chair at the words, quick to approach and comfort me, just as I know she did before to her widowed lover.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll never be able to apologize enough for what I had to do. I was made. I was called back to serve the First Red as its messenger.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I should be elated like Romin was in finding his estranged father, but I find my feelings of hope and peace curdle to bitterness.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My mother senses my reluctance. &quot;I don&apos;t expect you to forgive me for how I left you, but I had to.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not that,&quot; I tell her, and when I look at the empty place-setting across the table with the pillow on the seat, I can feel that relentless anxiety hunt me down. Clint&apos;s the only one out of all of us that has no idea what&apos;s coming. Moira&apos;s the only one that can fully empathize as a member of the Carmine, unless Sylvia truly remembers what happened to us in those past lives.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I can feel that impermanence, too. But it&apos;s better to have happened in the first place than to never have happened at all. I just wish that . . .&quot; Her words dampen when her eyes fall to the empty place setting. &quot;I wish the beautiful daughter of ours didn&apos;t have to suffer.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And we&apos;re going to make them pay,&quot; I insist.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But at what cost?&quot; Sylvia asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;At the cost of whatever it takes. Or else we&apos;ll never be free,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What, you think this is some kind of conspiracy nonsense?&quot; Clint asks. &quot;I loathe the golden cunts of the Afterlife&mdash;&quot; He looks to Moira. &quot;Sorry. As much as the next guy, but this?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s happening, and it&apos;s very real,&quot; I tell him. &quot;The Afterlife took Ellie, because she has Divine Blood inside her, and is capable of becoming the Mask of the Humans and Chymaera.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What are you talking about? I don&apos;t have divine blood,&quot; Clint says. &quot;And Moira isn&apos;t anything special.&quot; She glares at him again. &quot;Genetically. I mean, love, you&apos;re special in other ways.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s because I&apos;m a Chymaeran,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Chymaerans don&apos;t exist in Blackwater. Maybe not even anywhere,&quot; Clint argues.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then watch.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Moira lifts the ring of guise tokens from her pocket, withdrawing a weathered one. I notice the pendant of my necklace is now around her ring. In an instant, her flesh grows obsidian and her mass coalesces into a shorter figure, taking on the guise of the older woman that helped in Clint&apos;s shop.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;There was a reason I was drawn to work there. Memories fade from guise to guise, and when you lose a marker, everything fades away to your conscious mind. But instinct is the proof that they still persist somewhere.&quot; She takes the token of my necklace between her fingers and changes back in mere seconds to the face I recognize, looking as if she hasn&apos;t aged a day.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then why didn&apos;t you say anything to me?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I was afraid to break the perfect life we had. If anyone knew that I was a Chymaeran, or a messenger of the First Red, it would risk everything. We were never meant to hold a guise for longer than months. And to hold it for so many years...&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So Chymaerans&apos; guises don&apos;t age, then,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We can only hold a snapshot,&quot; she says. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And when I realize it, the bile rises in my stomach and the meal before me becomes unpalatable. I&apos;m afraid to ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;When did it happen, then,&quot; Clint says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint. Don&apos;t ruin this,&quot; Moira says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You-you look exactly like the picture we took after Ellie was born, and I&apos;ve looked at that picture every day, committed it to memory more than the back of my hand,&quot; Clint says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Please,&quot; she pleads.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So when, then? When did it happen?&quot; She almost becomes a stranger to him when he grabs her shirt, yet he can&apos;t quite get there. &quot;Was it before or after? You said you were infertile after we met, after we fell in love, yet...&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;She was,&quot; Moira says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Clint says, &quot;Then when&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Did you kill her?&quot; I finish. The genetic fury floods in our veins, and only Sylvia can hold me back. The memory of recent events returns as the surprise fades. &quot;I saw her, dead, in Everett&apos;s basement. I saw her skeleton. My foot crunched her dry ribs!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It wasn&apos;t like that, I promise. I did nothing!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;So why, then? Why did my real mother die?&quot; The word real injures her, hitting so hard it glances off of Clint. &quot;I saw Everett&apos;s basement, all those horrific instruments, memories of a time he tried to make me forget, so why? Why did he do that to me, and why did you allow it?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It was all to save Blackwater. All of this.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What did he do to you, son?&quot; asks Clint.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She says, &quot;It was because you were the only source of divinity he could use.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Titus, what did he do?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Use?&quot; I ask. &quot;My mother loved me for who I was. She was the only one who ever truly loved me! Never a Chymaeran who killed her to take her identity. I was gods-damn right to believe love could never be unconditional.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But I didn&apos;t kill her. It was Everett,&quot; she finally admits, &quot;and he went through with it before I could even decide. The self-hatred and regret consumed that man faster than the Chymaeran Curse ever could. You know why he got it? Because I gave it to him. He showed me what he had done. He told me to continue, to finish the job. So I punished him. And to pick up the consequence of his selfishness, I decided to take her identity.&quot; She doesn&apos;t cry, but she bends her neck to glance down just past my feet. &quot;So many identities, Titus. I buried myself with so many other faces to try to forget all those years since I disappeared, thinking myself unworthy, and the guilt pains me to this day.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I don&apos;t respond. I don&apos;t tear up, either. I feel myself retreat to that same numb headspace my circumstances created for me, all those years when she was absent, when I thanklessly picked up all the slack of Clint&apos;s failures.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But I felt all the feelings she did. I was just foolish to think I could be anything close to what she was. I was Moira for so many years that I internalized every piece of her, and I could feel it. I felt her take over. I felt her understanding. And I actually became her. I am her,&quot; she says, &quot;I am every part a continuation of her, and I love you just as unconditionally as she ever did.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then why weren&apos;t you there,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because the Pureblood Chymaerans would have caught me. And I was, Titus! I took the faces of everyone around you, of all the ones you least expected. Every chance I had, on every mission.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then what do you remember?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I remember watching you care for your sister every night that you could. Walking her to school. How hard you studied in academics and fought on the training field, and I watched as long as I could, until the list of guises since dragged on more and more, and my memory was fragmented with so many voices of the dead, unable to do anything, locked out of a relationship with the people I love...&quot; She trails off.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Ellie.&quot; Clint&apos;s voice wavers. &quot;Is she even&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes. Absolutely, yes,&quot; Moira says. &quot;She&apos;s every ounce of you as much as she is me. She&apos;s truly your daughter.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then what about my blood?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Exactly,&quot; Clint says. &quot;What did Everett do to him?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Distilled for the Pure Essence. Everett knew you were Fletcher. He found you out there. He said it was as if you could sense him coming from beyond time, waiting in the Reservoir. When he returned to that site you appeared to him. Resurrected, expending your right to the Masks of Life and Death with the power of the divine, so you could come back and resist the laws of nature. You lost it in that sacrifice. So someone else had to carry the power of both sides.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Both sides,&quot; I repeat. &quot;Then that means...&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re half Chymaeran. Just like Ellie,&quot; she says. &quot;You have the true Royal blood on both sides. The Human royalty of Ullrich mixed with the Chymaeran royalty of Eaudicroux, the escaped princess known to the Humans as Evella.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My body feels foreign to me when I look at my hands. The room spins as I gasp for breath, and I sit at the table.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And Everett infused me with that pure Essence containing  the divinity of both sides, day after day, telling me that next guise was just another accidental casualty, until I realized that day that she was still alive, that grief-stricken Everett never planned for an accident.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I remember the records Lyra and I found in the basement: the names scrawled on them in a single letter.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So what, then? Where does that leave us?&quot; I ask, and it&apos;s all I can manage, staring at the uneaten meal before us.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We still have a mission. It&apos;s what it&apos;s been this whole time, for all of us,&quot; Moira says. &quot;We have to save Blackwater. Your actions beyond the walls bought us this last chance. And all we have to do now is to see it through.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Clint slumps in the chair on the other side of the table. Sylvia sits there in silence, still too afraid to enter our feud.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Just know that I love you, and I&apos;m so infinitely proud of the man you&apos;ve become. Caring for Ellie and Clint since I left. Courting this beautiful woman as your girlfriend,&quot; she says, motioning to Sylvia who blushes.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I always imagined telling you how hard it was, what you would say to me, how you might comfort me. That&apos;s what gave me the strength, imagining you&apos;d return,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "&quot;Let&apos;s enjoy this meal before it goes from lukewarm to cold,&quot; Moira says. Our eyes all drag to the empty place setting in the absence of words, feeling as if it absorbs all the color in the room: waiting, and maybe hoping, the small girl might lift herself from some hiding place under the table and join us for our last meal."

        "<p>&emsp;I hear Clint&apos;s voice drop when Sylvia and I head outside. I know he now unloads the weight of all that suffering he held for years with the only one he can ever do it with. She&apos;s no longer trapped behind glass in a memory, forcing him to remember the sound of her voice like an endless game of telephone. She&apos;s in there now, and still listening, however long it takes to ease years of her widowed husband&apos;s pain.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It terrifies me that they both agreed to join the fight. The cold is the only thing that can satiate the pit in my stomach, but it tells me I&apos;m attached to that promise that this is the last chance. I pray the lights might just stay dark forever; that my father&apos;s relieving happiness never ends; that the sensation of Sylvia&apos;s hand warming mine might last forever, but Ellie&apos;s promise still haunts me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My stomach curdles on little substance, enough that the acid rises, burning with each level it climbs. Our hands grasp the chipped railing worn by decades of relentless storms. We watch together as Darktime floods the streets like Endogeny, and despite her height, it looks like she struggles to reach the next string of words.

I&apos;m sure the other side of me has been around forever, but I couldn&apos;t see anything more. Like looking into the streetlights as snow falls in your eyes&mdash;&quot; Sylvia says, as she points to the amber smudges of lighttime glowing through the flakes, &quot;I was too afraid to see, and I blinked before so could remember.

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The feeling of what?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Eternity,&quot;she says. &quot;I remembered ages in that time. Other lives, when I escaped the same way I did now, spans of hundreds of years where I witnessed nearly everything, so bored I returned to collect dust on the shelves of divinity for another infinity until boredom became tedious. And I know that I did that. Over and over, and now I see that long, dark phantom trails behind me of everything I&apos;ve ever experienced, telling me I&apos;ve done this all before. I mean&mdash; could you imagine living the same life over and over, forever?&quot; She falters on the delivery of the last words once she realizes who she&apos;s talking to.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I have an idea,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I was never designed to experience this world, because I was made for something different. Do you know why the world is indifferent? Because it&apos;s driven by forces of nature that lived long enough to become entirely passive.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And you&apos;re afraid to feel that way again.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just certain it will always come to me. Only through forgetting can I ever experience life through fresh eyes, but I could see it, Titus, it was so terrifying, that emptiness, not even black or white, but clear and colorless...&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She buries herself into my shoulder.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I say, &quot;I might never understand fully, but I know we&apos;ve both experienced it on a mortal level. It was so stupid, but&mdash; ever since the orphanage, my room was dark and cold because sometimes I thought if I left my windows open, I&apos;d freeze and die peacefully in my sleep. And I prayed for it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m glad you didn&apos;t. Or I&apos;d tear you away from the reservoir to bring you back into my arms,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;d warm you so you&apos;d never feel that cold emptiness again. Because I felt it. And I know it&apos;s waiting there.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What is the meaning of life to a person who lives for others, in those idle moments when they&apos;re not needed?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I mean, they sit on a shelf. Just like I know I did for years in the Reservoir,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Sometimes it feels like mortal life is waiting to die with the life you never asked for, finding ways to pass the time between the moments of meaning.&quot; I exhale between my hands to warm my frosted fingers, then cup them around hers. &quot;I don&apos;t know. So is immortal life ever different from mortal life? Or are they just fractals of the same experience?&quot; I watch as snowflakes fall on our gloves, tessellated with a hundred microscopic prongs of ice, each different from the other. But as soon as we look, the heat dissolves them: their pattern forever lost.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Please. If you feel even a fraction of the same way, then what is it? What keeps you going?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I laugh. &quot;I mean, I don&apos;t have a choice, right? Time and entropy do that for me, I sure don&apos;t have to push them along.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But why? Even if you&apos;ve seen anything. I mean, maybe I came here because I thought I could learn. Or maybe I came here to forget all over again. I don&apos;t know, but...&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I surprise her when I grab her by the shoulders, pushing her against the wall. She&apos;s caught so off-guard that she kicks the heel of her boot back, splintering in the same place my head dented when Lyra dropped me against the glass, and still, I&apos;m too afraid to see if it shatters the same way.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Her face flushes when I pin her there. Before she can speak another word, she sinks down the wall until I&apos;m able to meet her at her level. My lips press against hers as the snowflakes dissolve against her skin, steadily heating our bodies together, refusing to give to the enveloping sea of early-morning darkness.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It doesn&apos;t matter whether this is once or a hundred-thousand times. I think of how many cycles it took to get past the death of Valentina and Romin, thinking I had to say goodbye to them forever. I remember the endless cycle of waking and sleeping in that chamber beyond time, but yet something always persisted there. I was found by Ellie when I even lost myself, and every reset, it was memory that brought me here.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d like to think the small moments of meaning are worth weathering that stillness. This is what fills eternity for Gods and mortals. Because it persists as long as memory lives.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I embrace her until her trembling stops.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She says, &quot;I&apos;m just so scared, Titus.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I know,&quot; I reassure her. &quot;We both stand at the edge of everything with no idea what comes next.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But what if you die and I live another forever?&quot; She asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then I&apos;ll love you as long as my forever holds. Enough to let you live until your eternity ends and we meet again.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll be so alone,&quot; she says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I know,&quot; I find it&apos;s so hard to practice what I preach when the anxiety still eats at me. I can say the lesson, but I can&apos;t feel it. I don&apos;t even know if these hypocritical emotions will let me live it. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I cling to this last moment of her warmth like a dying bonfire in the frozen woods, uncertain whether we&apos;ll all freeze, or worse&mdash; which ones will make it back alive. </p>",
        "I wish I never had to let go, and I hate the recurring thought that tells me I still could."

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Sometimes it feels like mortal life is waiting to die with the life you never asked for, finding ways to pass the time between the moments of meaning.&quot; I exhale between my hands to warm my frosted fingers, then cup them around hers. &quot;I don&apos;t know. So is immortal life ever different from mortal life? Or are they just fractals of the same experience?&quot; I watch as snowflakes fall on our gloves, tessellated with a hundred microscopic prongs of ice, each different from the other. But as soon as we look, the heat dissolves them: their pattern forever lost.</p>",

She&apos;s caught so off-guard that she kicks the heel of her boot back, splintering in the same place my head dented when Lyra dropped me against the glass, and still, I&apos;m too afraid to see if it shatters the same way.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Her face flushes when I pin her there. Before she can speak another word, she sinks down the wall until I&apos;m able to meet her at her level. My lips press against hers as the snowflakes dissolve against her skin, steadily heating our bodies together, refusing to give to the enveloping sea of early-morning darkness.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It doesn&apos;t matter whether this is once or a hundred-thousand times. I think of how many cycles it took to get past the death of Valentina and Romin, thinking I had to say goodbye to them forever. I remember the endless cycle of waking and sleeping in that chamber beyond time, but yet something always persisted there. I was found by Ellie when I even lost myself, and every reset, it was memory that brought me here.</p>",

I can&apos;t enter those doors again or else I might never leave, so I&apos;m the one that takes Sylvia&apos;s hand, leading her towards uncertainty as the Carmine open the doors somewhere past the snowflakes.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I make the mistake of looking back when the flurries dissolve the house to a single glow. No light might ever grace the house again when Endogeny eviscerates the streets, and I can only pray to the Gods they&apos;ll all live to see my dream. Yet I&apos;m still convinced the only Goddess that can answer is the one cuddled to my left arm, shivering in mortal flesh as I share my coat with her.</p>",

Their greatest weakness is at our highest numbers. They subsist on ignorance, which is the reason they can&apos;t survive when all of us strike together. And so I speak to all of you Carmine out there in every province, ready to give your lives as the truest blood of the Humans, to know that your sacrifice will reflect on eternity, planting the seeds through death that your future lives will bask in the shade of.&quot;</p>",

But we can use this to our advantage&mdash; it&apos;s easier to blend in with the ignorant. We will send a small team of Merlot on the lift that was meant to explode, as emissaries of the Vermillion. This team will slip through the Afterlife to open the gates and destabilize the walls in any way they can.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Raine says, &quot;The Carmine teams will rush the foothills of the Afterlife from every angle with every piece of equipment available. We will strike fast and hard before Endogeny can claim enough flesh to overturn the fight.&quot;</p>",

Each has received a message from our district&apos;s Merlot, telling them to check beneath their lifts. Only the Gods can tell if they will listen.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks, Brother Romin,&quot; Raine says, resting his hand on his son&apos;s shoulder. &quot;We hope the front lines will meet little resistance, but the Afterlife will surely sense such a surge of Carmine and Merlot at their gates.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Vince says, &quot;That&apos;s where the Carmine and Merlot demolition teams coalesce. Sorry&mdash; where they come together. With our combined dead Essence, we&apos;ll blast the walls at these key strategic points,&quot; he says, pointing at a crimson-ink Merlotan map marked with X&apos;es. &quot;We&apos;ll blast their walls with the very thing they try to harvest from us, and once we breach their walls, the remaining soldiers will have free game on the Afterlife and all its blissfully unconscious purveyors of absolute ignorance.&quot;</p>",

They will spread it further to each province&apos;s Academy, to the City Guard, and to all the civilians that will listen, to make sure they know what awaits them, to seek the courageous ones that wish to thrive on the right side of Human history and rise to this occasion. They will know we strike in this hour that will define the persistence of true humanity for now and forevermore!&quot;</p>",

I&apos;d have you wear that tacky outfit you wore yesterday, but it got a little too tattered, so I&apos;ve got something else for you.&quot; He hands me another set of clothes. &quot;This was made by one of our finest seamstresses before she died, to eventually be tailored to my son Virgil once he stopped growing. But this world won&apos;t hold long enough for that tradition to stay relevant.&quot;</p>",

Our father is far too busy right now to be dealing with the Merlot,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;I can&apos;t miss a chance to strike at him when I&apos;ve missed every other opportunity. I need to pay off the chance you gave me to live,&quot; she says.</p>",

And though we have no idea what it holds, we&apos;ll take whatever chance we can to give our friends at the walls the help they need.&quot; Vera places the hat atop her sister&apos;s head, and Valentina adjusts it.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;It takes a couple breaths before I grab the clothes in front of me. I&apos;m still on the best path. This is the best I can do. I reach for Virgil&apos;s untailored outfit as the Merlotan seamstresses take dimensions, ready to shape me from tattered Snowdrifter into polished royalty. The stylists clip and comb my tangled mess of hair and trim my beard. When I look in the mirror, I&apos;m twice as refined as that lonely valedictorian that gave the Academy&apos;s last speech. </p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The countryside is even more verdant as I remember, reminding me of Everett&apos;s storybooks of imaginary lands when I was a child. Cascading vines adorn the marble structures where denizens gather in pearlescent clothes, and we whiz past on paved roads, catching only brief glimpses between the foliage.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;By Gods, how much their Essence must have grown for it to be this full of life,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;The climate is so warm.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;ve been up here before?&quot; Vera asks. &quot;My sister and I have only been up here once, and it&apos;s when we were very young.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I lived up here, for years. Held against my will, I guess,&quot; says Lyra.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Vera says, &quot;It&apos;s all so disgusting coming from down below. But why would you leave? If you knew nothing of the lower lands, I think I&apos;d live here forever.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because of what happened after my family fell apart. My father was all I had. One day, I woke up and realized I was old enough to decide my future for myself. He stopped loving me, so focused on his obsession of the past, turning into something I couldn&apos;t recognize. I knew had a debt to pay for the chance at life I was given. And I knew for damn sure I wasn&apos;t going to waste it up there.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Just keep the mission first,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Trust me. I want nothing more than to get my revenge&mdash; except for making sure he sees how it all ends.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Before I realize how time has passed us, we&apos;re parked in front of the grand hall. The trolleys are all parked outside, looking so small compared to the massive train cars carrying loads between the lower and upper lands.</p>",
        "The driver opens the doors. &quot;You need to get inside,&quot; he says. &quot;The celebration has already begun, and you&apos;re going to miss the most important part.&quot;"
    ],
    [
        "<p>&emsp;The doors open to the expansive, three-story atrium, yet it doesn&apos;t even feel like we&apos;re going inside. Plants cascade from the three-story ceiling above, only separated from the sky by planes of glass, and in the far distance, the orchestra plays to a space so grand it catches no echo off the walls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But my focus is far from captivation. &quot;Remember why we&apos;re here. This isn&apos;t about their celebration. We need to get out and help them breach the wall,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Out on the streets, you mean?&quot; Lyra says. &quot;They&apos;ll detain you the minute they find you&apos;re a shitblood. You wear the uniform of a servant.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And it&apos;s not just you. Not even the Merlot are accepted. We&apos;re all just a resource to them,&quot; Vera says, and when the denizens of the Afterlife refuse our eye contact, I believe her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We&apos;re herded into the event hall. The chaperones follow so closely behind that I feel claustrophobic despite such a massive space. The choir chants like shouts of the damned in the Reservoir, and the constant thrum of strings on a single note make the room feel like another chamber beyond time.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Merlot will adorn their houses with anything that shows their wealth and prestige, but I find the Afterlife are on an entirely different level. There isn&apos;t even the furniture to display such worthless items, leaving only the dining tables and chairs, adorned with the name tags of each family that sit in their place. It surprises us when, for such a meticulously planned event, the name tag on our table is blank. The servers look on in confusion. And when we scan the room for all the faces turned to hear the haunting music, we find three other nameless vacancies without a soul in their seats.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The last note dies abruptly without walls to echo, and the Merlot fill the uncomfortable void with applause, until even their clapping grows stale. A server comes by to pour a dark glass of wine for each of us into a brazen goblet before we can protest or ask for water, parched from our long climb.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;As chatter between families fills the vacancy of programming, we expect the titans of Merlotan industry to take the stage in celebration&mdash; meaning that long, dull speech might be our ticket to escape. I take a sip of the wine: so acidic that it burns my throat, but to my left, Vera guzzles it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods above,&quot; Valentina says. &quot;We&apos;re not here to get drunk!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m parched, Val. Besides. Real Merlotan wine is grape juice compared to this.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina takes a cautious sip, abruptly halted with a short cough. Before she can sip again, the lights dim so that only the natural sunlight filters through the distant windows.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m surprised by how many guards are here, just for a celebratory event,&quot; Lyra says. &quot;This has got to be at least a quarter of the Royal Guard.&quot; Peeking through the glass, we see swarms of them gathered outside. We thought they they at the doors to keep others from coming in, but...</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Thank you all for gathering here this evening, ladies and gentlemen of the Merlot. Tonight, we celebrate you for all your contributions to the future of Blackwater, because you are the reason we have a chance to realize humanity&apos;s next golden age.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;My eyes fall to Lyra before I realize the voice. She ducks beneath the table, bumping her head on the smooth mahogany, jolting all the glasses on the table, and I reach to catch her chalice before it can tilt over the edge, spilling a couple drops before I hold it in place.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Are you alright, Vermillion table? Such a surprise you&apos;re here to join us,&quot; Ullrich says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Damn it, Lyra,&quot; I whisper.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Ullrich continues. &quot;The reason Blackwater thrived was because the Merlot were such a fine conduit between the Essenced and the weak. So I want to hold a toast to the people of Blackwater whom you&apos;ve allowed to so fruitfully grow.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He raises the chalice as the guards&apos; piercing eyes watch every Merlotan family. We all take another drink. I can hardly stomach a sip before the liquor burns my lips, so sweet yet so dry.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe I need to let the liquor settle before I get too choked up on a story,&quot; Ullrich says, and the audience laughs. &quot;Many of you might not know me. I don&apos;t deal in the affairs of business, trade, and production as much as you do, but I deal with the affairs of the military and the Academy. My name is Ullrich Valensend, and I am the Grandmaster General of Blackwater.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Lyra, are you going to get out of there?&quot; I whisper. My hands reach for the strands of her hair still tethered to the table, only to find an indentation in the table&apos;s surface from the spill.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re dead if he sees me.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then we better find a way out of here.&quot; I look around for every exit. The Merlot are smitten with celebration because pride is their greatest weakness, and when we turn from the stage, the guards stare daggers back at us.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It was when I lived beyond the walls that I learned an invaluable lesson, almost twenty-five years ago. I had a wonderful family. A son and a daughter that used to love me. A beautiful life&mdash; and even though it was only a speck in the hundred-and-fifty-nine years the Essence has kept me alive, I considered it the kindest years of my life. I lived in the time before the Fall Of Nordhaven. I was part of the last true Royal family. I served my time and earned my keep as a Mask of the Gods, working for true divinity. And after all that toil, I thought I finally got the peace I deserved.&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He points at all the audience members. I squint my eyes, transfixed by a strange tattoo on his arm.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;All of you relish in that spot at the top of your provinces, your lavish parties, speaking under the guise of compassion for the lower classes, when really, all they are to you is just numbers.&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Some applaud his sentiment. Some laugh uncomfortably.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You couldn&apos;t care less about them. As long as we&apos;re happy that you keep them fed, that&apos;s all they are to you. &quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Silence.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Come on. Am I right?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Silence, then stale applause.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Like cattle. Those shitbloods are cattle.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Merlot squirm at that word. I heard it a couple times during the Merlotan parties as an offhand joke. But they still clap and applaud to appease their source of income.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t believe there were two classes of Humans until the day that tore everything from me. They were taken from me by a thieving Snowdrifter they left nothing behind. And when I returned to the aftermath, I saw my dying child was suffocating on his own blood . . . and it reminded me of that same day I watched my mother and father die because they were too weak, our capitol swarmed by hordes and hordes of Chymaeran separatists. Why did my mother and father fail? And why did I fail my son?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He pauses for effect. A couple draw nervous sips, waiting for their dinner to finally arrive though no one&apos;s taken our order.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because we made concessions for weakness. My mother and father said the Chymaerans could be good. And I thought Snowdrifters and lower people wouldn&apos;t resort to such desperacy to scrounge the disgusting, meager scraps it takes to power their Essenceless, emancipated shells of bodies. The only way we can grow as a race is to purge the blight of weakness, and that&apos;s why you&apos;re all gathered here today.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He raises his glass.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Another toast to the Merlot: the last tether between the top and the bottom.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Only several can muster a drink before the fits of coughing fill the hall. One woman falls out of her chair, and her husband and children jump to her rescue. It&apos;s only when I hear the Vermillion girls pound the table beside me that Lyra jumps from her seat, a sudden realization branded on her face.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Poison?&quot; I ask her. &quot;What is it?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Ullrich continues: &quot;...no better than your counterparts, you still wreak of weakness and disease. But, even through the death of my only rightful heir, my firstborn son, I have still found my replacement.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A familiar face approaches the stage. My heart hurts when I look upon her face again, just as I left her in the last life. She drips black bile as she comes out of her Chymaeran form.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And you will all be the catalysts of this change. Just as you served in life, through death, you will bring glory to the next golden age!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The panic quickly transitions from sharp screams to gargling and choking in their own liquefied flesh, and when one stumbling man rushes the stage, Ullrich kicks him, leaving a large dent in his dissolving body like kicking clay. The two Vermillion woman suffer before me, and I lament the promise I made to that Ellie from another life that stands onstage, as I&apos;m forced to choose.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I slit the side of my wrist in the same place Raine once showed me with a dull knife, and then slash hers. It cuts like steak: I know if I waited any longer, it might slice off her whole hand like butter with a hot knife. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I press our wrists together. Her blood exits her veins in clumps of ooze as ruddy amethyst as the wine. And when our blood unifies, I feel the Essence flood from my body into hers.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Sum . . . ver . . . Titus . . .&quot; Valentina gurgles. If I don&apos;t hold her, I fear she might splatter on the floor. Her skin is soft, but it&apos;s getting firmer, and the pale complexion of her flesh returns.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Save her!&quot; Valentina cries, and when her muscles return enough to force me aside in the chair, casting me to the floor, she reaches out to grasp her sister, pushing aside Lyra.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She pushes a little too hard when she touches her and part of her shoulder scrapes off. Vera can&apos;t manage a word. Her clothes fade from their brilliant pink color and her eyes are obsidian just like the rest of her, sinking, like a black wax statue baking in a kiln.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I watch as Valentina scoops the piece from the table and presses it back onto her arm, getting as much as she can, though it&apos;s like spilling stew across the table. She tries to sculpt her sister back to life as she weeps and screams, while Lyra takes her other arm to try to transfer her Essence the same way I did.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods damn it!&quot; She screams. &quot;Why, why did you have to drink it all?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s no use,&quot; Lyra says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re not giving up, do you hear me?&quot; Val snaps. &quot;Please, Vera. . . &quot; She keeps trying to hold her up. She uses her whole body to try to stabilize the mess of obsidian clay as Vera gurgles her last words, wet and voiceless, like bubbles from the lightless bottom of Blackwater lake. Vera dissolves through her sister&apos;s fingers before she can amass into anything, mutilating Valentina&apos;s left cheek with one last drag of her fused stump of a wrist.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina shrieks when she knows it&apos;s hopeless. She grasps a knife on the table and surprises me as I&apos;m sprawled across the floor, watching Endogeny amass itself with the corpses of dead Merlotan families. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;What&apos;s worse is that the children were too young to drink: they were the last to go.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina straddles me, sobbing as she holds the knife to my neck, pleading with every breath. &quot;Please. Please, you have to . . . go . . . back . . .&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I can&apos;t anymore,&quot; I tell her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, yes you can. It&apos;s still there!&quot;She holds up my arm to show the single thread, and when I look at her face, the jawline of her left cheek scarred with swollen bumps from Vera&apos;s last touch like severe acne scars.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m never going back, Valentina! The world will never be enough. Even with perfection will be loss,&quot; I say, though I hate myself for so strongly considering it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No. Just . . . just kill yourself, please, for me, for my family...&quot; she pleads. &quot;They&apos;ll be distraught. I&apos;ll do it. I&apos;ll do it for you if I have to, and it will be quick, I can...&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;An arm grabs her wrist before she can act, and the knife clatters to the floor. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s Ullrich.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What does she mean by &apos;going back?&apos;&quot; Ullrich asks. &quot;Going back where?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You bastard!&quot; Valentina cries, lunging from the floor to stab him in the leg, but he knees her in the head and she crumples.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I thought I heard you were going back,&quot; he says. My muscles tension to prepare for a kick to the face, but instead, he lifts me to my feet as Endogeny dissolves out of the windows, shattering the glass, leaving the floors entirely black as the only evidence there were ever hundreds of souls living in this space, and he grabs my wrist, only to find the single line that Goddess Sylvia left me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not going back. There&apos;s no reason to go down to the lower city after this,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He laughs. &quot;Right, right.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra stands up without a scar though her fingers are stained with the black streaks of Endogeny.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So you ended up as a servant to the Vermillion,&quot; Ullrich tells her. &quot;They were the top three greatest Merlotan families, so your friend should be proud. I allowed them to go peacefully as a final gift, though it looks like your province didn&apos;t want it.&quot; He&apos;s smiling despite everything, so happy that he might cry. &quot;It&apos;s just that I&apos;ve loved this moment every time. I enjoy that speech, but this, being here with my daughter, and...&quot; He turns to look at me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Heiress approaches from behind him. She doesn&apos;t recognize me, or she refuses to, so saturated with the hate and hunger for blood it makes her shudder.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;The three of you withstood the trials of Endogeny. You are Essenced. And I believe you deserve a chance to prove yourself.&quot; He gestures to the unscathed Royal Guardsmen standing in the corner. &quot;I will put you up in my statehouse until I can finish what I began, so I can ensure that I will succeed this time.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He turns to Valentina, so distraught with grief that she refuses to part from her sister&apos;s residue on the floor.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What will we do with this one?&quot; Ullrich asks, and the Heiress approaches her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;No! She&apos;s with us,&quot; I say.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;So you got a girlfriend, son?&quot; He asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Y-yeah. I&apos;m in love with her.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Even with that fucked-up side of her face? What, are you gonna put a bag over her head?&quot; He says, though the scarring is really not that bad. &quot;Then prove it,&quot; he says, as the Heiress lifts her from the floor to her feet. &quot;Prove it to me.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You mean...&quot; I say, but his expression is resolute, and he grows impatient.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Fucking do it,&quot; Ullrich says. The Heiress sharpens her human arm into an obsidian lance.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I press my lips against Valentina&apos;s for a peck. They&apos;re soft, caked with lip gloss, and I dwell just a little longer, until I feel that I&apos;ve been there for long enough.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Convince me, damn it!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I violate her mouth with my tongue, but she doesn&apos;t recoil, pulling herself in instead while she chokes on remorseful tears. My hand grasps behind her head and I stabilize her, like making out with a corpse.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Alright! That&apos;s more like it,&quot; Ullrich says, turning to Vera. &quot;Wasn&apos;t that great, Lyra? I wish you could find love like that. I had him all lined up for you, that was&mdash; before you abandoned this family.&quot; He expects a rebuttal, but instead she looks like she&apos;s about to throw up.</p>",
        "&quot;Now go. You earned your chance to witness my work,&quot; he says, and the Heiress releases her. Valentina stumbles forward into my chest and buries herself there, her ears brushing my cheeks, continuing to sob as she wraps her arms weakly around my shoulders. Before we can answer, the Royal Guard usher us out from the blackened hall into the pearlescent foyer, leaving black footprints on the granite that will never wash away."

        "<p>&emsp;The Grandmaster General&apos;s loft is just a stone&apos;s throw away from the grand hall: its windows open to the plaza and the front of the building, so Valentina has no chance to escape that visceral loss. But she doesn&apos;t want to. She sits at the window for almost three hours, staring at the shadows as they crawl across the grass as if her sister&apos;s soul inches towards her, reaching out to take her to whatever purgatory exists between the living and the dead.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I finally find the courage to say something to her &mdash; anything, even though I know it will never be good enough. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; I tell her. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not your fault.&quot; Valentina draws a long breath. &quot;You made a choice. And I should just be thankful that you made one. It&apos;s just . . . when a person dies and their soul leaves, you know that they&apos;re gone, right? There&apos;s one state and another. Alive or dead. But not Vera. She&apos;s . . .&quot; Valentina presses her head against the window. Her fingers caress the scar her sister left on her face. &quot;And I&apos;m sorry I asked you to do that unspeakable thing.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You were in pain, and for that, I can forgive you. Because I know exactly how you feel.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra listens in from the room that used to be hers. &quot;There will be so many more casualties if we don&apos;t act now. I don&apos;t even want to know the world that was left for Fletch... ...er, Titus all those other times. We need to support the Carmine..&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I just don&apos;t get it,&quot; I say. &quot;Why didn&apos;t he kill us? Or take us captive? Why did he just take us out of the fight and put us up in his loft?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know. But maybe he left something important behind.&quot; She motions for me to follow her, and we walk down the narrow hall until we stop at the last door.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Locked. It was always locked,&quot; she says, trying the handle though she knows it won&apos;t give, but then it does, and she stumbles into the room, taking a couple steps before she trips over a mass of fabric.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The smell of ozone hits as soon as the atmosphere settles. It&apos;s freezing. The cold air sucks the heat from the hall, and Valentina surprises me when her head bumps my shoulder. Lyra struggles to her feet, and it&apos;s dark until I throw open the curtains, casting light on shelves and shelves of colored spines. An ancient family painting stretches across the wall, opposite the windows: two ornately-dressed adults and four dark-haired children. I&apos;m certain they&apos;re true royalty from the way they&apos;re all dressed.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra lifts the purple mass of fabric from the floor, and it&apos;s a bag. One of the straps is torn off while the other hangs on by a thread.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina connects its relevance before I can speak. &quot;Ellie. That&apos;s her bag,&quot; She says. &quot;But how did it get up here?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I look closer at the framed pictures on the desk, and the faces glare back at me. &quot;She disappears every time. That&apos;s because it&apos;s Ullrich that takes her.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But why? She&apos;s just a child, what does she have to do with anything?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;She has my Essence, my rightful blood, and no curse holding her back from becoming a Mask of the Gods. She is a Mask of the Humans and Chymaera. And she&apos;s the one that made Endogeny,&quot; I tell them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina is at a loss for words, and when Lyra tries to unroll the top of the bag, the last strap finally gives, crashing Ellie&apos;s tattered backpack to the ground, casting something metallic across the floor and under the desk. My circuits throb with Essence, and my head aches so strongly that my eyes rattle in their sockets. Lyra groans at the sudden impulse. Valentina jumps at the new sensation of Essence, feeling her skin to see if she suddenly runs a fever.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I don&apos;t have to reach for it to know what it is&mdash; the devastating potential it holds&mdash; and I wonder why Ullrich would leave it so easily unguarded, why he didn&apos;t give it to the Heiress to help in his harvest of Essenced souls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The loft felt so empty until this moment. We wait with baited breath, listening to every creak of the floors below, wondering if they&apos;ll climb to our level and bash open the door, if maybe they&apos;re outside the window, if they&apos;re in the other rooms just waiting to bust in and execute us where we stand.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I find a familiar portrait on his desk when I hold my breath, and it makes me gasp for air, pulsing my heart with a panic stronger than the flux in my circuits. It&apos;s the graduation picture I never ordered, taken weeks before my speech with a single caption: FLETCHER.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We need to get out of here. He knows who I am. He&apos;s known this whole time, but how? And why, why did he wait?&quot; I ask, reaching beneath the desk to grasp the Amulet, despite how much it numbs my flesh and halts the blood in my veins.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because I wanted to believe that you&apos;d stay,&quot; Ullrich says. &quot;You&apos;d tell me eventually. I only learned hours from now&mdash; yet I could still order your picture before it came. I was so elated to know my children can be alive during the time I struggle here. But that doesn&apos;t change what I have to do &mdash;for you, for us, and for everyone.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What is he talking about?&quot; Valentina asks. &quot;Your father is Clint, Titus.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint is my nephew, and old Everett is my brother. Gods, how much the lack of Essence aged him. Though he insisted to live the short rest of it atoning for his sins. How would it be different if he knew the child he let die was his grandson, alive and well? Would he still create that monster to try to take the Afterlife down?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Ullrich steps in the foyer, accompanied by four Chymaeran guards as silent as a whisper. He drags a tall statue to the window without an explanation, as our backs press against the bookshelf, cornered like rats, as I hold the last piece of divinity left to Blackwater.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m giving you a choice, my son&mdash; my daughter&mdash; and I&apos;d like to believe there&apos;s free will, even if I know what you&apos;ll decide. Return it to me and we&apos;ll live a beautiful life up here. Your friend can stay. And when the time comes, you&apos;ll be born again to another life, a better life, free from the toil of these soul-crushing politics, and I&apos;ll do it right. You&apos;ll have a mother, a father, and if I gain enough Essence, the grandparents you never met. But you have to give it to me.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The guards grab Lyra as the fire catches the drapes.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve seen it all. You have no surprise, no avenue of escape. Our family died the minute this world took that terrible twist. And you&apos;re only it&apos;s long shadow. My real daughter, my real son&mdash; they&apos;re still back there.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;And that&apos;s exactly the kind of thinking that nearly destroyed me. You should have let go a long time ago!&quot; I feel embers scald my neck. The bookshelf snaps from the weight of burned paper, but I don&apos;t dare turn around.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s it going to be this time? Are you going to leave your sister to die? I know every escape you&apos;ll try to make!&quot;</p>",

Valentina&apos;s light enough to stop, but I&apos;m too heavy, and so I barely catch the edge before I fall another two stories.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I look forward to when you come back, Titus. You&apos;ll never reach as far as I can. You say you can deal with death and sacrifice, but can you deal with the disfigurement of your friends? Or will it crush your spirit?&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;All you had to do was stay, Titus. You can choose better next time,&quot; he says, and before my fear can stop me, I&apos;ve already jumped into the murky fountain, along with Valentina, cradling my sister as she cries that she can&apos;t feel her legs.</p>",

But she doesn&apos;t want to. She sits at the window for almost three hours, staring at the shadows as they crawl across the grass as if her sister&apos;s soul inches towards her, reaching out to take her to whatever purgatory exists between the living and the dead.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I finally find the courage to say something to her &mdash; anything, even though I know it will never be good enough. </p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not your fault.&quot; Valentina draws a long breath. &quot;You made a choice. And I should just be thankful that you made one. It&apos;s just . . . when a person dies and their soul leaves, you know that they&apos;re gone, right? There&apos;s one state and another. Alive or dead. But not Vera. She&apos;s . . .&quot; Valentina presses her head against the window. Her fingers caress the scar her sister left on her face. &quot;And I&apos;m sorry I asked you to do that unspeakable thing.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You were in pain, and for that, I can forgive you. Because I know exactly how you feel.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I just don&apos;t get it,&quot; I say. &quot;Why didn&apos;t he kill us? Or take us captive? Why did he just take us out of the fight and put us up in his loft?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know. But maybe he left something important behind.&quot; She motions for me to follow her, and we walk down the narrow hall until we stop at the last door.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Locked. It was always locked,&quot; she says, trying the handle though she knows it won&apos;t give, but then it does, and she stumbles into the room, taking a couple steps before she trips over a mass of fabric.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The smell of ozone hits as soon as the atmosphere settles. It&apos;s freezing. The cold air sucks the heat from the hall, and Valentina surprises me when her head bumps my shoulder. Lyra struggles to her feet, and it&apos;s dark until I throw open the curtains, casting light on shelves and shelves of colored spines. An ancient family painting stretches across the wall, opposite the windows: two ornately-dressed adults and four dark-haired children. I&apos;m certain they&apos;re true royalty from the way they&apos;re all dressed.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra lifts the purple mass of fabric from the floor, and it&apos;s a bag. One of the straps is torn off while the other hangs on by a thread.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina connects its relevance before I can speak. &quot;Ellie. That&apos;s her bag,&quot; She says. &quot;But how did it get up here?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I look closer at the framed pictures on the desk, and the faces glare back at me. &quot;She disappears every time. That&apos;s because it&apos;s Ullrich that takes her.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But why? She&apos;s just a child, what does she have to do with anything?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;She has my Essence, my rightful blood, and no curse holding her back from becoming a Mask of the Gods. She is a Mask of the Humans and Chymaera. And she&apos;s the one that made Endogeny,&quot; I tell them.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina is at a loss for words, and when Lyra tries to unroll the top of the bag, the last strap finally gives, crashing Ellie&apos;s tattered backpack to the ground, casting something metallic across the floor and under the desk. My circuits throb with Essence, and my head aches so strongly that my eyes rattle in their sockets. Lyra groans at the sudden impulse. Valentina jumps at the new sensation of Essence, feeling her skin to see if she suddenly runs a fever.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I don&apos;t have to reach for it to know what it is&mdash; the devastating potential it holds&mdash; and I wonder why Ullrich would leave it so easily unguarded, why he didn&apos;t give it to the Heiress to help in his harvest of Essenced souls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The loft felt so empty until this moment. We wait with baited breath, listening to every creak of the floors below, wondering if they&apos;ll climb to our level and bash open the door, if maybe they&apos;re outside the window, if they&apos;re in the other rooms just waiting to bust in and execute us where we stand.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I find a familiar portrait on his desk when I hold my breath, and it makes me gasp for air, pulsing my heart with a panic stronger than the flux in my circuits. It&apos;s the graduation picture I never ordered, taken weeks before my speech with a single caption: FLETCHER.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We need to get out of here. He knows who I am. He&apos;s known this whole time, but how? And why, why did he wait?&quot; I ask, reaching beneath the desk to grasp the Amulet, despite how much it numbs my flesh and halts the blood in my veins.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because I wanted to believe that you&apos;d stay,&quot; Ullrich says. &quot;You&apos;d tell me eventually. I only learned hours from now&mdash; yet I could still order your picture before it came. I was so elated to know my children can be alive during the time I struggle here. But that doesn&apos;t change what I have to do &mdash;for you, for us, and for everyone.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What is he talking about?&quot; Valentina asks. &quot;Your father is Clint, Titus.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Clint is my nephew, and old Everett is my brother. Gods, how much the lack of Essence aged him. Though he insisted to live the short rest of it atoning for his sins. How would it be different if he knew the child he let die was his grandson, alive and well? Would he still create that monster to try to take the Afterlife down?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Ullrich steps in the foyer, accompanied by four Chymaeran guards as silent as a whisper. He drags a tall statue to the window without an explanation, as our backs press against the bookshelf, cornered like rats, as I hold the last piece of divinity left to Blackwater.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m giving you a choice, my son&mdash; my daughter&mdash; and I&apos;d like to believe there&apos;s free will, even if I know what you&apos;ll decide.

I bash my shoulder through the wooden double doors. The celestial stone is in my pocket, radiating my entire body with energy as if it were a hollow vessel filled with boiling water. The gothic windows are all boarded with planks. Half the statues are covered with cloth, as if they were messengers for the Gods that might tell of this temple&apos;s adulteration. Our boots crunch the stained glass on the floor to colored sand, and as lukewarm winds whistle through the slats, we search for anywhere we can escape, or at least, to hide.</p>",

The luminescent smoke condenses into rugged bumps, and I recognize it as terrain: the landmarks he&apos;s committed to memory are sharp and distinct while the rest is fuzzy.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina and I realize that we stand within the walls of Blackwater, and we&apos;re divided by the central peaks. Countless forested hills are scattered around the walls, and it feels as if I&apos;m Sylvia&apos;s divine form, watching from high above the clouds.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The entire map translates somewhere long past the hills and trees, somewhere the ice stops, and we see it: the terrain dotted with shrubs and trees just like the Afterlife, but everywhere, and I wonder how much Essence it would take to ever have that much heat. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;This was the cradle of humanity. It was our birthright. And it was beautiful,&quot; he says. We shrink until we&apos;re as tall as the bordering mountains, and the landscape settles, so many boxes of buildings and stretches of open land coming into view. It&apos;s a massive city, far grander than anything I&apos;ve ever seen, at least ten times the size of small Blackwater.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We were so strong. We had true power in numbers, Essence, but all that was taken from us. A hundred years ago, the fall of Nordhaven crippled us, attacked by Chymaeran and Ahkvasan separatists.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It mystifies me how such a massive city could crumble to the will of any army in such a short time. But then I see it: volleys of Essence that eviscerate entire lines of the city at a time; divine agents I could only recognize as the Masks of other races; such a strength in numbers and formless familiars that civilians could stand no chance.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You can&apos;t go back because you weren&apos;t around yet. Not even I can go back that far. But the Goddess gave me this thread as a secret mission, to restore humanity to its greatest state, to wipe the slate clean of everything that should have never come to exist. So can&apos;t you see, Titus? There is no guilt when none of this is real!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But it is, Ullrich, can&apos;t you see? This is the life that fate chose before you ever went back to reverse it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then you&apos;re too complacent to know what it means to dream bigger. Your pathetic life below the clouds is all you&apos;ve known, with what&mdash; that pathetic father that was too drunk to show at your graduation? Your dead mother? Thankless sister? Hunger and desperation and loneliness when you deserve to be raised right? I can take all of that away.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It made me who I am. Sure, this world is torture. It hurts to exist, to be alive, to admit defeat and mourn all the ways life could have been different. But this is our world, meant for one shot. And I&apos;ll live with its joys, or be damned with it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then I hope the next version of you is less blinded by that pathetic helplessness,&quot; Ullrich says, casting an explosive fire charge against the top of the chapel. &quot;Now go back and give up. You can still save Lyra!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The crack spreads across the ceiling. Gravel raps the top of my skull. We&apos;re in the middle of  the floor, and I know if I don&apos;t act now, we&apos;ll be buried in a mass stone grave, though I&apos;m far more concerned of what it might do to the lone thread on my wrist.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The distant wall crumbles as Ullrich escapes out the top balcony. That same feeling of hopelessness I felt in past lives metastasizes in my muscles, freezing me entirely, and I panic, though I feel something ripped from my pocket as I turn around.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re not giving up. Their sacrifice was not in vain,&quot; she says, and when I open my eyes, I no longer hear the clatter of rubble cascading from the ceiling. She holds the piece of pure Essence in her hands with a devout look of determination, her radiant jade eyes piercing as the world decelerates around us.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She grabs me at the wrist, dragging me towards the entrance from whence we came, watching with panic as meteoric masses of stone shatter the aged tile, falling gracefully with the slowness of entropy until they nearly halt. The air feels thin when our momentum grows in the atrophy of time, and when I collide with the fractals of multicolor shattered, stained glass, they spin in place as if fixed to the ceiling by a piece of string, though with the slightest touch they still slice my clothes.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;She tugs me in front of her, pushing behind me to make me go faster, and it frightens me when I remember how history might repeat itself again. We can still see the grand arch of the entry door intact because of its shape, the light of the reflective pool catching our eyes, casting a halo around the dark edges of debris, and when the boulders scrape away strands of my jet-black hair, crunching us down to a near crawl to avoid the crippling forces stronger than a hundred men apiece, we finally dive for the daylight, and in the last moment, Valentina pushes me.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I crash into the edge of the fountain, straining my back as the trickle of time returns to a full flood, filling the air with clouds of dust. I plunge into the bloody fountain, bashing into my sister that still floats there, helplessly, and I&apos;m praying to whatever Gods may listen that I didn&apos;t lose another. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I feel something cold and wet grab my leg and it startles me. My mind jumps to the sickly tendrils of Endogeny, and so I kick my legs, driving my head against the edge of the fountain as it releases, sitting with my back turned to the desecrated chapel.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s Lyra.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I see that her chest still rises and falls. She&apos;s lost a lot of blood, but she still hangs on to life, and I reach to ferry her across the pool. I surely lost a friend, and if my family still persists, I&apos;m going to save her at any cost.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t lift her,&quot; the voice says. Her feet splash in the shallow water, covering the distance of twenty meters in a matter of mere seconds, with the amulet still in her hand.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Val, you made it,&quot; I say. My voice quavers. &quot;You didn&apos;t . . . or, I thought you&mdash;&quot;</p>",

More like peeing in a bush, except the bush is three moving cars with highly-trained, Essenced Guardsmen, and the hose is my arm, churning with such Essence I&apos;m not sure if the next blast will throw me out towards the untreaded road faster than this stolen ride.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;It took almost an hour of untended, winding service roads before the amethyst lightning grew any larger, and sprawled across the back seat of the touring car, Lyra looked like she&apos;s throw up at any moment. If it wasn&apos;t for me holding her shoulders to the seat with her head in my lap, she would have popped out of the car through the tattered fabric as soon as we drove off the freight lift.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The ambient sounds of discharging rifles tell us we&apos;re getting closer to the front lines. Ahead, we watch as scouting parties cross the road like rabbits, disappearing in the trees before we can see where they went.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;A twosome surprises us on the road, their rifles raised although our headlights aren&apos;t on to blind them. With such a posh motorcar, rolling like a polished pearl on ruddy trails &mdash; were it not for the gaping hole in the ceiling and bullet holes all across the chassis, they would have shot us right away. Valentina tries to brake slowly, but a rock catches the rigid wheel, jolting us upwards, and Lyra grunts at the sudden shift.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;What are you . . .&quot; The first stranger squints while the second still steadies their rifle. &quot;Who is that . . . Vera? Vera, is that you? Sweet Khiras above. And Titus!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The voice is Jarrett&apos;s, and he&apos;s joined by Delvin.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Isla&apos;s back at base camp. We need to get us all back together. Gods above, I didn&apos;t know when you were coming back.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Jarrett,&quot; Delvin says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It was all such a shot in the dark, sending you all up there, and&mdash;&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Jarrett, that&apos;s not Vera. That&apos;s Valentina,&quot; Delvin says. He looks at Lyra and I through the broken window. &quot;What happened to Vera, Titus?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;We&apos;re in for a quiet ride after we tell them. Jarrett sits in the front with both their rifles. Delvin sits on the right seat, supporting Lyra&apos;s legs over his lap as he stares out the window, maybe hiding tears at the edge of exhaustion.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Jarrett says, &quot;Despite everything, your fireteam did it. I still don&apos;t know how you managed to pull it off.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Pull off what?&quot; I ask.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Most of the Merlot and Carmine in all the districts are allied together. They listened to Vincent&apos;s message. And we spread the message to the masses &mdash; some of the unaffiliated civilians have taken arms for our cause, while others are escaping towards the outer walls.  Romin and I just pray it buys enough time to stop whatever drives Endogeny.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Then we have to get to the inner walls fast,&quot; I say. </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Why don&apos;t we take the lift?&quot; Valentina asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Because it will be crawling with Afterlife after our escape: plus, it&apos;s far too slow,&quot; I say. I turn to Delvin. &quot;How are the others? Isla? Sylvia?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re preparing their assault with the rest of the militia. If you&apos;re lucky, you&apos;ll catch them before they leave,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s only half an hour more, but every second on the winding roads make it feel so much longer. The other fireteam has no further words for their dead friend, and Valentina reflects their silent suffering, as if guilty that she&apos;s not her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The car pulls into the Academy North campus, past the broken steel gates defended by Merlot and Carmine, and they wave to us. The campus is flooded with cadets, brave commoners, Merlotan guards, and Carmine brothers and sisters. The intercom repeats that THIS SPACE IS FOR ALLIED MILITIA ONLY &mdash; that all the other civilians are to egress towards the outer walls with all they can carry.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The one commonality is that all of them are walking the same way, towards the Foothills, and it&apos;s as if we drove through a cross-current of pink and crimson.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Surely enough, the Academy North administration building is the main operating base, well-furnished with supplies since they commandeered the gondola to carry all the munitions from the Carmine compound.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s tremendous what the opposing factions can accomplish when they work together. I get a closer look at their members when I step out of the car, steadying Lyra as she heals herself with the Amulet. They wear the same clothes of their factions, but their membership patches are different. The whole base exchanged their faction&apos;s patch with the members of the other, giving all the militants a homogenous color scheme.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I ask one of the Merlotans. &quot;What&apos;s going on here?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Is that a joke? Get your things together. The next wave is moving out,&quot; he says, before joining his fireteam as the mass exodus makes for the mountain. I start to walk in their direction, but a hand tensions around my mark before I can go.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Whoa, there. Not you, buddy. We need you for later.&quot; </p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s Romin.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Our scouts saw you coming from afar. They were asking what a cloud was doing on the ground  and not in the air,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina embraces him with all her sorrow and he consoles her.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We need a medical team to help Lyra,&quot; I tell him. &quot;She&apos;s still in the car.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Sure.&quot; Romin pulls aside two Carmine cadets walking past, ordering them to go to the medical bay. &quot;You weren&apos;t gone for long. I was expecting to meet you on the other side of the wall. What happened up there?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina gives him the short of it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods above,&quot; he says, just as the medical team takes Lyra on our makeshift stretcher.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But we got something. And it won&apos;t be useful to us until we make it to the other side of the wall, and I have my chance.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Lyra passes it off to me before the medics can carry her upstream. The same resonance flutters my circuits, and only now does it hit me that this is the final push.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;My father shared his Essence. I can feel that. What is it?&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;A fragment of Pure Essence. More than the First Red had in the Backwoods,&quot; I tell him. &quot;This was supposed to be in the house beyond the walls. I stole it back. And now we can use it to gain an edge on the source of Endogeny.&quot;</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The true Humans of Blackwater might strain their muscles climbing the foothills to approach the outer walls of the Upper City, but to them, it&apos;s a true downhill battle.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Afterlife might have generations of Essence they stored for this very moment, but they don&apos;t have that feverish determinism of the ones that were poor, desperate, and weak their whole lives: the ones willing to give everything, including themselves, for their people to live on. They launch their volleys of Essence without aim at the foothills. The ground dissolves. Bodies dissolve. The dirt and rock launches into the air, trapping dusk in a thin, timeless orange haze, yet we continue to run towards the walls, getting closer and closer, our lungs screaming for breath as we scale the incline further and further, guns blasting, axe-rifles chopping, screams of only agony or determination christening the air.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The first three waves were fodder. They knew their purpose but acted anyway, with so much anger to release the pains of death were incomparable. The next two waves were the ones that broke through Endogeny, carving a path in the black rubber ring of rancid gore, holding it off long enough for the demolition it&apos;s teams to establish a foothold. And now &mdash; as the final waves of the three northern provinces pierce the black bile, the pearlescent walls grow closer and closer.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t let it deceive you! There is nothing living left, not your friends, not your family, nothing,&quot; Romin shouts, as he slices through a tattered limb of Endogeny. Valentina&apos;s sister appeared to her three times, but each time she blew a hole through its chest, collapsing the Chymaeran chum to amorphousness.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Our team is immune to small patches of Endogeny. Though the great Chymaeran weapon churns cadets and combatants like toothless, cancerous gums, we wade through the middle passage, so close to the wall that Romin could throw a rock at it.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Royal Guard are nervous atop the walls, exhausting their Essence to cast flames on the militiamen between the walls and Endogeny. I wonder how long we can hold the ring open. I wonder how the other partnered provinces fare in this grand campaign, whether they&apos;re just bait for the black bile, or if they&apos;re at their walls too, preparing the charges to crumble the walls.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The amulet is around my neck, sharing the same strong chain as my mother&apos;s Chymaeran marker. Romin&apos;s excitement climbs as we get closer. The central team carries the crates between the flank of human shields, keeping the precious cargo from the bile. It&apos;s when we make it halfway through the obsidian river that Romin huffs his orders.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Keep Endogeny from the wall, clear a space&mdash; we&apos;re blowing it!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;They shim the boxes with boulders just to keep them upright. The Essenced explosives are packed with every last ounce of Essence the Merlotan families have, glowing bright crimson, waiting for a single spark to eviscerate everything.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Plant the charges!&quot; Romin barks, but they&apos;re already installing the explosives on the wall. The fighters behind us hold the line against suffocation in the bile. They cry under the force of odorous, decaying flesh and sinew reaching with uncanny hands to absorb them; chopping and slicing between heaving breaths just like we are; and the more it builds, the quicker we realize that the mass is conscious enough to understand what we&apos;re doing.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Romin, get them to hurry up!&quot; I say. Endogeny absorbs a Merlotan&apos;s hand when he slips on his swing, and the Merlotan soldier cries out in fear &mdash; though I know Endogeny&apos;s toxic make-up mutes all the pain.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Almost there, just hold a little longer,&quot; Romin orders. The ring is closing on itself. Soon we&apos;ll separated from the fighters on the other side of Endogeny, enclaved between the tar and the pearlescent wall.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The demolitionists retreat with the detonation line just as Endogeny is about to close. We redouble our forces on the inner walls, parting the sea of tar like a bad haircut, just a little longer until we can clear the blast radius, back-to-back as Endogeny tries to repair itself.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Our muscles tense, and we cover our ears, prepares for the blast, just as Romin opens his mouth to issue the order.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Blow it.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;One of the Merlotan militants drives down the plunger. I close my eyes to save my sight from the blast, holding my breath as I take blind slashes at the mess of conscious black tar. But nothing happens.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The Merlotan frantically drives the plunger twice more. Jarrett pulls at the wire, and we realize that a chunk of Endogeny dissolved the cable, severing us from our deliverance.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Gods damn it,&quot; Romin shouts.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We can&apos;t hold much longer,&quot; Valentina insists, and my arms strain under the exhaustion. My back presses hard against another Carmine brother. Deterring flames bellow from my palms. We&apos;ll be compressed by the tar if we don&apos;t act immediately. Not even my threads could change this outcome.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s time, then,&quot; Romin says. His voice is calm and serene, despite everything.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Time for what?&quot; Jarrett asks.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s time to rush the wall,&quot; he says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;But that&apos;s suicide!&quot; Jarrett says.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Not you. There&apos;s a higher mission here than any of us, and even if none of us survive to tell of it...&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I cast a ball of fire at the wall of Essenced explosives. The metal warms, but nothing happens. In response, Romin grasps my shoulder.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s been an honor to be your friend, Titus. I truly love you as a brother.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You can&apos;t do this,&quot; I tell him. &quot;We can find another way. Let me try again!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We both know there&apos;s no time to think,&quot; he says. Something feels so different in him: no longer the same child paralyzed by hubris; no longer shivering in the shadow of that great, bronze statue.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Valentina embraces him as another soldier takes her spot. She weeps into his chest for seconds until she&apos;s dragged back into the fight, because Endogeny is a thoughtless hivemind with no patience for altruism.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;Remember what I stood for,&quot; he tells us, letting out his raucous rallying cry as he charges the wall with the detonator. Endogeny binds itself together at his egress right before it can grab him, and as we continue to resist the black bile with tears wetting our eyes, the blast eviscerates the wall, casting chunks of pearlescent white stone, blowing a massive, searing hole though the layer Endogeny unintentionally guarded us with.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;The plumes and smoke blow over. We cough at the white dust as Endogeny retreats, afraid of the Essenced flames scalding the ground. To the distant foothills, we can already see other massive chunks of the amorphous mass advancing into the city, gaining size with the plant life it rips from the ground: absorbing whole trees in a matter of seconds.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;But through the smoke and dust, light shimmers through the vertical crater that Romin&apos;s sacrifice offers us. There is nothing left of him to mourn like all the times past, and in the shortness of time, our ears ringing as our lungs scorch on sparse air, we realize the only piece of him we have left to carry is the purpose that bonded the warring factions together.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I loved him. I should have told him, Gods above, even at the end I couldn&apos;t say it.&quot; Valentina repeats it over and over. The insurgents rush into the vertical crater as we stand there in disbelief.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;This is the first time the finality of this chance has imbued me with the weight of grief. My mind flickers to that small breadth of time separating me from Romin when he wasn&apos;t reduced to a bloody mist, relegated to nothing as if he never existed at all. I fall to my knees. I know if I went back that maybe, just maybe, we could make it work. I could move the line. we could blow it early. Gods above, we could do it all different!</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I find the tears rolling down my face when I take Romin&apos;s axegun to my chin, just to feel it when everyone else is too preoccupied with their grief. Maybe Valentina was right to ask. I didn&apos;t feel the weight of personal connection &mdash; all the years that she and her sister feuded over title and family just to apologize later, maybe galvanizing their relationship with that continued strain.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I can go back still. Just once,&quot; I whisper to myself. This is different than Ullrich&apos;s endless campaign for perfection. This is just a subtle, calculable detail in the vastness of the universe, one small wish to grant. And all it takes is one spasm of a finger.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that I feel the arms around me as I weep, the barrel under my chin ready to blow my brain out the top in misted confetti, though I wouldn&apos;t be around to feel its power. They tighten themselves around me. They place their head above mine, right into the path of the last loaded slug.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You have to believe this world can be enough,&quot; Sylvia says. &quot;You told me this was it. You can be better than him.&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;He&apos;s right there,&quot; I tell her. &quot;One minute. One minute away from us...&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;I know,&quot; she says. Her embrace reminds me of my sister&apos;s gentle compassion in the other worldline. It reminds me of every emotional piece of the promise I made to her, to live smart, hard, and only once more. I check my wrist. Unlike Ullrich, this thread still has its frayed end. &quot;This is all just the truth you told me, moments before you left. So wear his mission on your sleeve.&quot;</p>",
        "Though Valentina&apos;s grief paralyzes her, I goad her onwards towards the opening in the wall, along with Jarrett, Isla, and Delvin, both our fireteams missing an essential member. We let the current of combatants take us once we find the strength to let go, bidding the final farewell to our boisterous friend, without a physical form to bury."

        "<p>&emsp;Somewhere above, a house teetering on the edge gives in to the strain and crumbles half of itself off the shale.

The last I feel is the glancing crumb that bashes into the back of my head, leaving us both limply sprawling across the pit.</p>",

We&apos;re trapped in the hollowed ribcage of the centermost peak, excised of its heart and all its entrails. I know there&apos;s only one person that could eviscerate everything without consequence, and as I lift myself to my feet, healed by Sylvia&apos;s divine Essence in those hours we laid unconscious at the furthest depths, I carry her.</p>",

Another time, I stab those cadets over and over and over until their bodies are unrecognizable, and when I lift my ethereal form from that pit where I almost lost my soul, I tell him. &quot;It doesn&apos;t. Those timelines still live, and that price is far more than either one of us can afford.&quot; I try to grab the hilt of that Titus&apos; blade, but he&apos;s far too intent with fury.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;And then we reach a place that neither of us can recognize. Maybe it&apos;s a future from a lost time. Or maybe it&apos;s the dreams we wish for so strongly that they materialize.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Ullrich limps towards that beautiful vision. I can feel the heat from the sun on my skin as the trees shimmer with their glistening, jade leaves, and beneath the canopy, Ullrich&apos;s dead wife calls to him with the baby in her arms. In front of me, Clint and Moira are together. Ellie grins from ear-to-ear with the tender smile I thought she&apos;d lost forever. Romin and Valentina are there, too, along with their families, and Sylvia stands in front of me with a wriggling bundle of blankets in her arms.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;We can get here, Fletcher. We can have it!&quot;</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I watch as Ellie runs toward me, calling my name, ready to spring for a tender hug so that I can swing her around and plant a kiss on her cheek. But someone else emerges from behind them: a different Ellie, the one I made my promise to, and I remember what she said before my final death.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;I can feel the knife still in my belt, and I unsheathe it before she can reach me. I can see the tar left behind by her footsteps, sullying the illusory dirt, and as my hands tighten around the blade I know is there though I can&apos;t see it, I drive one final thrust into the heart of the young girl as she cries out in astonished panic.</p>",

        "<p>&emsp;The Heiress grasps her chest where the dagger protrudes from between her ribs. My sister&apos;s hot blood is on my hands. The threads retreat from the walls and I&apos;m back in the cavern as Ullrich grasps longingly for that dying image.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Ellie collapses to the ground, choking on the blood that fills her lungs, but before I can cry for what I&apos;ve done, I viciously rip the thread from my wrist, sealing my fate in this timeline alone.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;Incredible power floods my circuits when the amulet finally reacts, absorbed wholly into my body, and when the white-hot flames cover my skin, I charge for Ullrich, tightening my hands around his neck as the Essence drains from his body.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;He tries to struggle, but his strength is no match.</p>",
        "<p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ve betrayed your entire race. You decide in the intensity of this moment to accept their sacrifice. But when the intensity is gone and the guilt is all that remains, you will plead to go back. You will rue this choice!&quot;</p>",

The flat fluorescents take the office closer to a colorless center: what my colleague calls &quot;suicide gray,&quot; showing no sign of winter&apos;s transition to spring. Somewhere beyond the window shades and bleached brick walls, life awakens from its slumber in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, trading the dormant golden brown for verdant green. And though the end of winter is supposed to bring that nostalgic chill, I&apos;m kept lukewarm by the hum of an unbalanced, rusted fan that rattles over any sound of nature.</p><p>&emsp;But I notice one thing, at least. I can smell the dry acreage of cereal grasses scattered across the Rocky Mountain foothills: a sense that only comes when it&apos;s late in the fall, or after the long winter when my nose is no longer running, when the world begins to open. It&apos;s when the late sun absorbs in the fronds of dormant fields once left to shadow &mdash; that golden hour late in the workday &mdash; when an arid essence gusts through the cracked corners of the crumbling ceiling.</p><p>&emsp;Our department&apos;s office is tucked in the brow of several hills that block it from a captivating view. It was home to Navidson-Monroe&apos;s Aerospace division in the sixties, still sharing a wall with the warehouse where technicians toil over our drawings. But the Aerospace team and its bean counters made their great migration in the nineties, taking their perch a couple hundred feet higher atop the foothills: glancing down upon the city of Denver, convinced their fingers feel for the pulse of the throat of the world. </p><p>&emsp;So then the less-sexy divisions &mdash; like us &mdash; fell down into their musty wake, too far behind the &quot;cutting edge&quot; to earn a view beyond the cutting edge. </p><p>&emsp;Working in the battery division of an aerospace company is like eating ice cream every day, but it&apos;s got raisins in it. A fine treat for a new graduate, but I crave something that tastes more like space &mdash; like Dippin&apos; Dots, or maybe those freeze-dried ice creams they sell at the science museum. It&apos;s like ordering a salad at a pizza place, or ordering a cheeseburger at a Mexican restaurant. Or any other food-related simile: I&apos;m just hungry and bored since it&apos;s so close to the end of the day, and I don&apos;t have any frozen meals left in the break room fridge.</p><p>&emsp;But maybe every dream is a Pyrrhic compromise between that first, beatific vision and half of anything you ever bargained for. When I glance out the surly glass window, cocking my head at just the right angle, I can see the same shimmering solar reflectors and satellite dishes I saw from the window of my childhood bedroom.

Copying changes from a red-inked engineering drawing to the computer is easy enough to get lost in thought. The music from my brother&apos;s old IPod keeps the rhythm in the keys. I pop out one of the yellowed earbuds so the lyrics don&apos;t mince the words.</p><p>&emsp;In the title block: DUNSMORE, 04/24/26.</p><p>&emsp;Checked by SAKURASHIMA, 04/24/26. That means I have an excuse to let my crush Kei look at it.</p><p>&emsp;Designed by PRADESH, the guy who keeps giving me these  sheets with red scribbles on them, telling me exactly the changes to make, leaving no room for creativity or judgment.</p><p>&emsp;Control-P. Landscape. Tabloid. Margins wide, and black-and-white lines, so the the sheet looks bleaker than the office. </p><p>&emsp;My computer talks to the printer, sounding off a distant whir six rows down. I rise from the cubicle, untucking the collared shirt from my jeans, opposite of what I used to do when I started here. Seems most of my fellow pencil-pushers have settled on the fact that we&apos;re not flashy enough to get customer visits. That&apos;s for the suit-wearing showmen of the R&D division, off in their hangar.</p><p>&emsp;The paper is warm when it spins two sheets off the press &mdash; one copy of my drawing, and one copy of the reference drawing I used from the fifties. The office is so quiet that I can hear it tap against the edge of the tray. It&apos;s time for an appraisal on my work, a second set of eyes, and I return to the only other engineer near my age in this division. She&apos;s poised at her standing desk when I approach her, focused on a model of a battery enclosure.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey there, Kei,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;She lifts a finger. I rest my elbow against the divide of her cubicle. She refuses eye contact, glued to some calculation as her lips move without words. Then she says: &quot;Remember seven and nine-sixteenths.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh . . . got it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She takes a long pause, her manicured nails clattering against the pink, wireless keyboard. Then she draws several  lines on the pad of engineering paper, scribbling several numbers down, halting at the fifth.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay, what was it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Six,&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Six . . .&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And . . . twenty-five sixteenths?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Twenty-five . . .&quot; She finally looks up at me with her sapphire rings though dark bangs. &quot;What&apos;s your problem?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Lots of things. Nothing work-related,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I doubt that,&quot; she says, but cracks a smile as she takes the pages into her hands.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do you have your Ouija board?&quot; I ask. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;For what?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The person who made this would be a hundred and twenty,&quot; I say. &quot;Since we couldn&apos;t call them during retirement, I thought I&apos;d try the afterlife.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;It gets half a laugh. &quot;I thought seances were for the sales team, always trying to predict our next contract.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re able to sell things before we even design them,&quot; I say. &quot;How do they do it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I wish I knew. Maybe we could get ahead for once, then.&quot; Her eyes return to the page. &quot;So what&apos;d you screw up this time?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I describe the process.</p><p>&emsp; &quot;You know, I thought Student Government in high school was the end of you asking seniors for help,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d ask one of our lifers if I wanted a senior&apos;s ideas. I figured you&apos;d spare me an oral history of hand-drafting.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure.&quot; She gestures to the far corner of her desk, stacked neatly with folded sheets. &quot;I&apos;ll get to it later today if you add it to the pile.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Later today?&quot; I ask. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s Friday,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not like I have anything else interesting going on,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;re staying late again?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Her oscillating fan wafts her perfume into the air. I&apos;m assaulted with the mental rhyme of a different late Friday, one evening when it was just the two of us, the last Friday of the year before she left for college. </p><p>&emsp;A memory flashes of the club room in high school half a decade ago. It was the night before the summer festival. She was sitting at the desk facing the open window. The wind caught her hair as she stapled strips of construction paper into long chains. I feel my stomach well with the same feeling I felt then, when I realized I was running out of time to make a move, before a whole year would separate us. I remember that stirring feeling of excitement when I approached her, longing for the courage to speak the words.</p><p>&emsp;But she acted first. </p><p>&emsp;The darkness of that room made it feel like the two of us spent an eternity in there, as if she was making up for the whole year I wouldn&apos;t see her, for the unrequited connection that began just a little too late. We laid there on the reading couch, facing each other, feeling each other, letting passion pass the hours before the scuttle of the midnight cleaning crew returned us to reality. And then&mdash;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hello &mdash; Earth to Cody?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I realize I&apos;m watching her lips move instead of listening to her words. &quot;Uh . . . yeah? What?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about the other three things I sent you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Three things? Oh. The redlines, you mean.&quot; I scratch the back of my head. &quot;Still in the works. I&apos;m almost done with the second one.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s been like two weeks.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Naveen Pradesh peeks above the wall of his cubicle, and I know exactly what&apos;s in store.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know. But with the enclosure redesign, I just&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Nav asks, &quot;How many did you finish today, Cody?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I did two of them,&quot; I say. &quot;Sir.&quot; My voice cracks. &quot;But I had to scan the old drawings through the projector, on the old computer, and...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Our team is behind. We need all hands on deck here, or else we&apos;re never going to beat all the stuff the machine shop is sending us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know that,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;ll&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You need to get in early. And you need to stay the full time. Like Kei: sometimes even longer than eight hours. Just because you&apos;re salaried doesn&apos;t mean every day can be a half-day.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I nod. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;You want to be on her level, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I stumble over the response as that familiar pang of anxiety arrests me. My nails bite the flesh of my palms.</p><p>&emsp; &quot;Y-yeah,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;I feel that poisonous feeling rise in my stomach, the same one I felt all those times before, every time my ambition was axed with sharp critique. The words that follow are well-rehearsed.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I promise I&apos;ll do better.&quot; I turn to Kei before retreating to my desk. &quot;And thanks. I&apos;ll have all your stuff done by the end of Monday.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;End of today, Cody,&quot; Nav says.</p><p>&emsp;It takes everything not to give in.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure, boss,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;m on it.&quot;</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"Robot Boy","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":3,"AutoNameFull":4,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":1,"ChapterFull":2,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":4,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":8,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"Final Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Cody","UUID":"6","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.2.4","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-03","Body":"<p>&emsp;I retreat to my desk to doom-scroll through social media, trading the personal feeling of apathy for a more global feeling of hopelessness. It fills me with a certain kind of despair when I see all the marriage announcements of friends and acquaintances, like I&apos;ve continuously been behind since I never dated in college: not even Kei. I had some fun, but I was too busy for anything meaningful. And as the only child left in my family, my parents beg for grandchildren like I used to beg for sleepovers on the weekends. My profile says I&apos;m single, and it hasn&apos;t changed since the end of high school when a different childhood friend and I tried to hit it off. But like Kei and I the year before, it was just too late.</p><p>&emsp;I can&apos;t help but keep scrolling to pass the time. It does little to release the burnout of five continuous hours.  If it&apos;s not social media, it&apos;s something else: endless politics; global warming; celebrity nonsense; social turmoil. And eventually &mdash; as I always do &mdash; I close the app just to open it again.</p><p>&emsp;The last sliver of the workday passes. I manage to grind out the third redline a couple minutes before 4:40. I used to get in so early to be ahead of all the others, but now I get in a little after 9:00 and work until everyone else has left, jog my mouse for a while, then either change into gym clothes or head straight home. </p><p>&emsp;Naveen surprises me before I can pack my bag. He approaches with his backpack over his shoulder, ready to start his weekend. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody. Make sure you get in early on Monday &mdash; I know you tend to get in rather late.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, yeah. Sure thing, Nav,&quot; I tell him, stuffing down the aftertaste of our exchange. &quot;Is there something before the stand-up meeting? It&apos;s not on the calendar.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The rest of the team talked about it last night at our Thursday get-together. I was about to leave right now until I realized you weren&apos;t there to hear it.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;His expression is distraught. The pang of fear seizes my stomach again. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What is it?&quot; I manage.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s a meeting on Monday, nine A.M., about the new contract,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We have that in the bag, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. It&apos;s not looking good.&quot;    </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not good? What does that mean? As in less work? Or...&quot; My stomach turns further with the call of the void. If it&apos;s really that, and the grim reaper in HR is sharpening her scythe, I&apos;d think the surprise meeting would have happened today, giving us a weekend to mourn our benefits.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not sure yet. But I promise you guys will hear anything they tell me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I swallow. If there&apos;s one good thing I can say about him, it&apos;s that he&apos;s always transparent.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. Thanks, boss.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, shifting the weight of his Jansport backpack, still hanging there as if he&apos;s trying to remember something.</p><p>&emsp;I try at humor.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey. If it&apos;s catered, I&apos;ll get there whenever you want me. You know this company runs on grocery store donuts.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sure there will be something.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;He smirks a little. Feels like joking with my doctor at a well-check, or the cashier&apos;s response when the unscanned item should be free. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;There was one more thing,&quot; he says, lingering there. &quot;There was something you told me last week . . .&quot; His words are followed by the silence of the empty cubes and the 3D printer&apos;s persistent whine. He&apos;s trying to remember something, and after a couple seconds of scratching his chin, it finally hits him. &quot;Oh yeah &mdash; you get to move into the new place today, is that right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Congratulations.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks. My parents are helping me unload my stuff. But Mom seems kind of sad, though.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. Took my wife a while to get over it when Raj left,&quot; Nav says. &quot;But he went out of state, though.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. Nice,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Off to California.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s cool,&quot; I add. &quot;Just like I did.&quot;</p><p>&emsp; &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Great,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. For Silicon Valley,&quot; he says. &quot;Computer science.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Wow,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. For some startup. He says he&apos;s enjoying it,&quot; Nav says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sweet,&quot; I add, completely tapped out on adjectives.</p><p>&emsp;He shifts the weight of his backpack, steadying his square-frame glasses. &quot;Well, congrats. It&apos;s a big step. You&apos;ve earned it, my friend,&quot; he says, with a light smile. &quot;Just don&apos;t lift so much this weekend that you sleep in.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yep. Nine A.M. sharp. And free coffee,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp; &quot;Always,&quot; he says, giving the same thumbs-up he does at the end of any day. &quot;Thanks for getting those redlines done.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I nod. Then my computer times out from half an hour of inactivity before I can lock it.</p><p>&emsp;I stare at the reflection, struggling to reconcile what I see. A silhouette of overgrown, short brown hair glares back at me, his stubble long past five-o&apos;clock, roughly combed into a corporate shape. His expression is sunken like melted wax, crescents etched beneath his sockets, and melting further every day. </p><p>&emsp;Below the monitor, a hefty pile of work is bottomless. I can&apos;t bring myself to touch the rest of it today, so instead I hide my head in my hands, trying not to wet my palms with my eyes. A couple minutes pass after the electronic door clicks behind Nav, and another row away, the gentle sound of keystrokes cease their clatter.</p><p>&emsp;My screen lights with something in the lower-right corner.</p><p><span class=msgfromdate>SAKURA_KEI 16:57:12:</span></p><p><span class=msgfrom>Got a minute?</span></p><p>&emsp;I fumble the login twice before I send the reply.</p><p><span class=msgtodate>DUNSMO_COD 16:58:21:</span></p><p><span class=msgto>&#128077; </span></p><p>&emsp; I can hear her heels in the linoleum crossway before she reaches the flourescent-bleached carpet, and I&apos;m quick to wipe my eyes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey, Cody. I&apos;m sorry I caused all that. I know Nav can be pretty direct about things,&quot; Kei says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, it&apos;s fine. He&apos;s right, and it doesn&apos;t bother me . . . but,&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;But what?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;I perk my ears to the rest of the office, to ensure we&apos;re the only ones left. It still comes out as a raucous whisper.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But I&apos;m just so tired, you know?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;The sadness crystallizes to anger, and I pull a restrained splinter of it out of me. &quot;So when do I get to design something? Where&apos;s the industry life that University sold to me? All those senior projects that let us play pretend, tossing us three hundred bucks a team to think up inventions that might change the world. It&apos;s no wonder that none of our professors tried living in the real world.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She nods. &quot;No kidding.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I thought every day in industry would be fun. Hell, I was like one of those graduating preschoolers, you know, saying he wants to be a cop so he can &apos;shoot bad guys&apos; . . . or whatever it is that Paw Patrol tells your little brothers the criminal justice system is about.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She laughs hard enough to snort. It&apos;s too late to cover her mouth. &quot;They&apos;re in middle school now, so I don&apos;t think they watch that stuff anymore. They&apos;re into anime now.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But all we get to do is fix mistakes. Everything that exists in this company has already been designed, and we&apos;re just left with the paperwork.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I thought you loved paperwork,&quot; Kei says. &quot;You were so good at it during our campaign in Student Gov.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because you made me do it. That&apos;s all a Vice President is good for.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please, Cody. You were good at more than that,&quot; she says. </p><p>&emsp;My heart almost skips a beat. But she&apos;s talking about the work.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Tell me,&quot; I ask. &quot;How long have you been here?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She counts the seasons on her fingers. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;About three years. Roughly one more than you&apos;ve been here &mdash; because I got out of college a quarter early.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And when did you move up?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She seems reluctant, as if it will hurt me. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please, just tell me,&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;After . . . a year and two months, but we were busy, you know, and projects kept flowing. They could afford it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I turn away from the monitor. My eyes settle on the shadow cast by the Space Division building. &quot;I&apos;ll get there. And to the next thing, I know. It&apos;s just going to be a while.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re a good worker. And you&apos;re doing fine,&quot; she says. I can feel her hand on my shoulder, sending sparks through my nerves. &quot;There&apos;s a reason I picked you to run with me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So it wasn&apos;t just looks,&quot; I say. &quot;Or my cultural background. I know I tested well with the Lacrosse Bro demographic.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You were one of them. But, no, that&apos;s not why.&quot; She shares a genuine smile. &quot;You should know you&apos;re more than any of that,&quot; she says, looking at me the same way she used to &mdash; but I know better now than to read any further. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You should go home. You&apos;ve been working on that last redline for three days, and now it&apos;s over. Call it a week.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s only four-thirty,&quot; I say. &quot;How long have you been here?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Since six or so.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you&apos;re a better woman than I am.&quot; Then I add, &quot;Since I&apos;m not.&quot; Then I add, &quot;A woman, you know.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Enough,&quot; she laughs. &quot;Go set up your new place. And you know . . . I&apos;d love to stop by and check it out sometime.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My heart skips. &quot;Sure,&quot; I say. &quot;And . . .&quot; maybe we could stop by after a movie this weekend?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And what?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And . . . I&apos;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ll see me Monday,&quot; she says. &quot;Don&apos;t come in tomorrow. Even I won&apos;t be here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I thought you slept here,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not on the weekends. Just set your alarm on Sunday: you can&apos;t be late again.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She returns to her row. I gather my things, throwing my bag over my shoulder to go home and recover from this exhausting brand of restlessness. </p><p>&emsp;I pass her row of cubes lit by a single light from her pink lamp. She&apos;s comfortably buried in the stacks of drawings, and I find a part of me wondering how I ever found the strength to carry that weight.</p>"},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"95","GivenName":"Tiger Girl","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Two","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Three","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":2,"ChapterFull":3,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":9,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"Final Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"7","Synopsis":"A female knight trembles at the edge of eternal war.","Summary":"> Katiya introduces how stressful her life is.> Katiya celebrates the next step of training.> Chief Aldrin introduces their probational exams.> Jullian ushers Katiya back to her place.","VerboseID":"2.3","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"04/24/26","FantasyTime":"2A-128, 53rd of Verdantide","StoryDay":"Friday","Setting":"Last Gaffe Tavern"},"DocName":"02 // &quot;Tiger Girl&quot;","Body":""},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":1,"AutoNameFull":5,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":2,"ChapterFull":3,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":1,"SceneFull":5,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":10,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"Final Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"8","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.3.5","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-04","Body":"<p>&emsp;He said that I would never find peace in shouldering the weight of all the world.

We were taken straight from graduation, the first time they hitched wagons to motorcars instead of horses.</p><p>&emsp;It was as soon as we dropped our bags in the barracks that the Royal Guardsmen kept us busy in every waking moment, spending every second of daylight training in the militarized city of Gaffesend. And every night, I found myself at the taverns (though I never touched so much as a drop of ale), dragging my boyfriend Jullian out of the barracks until light crested over the horizon; refusing to be alone; begging to forget the impermanence of this small breadth of freedom.</p><p>&emsp;Yet that freedom ends today. </p><p>&emsp;I find myself here in Gaffesend Tavern, sitting at a bartop, watching the bustling narrow street in front of the grand lake, wondering why Jullian hasn&apos;t bothered to approach me. I hate drinking because it always makes me feel like I&apos;m too weak to face reality. Before long, I realize I&apos;m not watching the exits &mdash; and the more I keep pace with my male comrades, the more I find some stupid hope that this dizziness might shake my own feelings loose. I swirl the crimson ale around in the wooden mug to free the bubbles, envying how easily they float to the surface. </p><p>&emsp;An hour passes since the close of labour. The cobblestone streets bustle with villagers returning home from a long day&apos;s work. There are four of us that watch from the window, entranced by the balance of energy between two worlds. Now is that rare hour when the drunken stupor of the pub&apos;s regulars matches the stumble of the tiresome commoners. The sun has already vanished below the mountains, but its colorful influence reflects across the lake.</p><p>&emsp;I get the spins as my childhood friend Bertram talks to Ryder and Naya, two shy recruits that would sit alone if we weren&apos;t all friends. None of us would be here if they weren&apos;t dangling the keys to our new homes at the end of it, forcing us all to weather the best and worst of our graduating class. Somewhere behind us, the others laugh and cheer. They&apos;ve convinced themselves that this transition is a triumphant victory, too shortsighted to see that life in Gaffesend rides on the results of an enervating final test. </p><p>&emsp;There&apos;s no more simulations, practice runs, or drills. Failure is a one-way ticket to the front lines, and I will never get another chance.</p><p>&emsp;I take another sip, coaxing that feeling of joy to wash over me. I can tell that Bertram thinks the same thoughts when his eyes rest on the village on the other side of the lake. He nudges my right arm before opening his mouth to speak, gesturing to the twelve other trainees behind him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;To them it&apos;s just a random assignment, no more than the toss of a coin. But to you and I, and maybe Ryder, this is divine. This is the will of the Gods, Katiya. This is the first sentence in our declaration of war.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I tell him it is, and with my next swallow of ale, I prove it.</p><p>&emsp;The details are hazy. My mind protects me by forgetting everything I witnessed as a young child, and the harder I push to excise them, the deeper they dig. All I have left is the memory of Bertram pulling me from the smoldering cabin, dragging me to my mother Stella so that our fractured families could escape to the south.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;For years I was so angry,&quot; I tell him. &quot;If I could have joined the forces then, I would have put off all the schooling. I would have gone straight to the front lines to find justice for what they did to us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So why didn&apos;t you?&quot; He asks with a smirk.</p><p>&emsp;I shrug. &quot;How could all Chymaerans be evil if there are people like Pax that have their blood?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I gesture to the half-blooded halfwit behind us. Paxton uses his Chymaeran Essence to try to freeze the watered-down liquor, enough to stack a seventh shot glass as the others cheer him on, drawing the attention of all the other patrons. Even Ryder puts his book down for a second to watch, letting out a small chuckle as it wavers.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You have honor and a kind heart, and it&apos;s what I like about you. What I always have,&quot; Bertram says. He leans close enough that I can feel his firm shoulder press against mine. &quot;But keep enough of that anger. If we don&apos;t make the program &mdash; or if the enemy breaks the lines and crosses the lake in the winter &mdash; that fury is the only thing that&apos;s going to keep us alive.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Rest assured it runs in my circuits with the Essence,&quot; I tell him. &quot;The long winter ends with our probation. It&apos;s spring now, and we have a&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My words cut short when the tower crashes on the eighth glass. Pax presses his face to the table&apos;s surface, sucking up whatever he can of the liquor and the attention. </p><p>&emsp;But I still find that I&apos;m unable to escape the gravity of that feeling &mdash; that dragging desire that&apos;s followed me since the beginning. The desire to have that one moment that validates all of it, that makes it all worth something. And I pray to the Gods that longing is stronger than the fear of what lies ahead. </p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":3,"AutoNameFull":7,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":2,"ChapterFull":3,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":7,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":12,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"Final Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"10","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.3.7","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-06","Body":"<p>&emsp;It all starts when Chief Aldrin climbs the small stage. Tonight it&apos;s edicts instead of music, and he takes a swig from his mug to make sure the words sound like a toast instead of orders.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It was three months ago that you all graduated in the top of your class. Instead of heading straight to the front lines, you were chosen to challenge yourself with a higher purpose. You demonstrated that you might have what it takes to join our ranks full-time. And starting tomorrow, you&apos;ll get your chance to prove yourself as something special.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Aldrin Valensend pauses expecting cheers, but he&apos;s met with silence. The cadets&apos; faces fall when reality crashes their party.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Or else it&apos;s off to the meat grinder,&quot; Ryder mutters, closing his book on an earmarked page. &quot;The machine is hungry again.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;So hungry they&apos;d let in women like me, I think. To wear the men&apos;s leftovers.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;S-so hungry they&apos;d let in outsiders like me, I guess.&quot; Naya&apos;s ears twitch as she mutters into her cup. The Ahkvan swishes her tail with apprehension, and when Aldrin opens his mouth to try to rally us again, she withdraws her face from the mug, saturating the bronze fur on her face with a fine mustache of suds.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Look. I can tell you&apos;re all nervous,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s why I have the kegs here, to try to loosen you up a little,&quot; he says, taking another swig as if it will get him one sip closer to connecting with us. &quot;Trust me, lads. There&apos;s fear in every class &mdash; I&apos;ve seen fifteen in my time, and the reaction is the same every night before. But I want you to understand that you are not fighting for a limited number of slots. There is not a set number: you have already proved your excellence in the Capital. And if you keep that excellence, you will join us. I mean, Katiya&apos;s brother Erik joined us last year.&quot; He turns to me for validation. &quot;Didn&apos;t Erik say it wasn&apos;t that bad?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I say, &quot;It wasn&apos;t bad for his health, at least. Without all the drinking, he dropped a near twenty pounds.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The cadets chuckle, and Aldrin looks a little more self-assured.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I can assure you that the last three months is a hard as this probation gets.&quot; He holds up a stamped sheet of vellum scrawled with ink. &quot;You see this page?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We all recongize it immmediately. It was taken straight from the posting board outside the field office.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This system hearkens back to the old days. Back to those centuries ago when the world was vastly unexplored: those centuries when bands of brave adventurers took tasks to be paid in Kine, back when the empire&apos;s reach was shorter. When ruins and old dungeons were unexplored, before we could raise whole armies with the singnal single &mdash;&quot; he stutters, wetting his tongue with another sip&mdash; &quot;erm, single signal, of a wire.&quot; He waves the document in his hand, and the air is quiet enough to hear the heavy wax seal shake the paper. &quot;This is the lifeblood of our operation. We call them quests.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The cadets cringe. As if any of these tasks could be considered heroic, I think.</p><p>&emsp;Bertram nudges me. &quot;Did this process come out of a fable?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s not slaying monsters. Or, at least, not most of them. Maybe one of our elders has a problem with rats that savaged her Essenced crops, and they might start a fire if they gnaw the wires. Maybe it&apos;s a domestic dispute that needs authority. Or maybe it&apos;s a family near the eastern border that wants to feel safe.</p><p>&emsp;Those are the ones I&apos;ll take, I think.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And then there&apos;s the ones that take a little more courage. Scouting positions. Thrusting yourself just a small distance beyond the lines to make sure there&apos;s nothing there, prodding at the Purgatory Mountains with one of our mentors.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My stomach drops at the thought, but I hate that feeling.</p><p>&emsp;He concludes, &quot;These are the quests you will be completing. And there is always an overwhelming number of them, so you will never have a dull moment. Beyond quests, there are just a few standard competencies that all our guards take to test physical standards: no harder than what you&apos;ve already&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;A cadet cuts him off without raising his hand.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So what, then, we just do them?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You want to wait for me to finish, Pax? Gods above,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;Yes. You take them. You finish them. And you get them signed off and stamped by the ones that wrote them, whether they&apos;re townsfolk or the Knights of the Royal Guard. You hold on to them, and every month you submit them. Along with the results of your competencies.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I can predict the next question before he asks it. All I wonder is if he&apos;ll raise his hand this time, and surely enough:</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, do we have to do some of the hard ones, or else we&apos;ll be sent to the war?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;The nervous air breaks with laughter. Pax&apos;s hand is raised this time, and it stays there.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, of course not. Remember when I said you already proved yourselves? This is only about reaching a minimum.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of how many?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Shut your mouth, Pax,&quot; Ryder says, but he cracks a smile. The room&apos;s laughter grows.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of . . . no number, Gods damn it!&quot; Aldrin balls his fists, but finds relief at how the joyful spirit returns to his young cadets. &quot;You&apos;ll do as many as you think is right. And we&apos;ll see how many you do.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We all seem to feel a little better. The Ahkvas telegraph their feelings the easiest: I can see Naya&apos;s frayed tail loosen as she relaxes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So.&quot; Aldrin clears his throat. &quot;I know that small chance scares you, but I want you to forget it. You&apos;ve worked for years and years to get out into the world beyond the capital, and here you are! You better be damn sure that you live up to that. Get closer with the people of our town. Assimilate yourself into our community. Spend time with your comrades between quests: go hike a trail, head to the hot spring on a day off, and listen well to the senior guardsmen, all right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sir, yes sir!&quot; we shout from habit.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, no! This isn&apos;t training anymore. Stop that,&quot; he barks. &quot;Work hard and live well. Make this time feel like you&apos;re the adventurers of the old days. And, please &mdash; do something other than drink here every night, understood?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sir-&quot; We hesitate, raising our mugs instead.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Fill up, lads,&quot; he says. &quot;A toast to your future!&quot;</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":4,"AutoNameFull":8,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":2,"ChapterFull":3,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":4,"SceneFull":8,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":13,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"Final Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"11","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.3.8","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-07","Body":"<p>&emsp;The fledgling Royal Knights form a line at the kegs, their mugs wavering as suds spill across the warped wooden floorboards.

Most of the others left to explore their new townhomes as official trainees of the Royal Guard. Naya and Ryder vanished as soon as possible. Some of the others dragged Pax outside so he wouldn&apos;t vomit on the floor, and I haven&apos;t seen him since.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian is still distant, chatting in the corner with his group of friends. Bertrand sits next to me on the long wooden bench in the corner, careful to keep us from touching though he sits rather close, enough for me to smell the booze on his breath.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You know,&quot; he stammers, &quot;I haven&apos;t said something for a while.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What something?&quot; I ask, afraid to risk standing or else I&apos;ll crash through the coffee table. I twirl the key around my finger in the opposite direction of the twisting world.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Something ever,&quot; he says, then clarifies, &quot;Ever said, yeah.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Ever?

Or just so he can scold the ones that don&apos;t show up tomorrow?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I mutter something even I don&apos;t understand when my stomach tries to transition from sitting to standing. My body goes limp when he escorts me from the couch.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian turns to Bertram. &quot;You should leave, too.&quot; He returns an uncomfortable glare when Jullian stabilizes me in an embrace, muttering something about him being mad because his parents gave his name too many L&apos;s.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess we&apos;re going,&quot; I tell Bertram.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, get home safe,&quot; he mutters, losing his campaign against gravity as his body crashes against the vacant bench.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian&apos;s thin as a reed, but he&apos;s strong enough to escort me from the pub. The air is crisp and cold when we step outside. Our boots crunch in the melting frost from winter&apos;s last snowstorm, and we find a relief from the humidity of twenty-some cadets. Beneath his bangs of dirty blonde hair, he always seems to hold a permanent look of discontent, but I know it&apos;s not because he&apos;s angry.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why didn&apos;t you join me? Sitting with all the quiet ones,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re my friends,&quot; I tell him. &quot;And they could be yours if you spent more time with all of them.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He tensions his fingers in mine. &quot;You still could have come by, though.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;And so could you, I think, but it&apos;s less effort to just apologize. &quot;I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know you&apos;re satisfied with the friends you have, but I just want to meet new people. And, compared to the city, our assignment here feels like a second chance for someone like me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I pause for a moment. &quot;What do you mean, &apos;a second chance?&apos;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, no! I mean, I wasted so many years of my life afraid to make friends. It was so easy to tell myself that I shouldn&apos;t bother trying &mdash; that I was too busy taking care of my brothers when my mother spent her days slaving away on the looms.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I nod, coaxing him to continue.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So many of my younger years I wasted. That was until you came along and showed me that I was more than that, that I was worth it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you are worth it,&quot; I say. &quot;You should know that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But do you see what I mean? Most days it feels like I can&apos;t even speak right. You spend you days with one core group of friends because you&apos;ve already figured it out, but every time I gather the courage to speak, it feels like a performance.&quot; He sniffles from the cold. &quot;You&apos;re a bird that was pushed out of the nest at just the right time to learn to fly, but I never left the nest. And now my body is so much heavier, and my wings feel so uncomfortable.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve always said you can practice with me,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But it comes so naturally to you, though. You&apos;re so beautiful. The world begs for you to interact with it, but I&apos;m just average-looking.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;re saying that all I have going for me is my looks?&quot; I grab the collar of his shirt as I slur the words, but not hard enough to come off as real anger. &quot;That&apos;s all you think of me, huh, that I&apos;m just a dazzling piece of arm candy? I&apos;m a Gods-damn warrior!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He stutters over an apology. Maybe he still struggles to tell the difference between anger and sarcasm. My hands tension further around his shirt, and I derive an odd pleasure from seeing him squirm a little here and there.</p><p>&emsp;I feel my fingers trace past his left ear, grazing the hairs of his neck before I draw him down to my height. &quot;Then maybe you can show me with your actions, if the words aren&apos;t enough.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He hesitates for a moment, but the resonant pull of our bodies&apos; Essence is too strong. I can feel his heartbeat hasten as the feeling goads him closer. I plant kisses on his neck, and for several minutes, we allow our anxieties to precipitate the act that absolves them.</p><p>&emsp;The lamplighter walks around us, using his Essence to light the streetlamps, and I nearly lean the two of us into a bush.

A few steps later, my Subaru chirps in response: one of the few cars left in the hundred-car-lot, parked in the last spot left against the tall barbed-wire fence. Drained of my stamina after three emails and a few redlines, I try not to audibly sigh, doing the math on how much time I have to relax before we spend the rest of the evening playing Tetris with my furniture.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, we love you.

I&apos;ll look forward to it, then.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure.&quot; He pauses for a moment, as if deciding whether to end the call. My thumb feathers the END CALL button on the steering wheel, but then he pipes up.</p><p>&emsp;His voice cracks: &quot;You know, you were the one that brought all of us together. You were the &apos;uniter&apos; of all our friends, I guess. And the further I get from those years, you know . . . I miss that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My grasp loosens on the steering wheel as I struggle to remember the last time I ever hung out with more than one person at a time. Sometimes it feels like adulthood just gives us more convenient excuses to stay alone. But it feels wrong to dwell too long on stuff that far in the past.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks. I miss those days too,&quot; I say. &quot;Call me again sometime before you head out here. We&apos;ll plan a day downtown in Denver.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Will do,&quot; he says. The line clicks. All that&apos;s left is the hum of the engine as I reach the bottom of the foothills, stuck in the space between songs when the vocals feather away.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m stopped at a red light at a vacant crossroads. My left hand drums against the side of the car, keeping a beat without a song. It&apos;s always when I&apos;m the most still that I feel the flow of time, seconds ticking away with the rhythmic, harmonic shake of the engine. The discomfort of this stillness overtakes me as I sit here second after second without a single car passing, but the light is still green on the crossway. The crossroads is pitch black, and the feeling of emptiness rises my flesh with static like a sleeping limb.</p><p>&emsp;The feeling of itching stillness begins to return to me, that call of the void, and I feel it&apos;s presence as if it were sitting in the backseat, in the space where my friends used to be. I drop the pedal to the floor before the light can change, longing for that feeling of inertia to lull me back to peace: ripping through the intersection before the light can change.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"Firsthand Home","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":3,"AutoNameFull":11,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":3,"ChapterFull":4,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":11,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":17,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"Final Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Cody","UUID":"15","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.4.11","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-10","Body":"<p>&emsp;A Bankers Box is the last thing I have to store away in the small closet beneath the stairs. It&apos;s somehow lived to service my family through many moves, and the yellowed white of the cardboard is long-aged to prove it.  First is the word OFFICE in my mother&apos;s cursive from twenty-some years ago. That was scratched out to say COLLEGE STUFF in my father&apos;s handwriting five years ago. Four years later, for the long move back, I amended that with a semicolon, adding ENGINEERING TEXTBOOKS (AND SHIT) in my fine block script to help clarify. And now &mdash; so redacted it looks like a square Dalmatian &mdash; it reads CODY DUNSMORE, FIRST HOME.</p><p>&emsp;Inside is all the hobby stuff I used to like when I had the energy: a mess of soldering tips, beer-can capacitors and resistors as if I went back to the 90s and robbed a Radio Shack. There&apos;s a couple games I picked up when Mom drove me to GameStop for midnight releases with my buddies, and weighing it down is the signed lacrosse ball from the last Varsity game that let me letter in high school.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You know, for a new home owner, you sure have a lot of crap to start,&quot; my father says. &quot;Your mother and I started with nothing. Nothing!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But it is a whole lot of nothing.&quot; I gesture to the lonely folding chair and cheap television in the small foyer. &quot;The modern man needs very little to be satisfied.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just hope it&apos;s enough to survive,&quot; my mother says. She rubs her temples.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just glad it comes with a washer and dryer. Otherwise I&apos;d have to buy new clothes every week.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Dear Lord, Alan. Did we raise him?&quot; She turns to my father. &quot;Did he forget how to wash clothes some time in college?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He&apos;ll be fine, Kim,&quot; Dad says. </p><p>&emsp;It humors us when she gets the panicked look on her face. Neither of us can tell if it&apos;s a joke.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You remember? She&apos;s only washed my clothes since I got back from school. I think I remember how to do it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you need to keep your shirts nice. For work,&quot; she says. &quot;You need to iron them. Did you get an ironing board?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I get it. I know, and I will, tomorrow,&quot; I tell her. &quot;You remember I&apos;ve been working there for two years, right? Everybody just wears jeans. Some even T-shirts.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Dad&apos;s face furrows at the thought. &quot;Dressing like that won&apos;t get you a promotion.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, they make fun of me when I dress up enough to tuck in my shirt. Saying I&apos;m trying to take their jobs.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, then . . .&quot; Dad starts, but his words trail off. </p><p>&emsp;The silence returns to us: it&apos;s a pivotal moment in our relationship. They were empty-nesters for four years, and right when they got used to it, they had me again for another two.  The childhood home will be so quiet: maybe it deafens them. I remember my mom kept the room and bed so neat every time I returned from college.</p><p>&emsp;Maybe there are phases to it, just like my late brother&apos;s room was all those years ago. It was as still as a museum for months. All his books and participation trophies were scattered thoughtfully as if he had just left the house to go see friends for a really, really long time, his letterman&apos;s jacket glistening with pins on the chair, and I almost thought they were planning on putting the whole room behind glass, until one windy day showed them it&apos;d be safer in seventeen boxes. </p><p>&emsp;Cardboard. </p><p>&emsp;Not like the polished wooden box beneath the ground, protecting all the things the war couldn&apos;t take.</p><p>&emsp;They head towards the door and turn the knob, still chipper despite how it drags on all of us, and my father wants to show it the least. </p><p>&emsp;I almost think I can hear his voice crack. &quot;Just promise us you&apos;ll visit, right? Dinner next week?&quot; And to make it less emasculating, he adds, &quot;Your mother will go nuts if she can&apos;t do a load of laundry at least once a month.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I swear I&apos;ll never do it again,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I promise,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And maybe you can bring over a girl,&quot; Dad says. &quot;Don&apos;t get me wrong. You did great in school, but we&apos;re never gonna have grandchildren at this rate.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, Alan,&quot; Mom says. I think she&apos;s gonna shake her head or admonish him. </p><p>&emsp;But she surprises me. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re right. Wasn&apos;t there a reason Cody insisted on that queen-size bed?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And the spare bedroom. He&apos;s smart. Put a bed in there and he&apos;s got a fine doghouse.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. The gaming room, you mean?&quot; I ask, and they&apos;re half out the door before Dad answers.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Lonely girls his age start collecting cats. I just pray you don&apos;t do that with games on that computer program you were showing me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I hold the smile though their words cut me, though they don&apos;t realize it. </p><p>&emsp;This isn&apos;t the way I wanted this memory to end.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe you can get that girl from work to come over. The older one you went to prom with. The asian one,&quot; Dad says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s enough,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;I give my mother and father a hug. I squeeze my mother a little longer because she likes them, and I swear I can feel her tremble, just a little, and when they head for the car, my mother chokes on the last words before she&apos;ll probably lose it.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We love you, Cody. We&apos;re so proud of you,&quot; she says, loud enough that all my new neighbors can hear.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Thanks. I love you too,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;I wave for a while as they depart, blasting the 80s love songs through their windows as my father ducks his head.</p><p>&emsp;I retreat through the threshold of the doorway, hesitating to close the door or else the suddenness of this new chapter might give me whiplash. A couple tears leave my eyes. I sniff. It&apos;s a bright March day, and somewhere beyond the spotless windows, the birds sing songs in staccato, coupled with the chattering rumble of new construction.</p><p>&emsp;I flick the lights on, then off, then on again, then settle for off. I sit at the head of the glass dining table to find myself in a familiar headspace, from all those years ago in college, when my roommates left to drive home to their families, and flying for me wasn&apos;t an option. In the small closet beneath the stairs is the Bankers Box, and somewhere inside my head I wonder how I can ever reignite those old passions.</p><p>&emsp;I sit there until tinnitus rings in my ears. I don&apos;t feel like gaming, going for a walk, or saying hello to the neighbors. I love my parents to pieces, but their words still cut me. I mean, I&apos;m twenty-six years old: is this the age where you start to really believe you&apos;ll be alone forever? </p><p>&emsp;The comebacks always come to you long after they&apos;re useful. I open the fridge my mom overstocked with frozen food from Costco in case I starve in the next three months and grab an off-brand seltzer, returning to darkness when the door closes. </p><p>&emsp;Then maybe he should have stayed. He was smarter, more attractive, more alive than I can ever be, I could have said. Communication was what killed him. And I refuse to harm my relationship with my parents over it. But really, what do they think? Some neighbor girl is going to stumble in here looking for love?</p><p>&emsp;The thoughts get me nowhere, but the seltzer does. And when the clock reads 8:00 PM, three deep with the gold-painted cans standing like little league trophies on the finely-polished counter, I&apos;m finally able to forget. And I forget even easier when he stumbles through the open door.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Beer later, wey. Wanna hotbox my car?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He slicks his black hair back before dragging his feet on my mat, carrying a rack of cheap beer with an OfficeMax nametag pinned upside-down.</p>"},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"95","GivenName":"Secondhand Cottage","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Four","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Five","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":4,"ChapterFull":5,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":18,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"Final Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"16","Synopsis":"Katiya rushes to begin her first day.","Summary":"> Katiya has nightmares of a devastating past.> Katiya explores her new Guard-sactioned home.> Katiya struggles to start her day.> Walk from home to the Royal Base.","VerboseID":"2.5","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"04/25/26","FantasyTime":"2A-128, 54th of Verdantide","StoryDay":"Saturday","Setting":"Knights&apos; Quarter"},"DocName":"04 // &quot;Secondhand Cottage&quot;","Body":""},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":1,"AutoNameFull":12,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":4,"ChapterFull":5,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":1,"SceneFull":12,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":19,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"Final Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"17","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.5.12","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-11","Body":"<p>&emsp;The next lucid moment, I find myself pinned upside-down beneath a thick wooden rack. The heat climbs as I drag my heels across the floor, my clothes so black and charred that I pray my sweaty flesh might slick me back through the narrow space. Within the hot box of crackling logs and scalding cinders, the roar of recircling flames makes the house screech in agony when its bones crunch and crumble, casting twigs and thatch to the ashen floor.</p><p>&emsp;The twisting and thrashing gets me nowhere, but when a log column crashes into the thin floor, the rack slides into the hollow foundation. My body is so small and pathetic, but I&apos;m barely able to command my cramped muscles to escape, crawling across the floor as the smoke billows overhead, drawing shallow, stinging breaths into  my pinched lungs. </p><p>&emsp;The log walls close in like long fingers of a burning fist that clenches, casting glowing rubies of raging ruin that spread like a rash across the cabin&apos;s bones, and as I gasp harder for desperate breaths, losing the strength of air to drive my muscles, I realize that all the windows and doors are missing.</p><p>&emsp;The heat would evaporate my tears if I had the fluids left to cry. All that&apos;s left is to feel how much I loathe this feeling of helplessness. Didn&apos;t I escape this crumbling crypt of cinders?

It&apos;s not the first time my mind tormented me with visions of another life, one where the Gods of fortune hadn&apos;t intervened. My episodes were worse in the Barracks: so bad that they threw me in with all the other traumatized children of the war that tossed and turned too much in their sleep, waking the others with the foreshadowing shouts and screams of the slaughter that might await them.</p><p>&emsp;I always think I can be stronger. I always find myself thinking I can outmaneuver it, but it matters not how viciously I fight to comport myself. That poisonous malady of the soul is an everflowing source of suffering stronger than the sea. And even as I sit here with full recollection of everything that&apos;s brought me to this moment, I still can&apos;t shake that feeling of eternal freefall, that uncomfortable feathering in my stomach that casts my fingers and toes in phantom static, waiting and waiting for when I&apos;ll splatter against the end of this bottomless pit.</p><p>&emsp;But the end never comes. The only way, it seems, is to distract myself from the infinite fall, so that feeling becomes a lesser part of me. I&apos;ve tried hating it, but it never concedes. I&apos;ve tried overpowering it, but it&apos;s like sculpting water. So all I can do is follow the words of my father when these episodes would overtake me.</p><p>&emsp;Katiya, he would say. My beautiful daughter, you have to focus. Tell me, where are you right now?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m in the town of Gaffesend, across the lake from where we used to live,&quot; I mutter, clutching my chest with numbing fingers that hinge against my will. My other hand reaches for the left side of the bed as I call out his name, longing for a touch beyond lust, but the bed is cold again: damp with his sweat from our passions the night before.</p><p>&emsp;Where are you?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m in my new home. In the bedroom,&quot; I breathe. &quot;With plastered walls,&quot; I breathe. &quot;And a fan,&quot; I breathe, taking two breaths before the next distracting question comes to me I cast a look around as my eyes adjust from the dark of sleep to the brightness of morning.</p><p>&emsp;When are you?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A near twenty years after I lost you.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s the hundred-and-twenty-ninth year after the Fall. A long winter fades into spring as the world opens again, and I can smell the buds of flowers blooming in the wild spaces. &quot;I&apos;ve come back to find something I lost, I think,&quot; I add.</p><p>&emsp;And can you describe how you feel?</p><p>&emsp;My breaths are slowing. My heart is acclimating to the stillness, and my body is accepting there&apos;s nothing that threatens it, even though I&apos;ve already identified all the exits. I must have flamed a little in my sleep: there are small burn holes where my naked body pressed hardest against the fabric. The sheets are saturated with soot from the scalding heat my circuits must have risen, but that&apos;s not what upsets me the most. As the world returns to me, I can feel my fists ball on a different kind of anger.</p><p>&emsp;I thought the passion of the night before might have compelled Jullian him to stay. The feeling of that truth feels so palpable when he kisses me, and for the hour after, my mind floats on the joy of all we&apos;ve shared: watching each other&apos;s siblings; studying those long nights together; even training in the early mornings; and all the time we&apos;d set aside for each other despite everything.</p><p>&emsp;Maybe it&apos;s the annoyed sigh he breathes when I goad him on the morning runs around the village, one of our traditions. Or maybe it&apos;s in the listless tick he acquired any time we walk about the village. Or maybe it&apos;s in his new group of friends &mdash; though he&apos;s always longed for a group to belong to, and I don&apos;t fault him for any of that.</p><p>&emsp;But he wasn&apos;t here when I needed him. The only considerate act was topping off the Essence switch with a touch, allowing the ceiling fan enough energy to run until I awoke. His clothes vanished as if he was trying to clear a crime scene.</p><p>&emsp;After I release myself from the tangle of bedsheets, I  poke my head out the back window facing west &mdash; nearly forgetting to cover my breasts with the thick red curtain as I try to guess the time. It&apos;s a commerce street,  and the stalls are vacant without produce or trinkets, the stools still tucked beneath the counters. The merchants tend to gather an hour after sunrise, meaning it&apos;s long before the time that we were told to gather outside the officer post.</p><p>&emsp;I glance out the east window that looks out upon a quaint little garden: my tiny lawn with a walkway that divides it, enclosed by the spires of a wrought-iron fence. The mountain air is so crisp and fresh as it pours though the windows, wrapping around the curtain that covers my extremities, and when I lift my eyes to the Purgatory Mountains, feeling the morning sun radiate my skin, I find a captivating view of Lake Gaffesend.</p><p>&emsp;The Gods of fortune haven&apos;t forgotten me, I think: but I refuse to ever lean on them with all my weight.</p><p>&emsp;I find the closet furnished to the measurements I gave at Orientation, though almost everything seems to be genderless. The underwear is the only thing that&apos;s distinctly feminine, and after smelling myself to ensure the stench of sweat is not severe, I slip on a pair, and proceed to dress in the Royal Guard&apos;s underclothes.</p><p>&emsp;The white undershirt is baggy, but not too long in the sleeves. I&apos;m just relieved to not have to wear the same binder I wore for graduation. After six hours listening to names, thinking I&apos;d pass out from the pain in my back and ribs, I wondered why they call it a &quot;breastplate&quot; when it&apos;s flatter than the Capital fields. </p><p>&emsp;But this is different armor: armor designed for show instead of function, for making the villagers feel safe, though the thin steel couldn&apos;t stop two thrashings from a sword. The steel only covers the shoulders, arms, hands, and chest, exposing the undershirt at the midriff. And beyond the showy sabatons on my feet, embellished with gold trim like all the rest of the armor that was never meant to get so much as a scratch, there are thin tassets that couldn&apos;t protect my hip from so much as a fall.</p><p>&emsp;I relish the feeling of excitement to try it on: anything that tears me from the lingering feeling in my stomach, and when I step into the washroom to look into the mirror, I imagine its guise before I even put it on.</p><p>&emsp;The person that looks back at me is carved as intentionally as the thousand sculptures my father whittled in the forest across the lake, carving the trimmings and stumps from his work as a carpenter. The only difference is in our intentions. His comes from that sedentary softness of imaginary inner peace, the very reason my parents settled in that village all those years ago. His showed in the soft shavings that split from the virgin bark, falling to the floor like petals as he perfected its form. But my intention lies in the real world, of flesh and blood. It lies in the continuous honing of my body to be ready for the fight that&apos;s coming &mdash; the approaching end to the long fall that forever turns my stomach &mdash; and I&apos;ll need every bit of strength I can gather to act as a breakwall, so that ruinous poison never spills over upon the innocents.</p><p>&emsp;I trace the definition in my abs, noticing all the imperfections I have yet to carve through training, trying to stop that self-immolating voice that says I will never be strong enough; that if not for Jullian, no one else would ever be attracted to someone like me. But this life has only ever been a sacrifice, since it should have been taken. I can&apos;t change my modest height, but I&apos;ve shaped just about everything else, and when I put on the undershirt, it covers all the weakness I have yet to improve.</p><p>&emsp;And now it&apos;s time to hone myself further.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":3,"AutoNameFull":14,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":4,"ChapterFull":5,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":14,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":21,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"Final Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"19","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.5.14","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-13","Body":"<p>&emsp;I descend the stairs in bare feet, carrying the thin cosmetic armor. The kitchen counters are vacant beyond some basic decorations: a bowl and a candle on every surface, what I&apos;ve learned is the bare minimum for any military-issued living space. Part of me hopes for an explanatory note from Jullian, but I find nothing, just my bag of possessions scattered across the floor.</p><p>&emsp;My stomach rumbles when my nose notices the commerce street is open. I spark the burners with Essence, throwing on some standard-issue porridge rations as I try to put on my second layer of clothing.</p><p>&emsp;A knock sounds on the door, rapping so hard that I should hear it anywhere in the house. It startles me when I&apos;m putting on the solid armor that refuses to give as I contort my body. It&apos;s an unfamiliar voice, but incredibly deep and charming.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Miss Katiya, darling, it&apos;s time to wake up,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Coming.&quot; I try to dress faster while blinded, but forget I&apos;m standing in front of my bag of personal items.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No need. I&apos;m a knocker commissioned by the Guard.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My foot catches before I can respond. I crash to the ground with a high squeak, my arms bound by an arm hole.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Miss Katiya . . . are you alright in there?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m certainly not right inside the armor.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m fine,&quot; I say, my head half-protruding from the head hole like a bashful turtle. My arms are all twisted inside the uncompromising metal. &quot;Thanks for the warning.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not a problem, love,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;As I struggle to free myself from my metal cocoon, I recognize that there&apos;s a hinged strap on the side: something that would have made the struggle a whole lot easier.</p><p>&emsp;But then a sizzling sound sets off behind me. I&apos;m so charged with Essence that I must&apos;ve transferred too much to the burner. The porridge bubbles over the edges of the pot, edging off the wooden spoon that bridged the center. Scrambling from the floor, I reach my hand to withdraw heat from the stove, feeling that transfer of energy return to my circuits.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Gods damn it,&quot; I tell myself. And when I reach to grasp the handle of the pot, my foot slips in a mess of oats on the floor, casting a plume of molten chunks across the floorboards and the cabinetry.</p><p>&emsp;A voice rises from the other side of the house: a different pitch with the same sentiment.</p><p>&emsp; &quot;You alright in there, Aleena?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Aleena? Who&apos;s Aleena?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, just a little accident,&quot; I say. &quot;Looks like I&apos;ll be skipping breakfast.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You can&apos;t miss breakfast if you&apos;re defending the village,&quot; he says. &quot;Come to the window.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;One second,&quot; I say, before throwing my armor on the right way, finding  buckles and straps that are stitched there for a reason. When I&apos;m sufficiently sharp, clothed in bright crimson and silver that&apos;s trimmed with gold, I reach for the window sill to drag it open.</p><p>&emsp;A stocky, bald man squats on one of the stools in the shadow of the building, his collection of fresh breads proudly displayed across the front of the booth.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re not Aleena. Your voice sounds like hers, though. Are you a friend?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is my new house,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. Sorry,&quot; he says. &quot;Well, you&apos;re certainly prettier than she was!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;A hand slaps him across the cheek. I bend down to see where it came from, and it&apos;s his wife, unloading the rest of their produce: they must have just arrived.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m Derry. And this is my wife, Carmen. We sell fresh bread here every morning.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I shake their hands, bending awkwardly to meet their eyes from four feet off of street level.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The last girl preferred waking to the smell of fresh bread,&quot; Carmen says. &quot;She regaled us with tales of her travels in exchange for a loaf. Maybe you can do the same?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My peckishness speaks first. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course. What do I owe you?&quot; I ask, drawing my fingers into my coin purse for a couple Kine.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The first one&apos;s free, because I think you&apos;ll make a great customer. It&apos;s fresh, with a special blend of spices in there,&quot; he insists.</p><p>&emsp;His wife turns from unloading the cart. &quot;Say, what happened to the other girl?&quot;</p><p>&emsp; I withdraw the key from my pocket: without the cover of night or blurred vision, I can inspect it a lot easier. The surface is rough where her name was ground away. I can see the shape of her letters interspersed between mine. It&apos;s been sanded enough that I&apos;m sure she&apos;s not the first: it&apos;s evident that the names of cadets were stacked and scratched nearly halfway through the metal shaft &mdash; at least twenty of them &mdash; and I doubt all those tenants left to move into a permanent home.</p><p>&emsp;The brief pang of fear surprises me, nearly overriding my hunger.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A shame she was drafted,&quot; Derry says, but his face lightens. &quot;But you seem lovely, too. Keep us entertained with stories of your little . . . quests, and we&apos;ll share a little,&quot; he insists.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I can do that,&quot; I manage: tempted, but too timid to ask how many faces they&apos;ve seen before.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s your name, dear?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya.

I rush through the front door with the delicious bread dissolving between my teeth, and as I turn to set the lock, I catch the sight of a familiar face. </p><p>&emsp;Bertram struggles to bend down and tie his boot. I&apos;m not the only one that&apos;s not used to the armor.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s like the old village all over again,&quot; I shout.</p><p>&emsp;It startles him. He mulls over a response as I approach, struggling harder to tie a simple knot. &quot;Less fire, though. I hope it stays that way.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Speaking of disasters,&quot; I say, &quot;I don&apos;t mind watching you struggle for a while, but are you going to let me help you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Bertram blushes, then nods.

What&apos;s gonna change their mind on Monday, bro? My work never runs drug tests,&quot; he says. Gunfire cracks over the TV, flashing the empty walls with pops of color.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No shit, Miguel. Their corporate structure banks on baked box-boys like you. The ones that forget they&apos;re lifting crates and stocking shelves and selling printers for eight hours a day.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s manager Miguel now &mdash; I order the little guys to do it. I&apos;m a number-puncher like you now,&quot; He brags. &quot;Oh. But except I&apos;m actually good enough to get promoted.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The words hit at the same time as a round-ending enemy airstrike. The bombs collapse my soldier to the dirt as the word DEFEAT brandishes across the screens, reassuring us that &quot;we&apos;ll get them next time.&quot; But his quips hurt no more than the vibrations in the controller.</p><p>&emsp; Miguel cracks another lukewarm beer, kicking the box of the remaining 27 over to me. I put down my custom controller.</p><p>&emsp; &quot;I get bringing over a six-pack of some IPA, maybe a 12-pack of Coors or something, but thirty?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He manages a straight face as his brown eyes pierce mine, wiping the suds from his scruffy lip rug. &quot;You know, Jesus was wrong when he said &apos;man can&apos;t live on bread alone.&apos; He didn&apos;t know you could drink it yet.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Is that right?&quot; I laugh.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;ve been rolling around the back of my car for a couple weeks after going to Katy&apos;s house. You know, high school Katy?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No?&quot;</p><p>&emsp; &quot;The pregnancy scare one, with the nice&mdash;.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, no &mdash; I remember,&quot; I say. Her face flashes in my mind from our junior prom group. Miguel took her while I took Kei.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I took her friend home and stole the thirty-rack since no one touched it. Those guys are all fuckin&apos; hipsters, man, so far up their ass about IPA&apos;s and stuff, they won&apos;t drink just to get drunk anymore.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Coming from the guy who doesn&apos;t smoke just to get high,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Passionate stoners are worse than drinkers. You couldn&apos;t be any more uninteresting when you&apos;re talking about &apos;Sour Dee&apos; or whatever,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Fuck off.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He burps. I crack another warm one, and when the timer on the pre-game lobby counts to zero, I lift my controller again. But he hits me with something that isn&apos;t just a snide comeback.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do you miss high school?&quot; He asks.</p><p>&emsp;It takes me a moment to think. I haven&apos;t really considered it, though I&apos;ve noticed myself staying away from those places we hung out between classes and after school. Those places have some gravity I&apos;m afraid will get me sucked into that past, when I&apos;ve worked so hard to put those good times behind me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I dunno. It&apos;s like a friend you haven&apos;t seen in a while. Nice to visit every once in a while and relish in the past. But it&apos;s best for both of us if we move on, you know?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;He drops the controller into his lap. My thumbs dig into the sticks when I climb a ladder for a sniper nest, only to get blasted off by a camper.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You trying to say something?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, dude,&quot; I start. &quot;I&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You can use that losing take on Kei or Kylie all you want, but on your friend?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, of course not! No, man. You&apos;re my best friend. You-&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m messing with you, fucker,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;He laughs, swigging the rest of his beer between deaths.</p><p>&emsp;He says, &quot;I do. I mean, a part of me does. I hated high school until the end of junior year when our group really started to hang out. It&apos;s like, I never felt like I was a part of something until then. And . . . I don&apos;t know if I really felt it since.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I wonder what the others are up to,&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Kayla&apos;s having her second kid already. Another girl, I think. Her and Johnny Boy are still together.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I was surprised. Getting married half a year after high school? I didn&apos;t think they&apos;d make it this far.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You never went to their wedding, though.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I was in college halfway across the country, bud,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about Kei?&quot; He asks. &quot;You were trying to get with her for a while, but you never had the cajones to do it before she graduated after our junior year.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve told you before,&quot; I say. &quot;She&apos;s at my work.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No shit!&quot; He laughs. &quot;Puta madre, the yellow thirst was real for you, man.&quot; He cracks another can after getting mowed down by an LMG. &quot;Are you gonna shoot your shot? You told me you got some experience in college, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. But I don&apos;t know...&quot; none of those nights in college really fulfilled me. I was always missing something. &quot;I&apos;m not into the clubbing scene like you are.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;All you have to do is ask! It&apos;s not like high school. Alcohol changes things. The fellas I met in college showed me all around the city. I know that shit like the front of my hand!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Back. The back of your hand,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Whatever. But we need to get you laid, now that you got this fine house. Shit, man, I wish I could afford something like this. People our age probably never will.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you still live here in Hearthland Ridge,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Paying for a studio! Like living in a fuckin&apos; box for seventeen hundred a month,&quot; he says. &quot;Walls so paper-thin I can hear everything. I&apos;d rather go out and get some pussy than cuck myself to the soundtrack of someone else getting it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh, sure,&quot; I say &mdash; sometimes I wonder if he tries to fit as many of those words as he can into a sentence. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;But really. I&apos;m proud of you, man,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Really. You&apos;ve worked hard and you&apos;ve made it. When I was trying to work my way through our senior class, you were grinding at math and shit. You have an actual chance to get wifed up. It&apos;s not in my blood.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, I don&apos;t want to. I like the chase better,  you know. Settling down? That&apos;s like giving up. What do you do, then? With that feeling, you know, when you have a couple rats with some chick and you know you&apos;re locked in for the next forever?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The feeling&apos;s all I&apos;ve been able to think about since I got back here. No more regimentation. No convenient road map of class to class to graduation: now it&apos;s all just open-ended.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But, like, nothing against you if you&apos;re into that. Having rats can be dope. They mow your lawn and shit.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Someday. Maybe. I&apos;m just too boring, I think,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Boring? You were the heart of our group back then, dude. You brought us together. You&apos;re good at that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But nothing&apos;s forcing any of us to be together anymore,&quot; I say. &quot;Look at how many have moved away from here. It&apos;s just you and me now, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Kayla and John are in California. Michael went to Kansas. He likes flat woman, so I guess he wants a state that can get him off just by driving on the roads.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The beer comes up my nose. I drop the controller and the batteries pop out. &quot;Ugh. Fuck, man,&quot; I say, balancing the pain of carbonation in my nose with the urge to laugh, imagining Mike trying to stick his wiener in a Kansas anthill.</p><p>&emsp;Miguel says, &quot;Maybe we&apos;ll be stuck here forever. But hey, as long as we&apos;re both here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just wish . . .&quot; I start to say, but instead, I reach down and pop the batteries back in the controller.</p><p>&emsp;He slicks his hair back again, finishing another one. &quot;Is it cool if I crash here? I mean, I can drive high, but not drunk.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure, man. But I don&apos;t have a cot or a sleeping bag or anything.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please. I&apos;ve slept on floors my whole adult life!&quot; He gestures to the box with 23 stones left. &quot;Now are you gonna help me finish all of them?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;All of them?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;All of them,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s Friday. I know we&apos;re old and shit now, but stay awake a little longer, like we&apos;re twelve and it&apos;s a sleepover in your parents&apos; basement, and I&apos;ll tell you a bedtime story.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, great. About what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;One time I was playing on your Xbox when you were out of town. When you had me pet-sitting, and...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll pass.

The overturned boxes are makeshift tables that keep the cans off the floor, since we&apos;re feeling too lazy to dig for a trash bag.</p><p>&emsp;I lift the can to my lips, but I don&apos;t let the poison pass the threshold. Past experience tells me that I&apos;m toeing my limit: lost enough to let my stupid emotions leak on my face, to conjure words to try to push them down, but not enough to kneel at the porcelain throne. I know the feeling is real because the wetness on my face gives it credence, and I often think he&apos;s the only friend I&apos;ve got left to listen.</p><p>&emsp;If only I could get him to.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How can you get it if you don&apos;t know what I mean?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I get it, bro, just not what you mean.&quot; Miguel lifts the cracked smartphone above his face as he lays on the futon, thumb-scrolling through an endless barrage of ads and entertainment. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What I mean is that I don&apos;t feel it anymore. My life is just work, then sleep, then work, then go to sleep, but it&apos;s nothing more than that. I don&apos;t have it like you do. You always have the energy, but I don&apos;t know how you find it.&quot; The tears leak further: I can&apos;t remember the last time I was drunk enough to let them out. &quot;But I know the time is in between there somewhere, I mean, I&apos;m certain I could fit in anything if I tried. But I&apos;m always just so damn tired.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He swipes right a couple times in a dating app, still refusing to look up. &quot;Time isn&apos;t the only thing that&apos;s too small of yours to fit.&quot; He laughs. Then the vibration from a match startles him. </p><p>&emsp;Miguel&apos;s thumb slips and he flings his phone in the air, letting out a grunt when it crashes into his nose.He jolts upright to rub the pain out, looking at me for the first time in an hour.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, shit. You&apos;re serious.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, you think this is just a bit?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, of course not.&quot; He sets his phone on a cardboard box and thinks for a moment. &quot;Why I &apos;feel it.&apos; I don&apos;t know . . . I guess I just got a big family that always keeps me busy. My cousins are young, and my siblings are still in college, so I end up going to their parties and stuff.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So it&apos;s like college never ended for you. Never realized I&apos;d miss it so much . . . my roommates made the damn experience,&quot; I say. It didn&apos;t matter if we were in the dorms or slumming it in an expensive renter-fixer-upper west of campus: those fuckers forced me to get out. &quot;Most nights, when I was studying in my bedroom, nose stuck in a textbook, they&apos;d pick the lock and barge in &mdash; shooting me with flaming Nerf darts, assaulting me with a pizza cutter, or dragging me to one of their parties.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He takes the last swig of his seventh can. &quot;Just like my older cousins. They show up to my house to drag me clubbing, even if I pulled a &apos;tenner&apos; at work.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Man. If my brother was still around, I&apos;m sure he&apos;d be over here all the time,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course. Our families had a lot of fun together: barbeques, parties at the park...&quot; The list trails off when he crunches the can in his hands.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You remember those weekends in middle school when we tried to beat the Halo campaign in a single night?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. And your brother would buy all those energy drinks, sneaking them downstairs for us,&quot; he says. &quot;Oh, and the summer tent sleepovers, remember that one night you were so scared of the lightning you couldn&apos;t move, and my dad had to carry you back inside?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I was stuck in the sleeping bag, so soaking wet from the rain I almost slid out of his arms,&quot; I say. We share a laugh. &quot;Or the RV trip we took for the out-of-state Lacrosse game&mdash;when we got stuck on the side of the road. We used up all the power playing GameCube and my dad was furious!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He laughs. &quot;Yeah. And we had to ask one of the families running behind to pick us up. The whole time we waited there, your dad was screaming at Triple-A, and your mom was trying to cook, but the RV tipped so far to the side that she couldn&apos;t set anything on the counter...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;...And all we could do was just pass the ball on the side of the road, wondering whether or not we were gonna make the game.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But we won that one, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah &mdash; I ripped the game-winning corner pocket.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh yeah. Their team was trash. The goalie scored on himself.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The nostalgia can only abate the emptiness for so long. I take another swig, feeling the body high mix with the dizziness from the flat beer. Without them, the next words might not have left me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But now it&apos;s just like . . . I dunno. I only know that it sucks, you know?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like, I&apos;m trying to care, but I don&apos;t. My mind doesn&apos;t want me to be happy.&quot; I nearly fall out of the folding chair when I&apos;m talking with my arms. &quot;We&apos;re not forced to get out there anymore. To meet new people, to keep friendships alive. All our friends are getting married or serious while we&apos;re just left behind. My parents nag me about it all the time: getting impatient since I&apos;m the only one left that&apos;ll keep the family name going. And&mdash;&quot;&quot;That shit doesn&apos;t matter. That&apos;s not what it&apos;s about,&quot; Miguel says. &quot;You just gotta do, man. You gotta do things just to do them.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I furrow my brows. &quot;To do what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He wets his lips on a last sip before he tries at something profound.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The doing is what makes happiness come, when even . . . even when you&apos;re, like, not happy, and shit, you force yourself to do things, so happy shit can happen more often and shit, so you can have the chance to enjoy it,&quot; he insists. </p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m lost without words, so he decides to muddy the waters even further.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You get the gist of what I&apos;m saying? Like, you have to decide to do no matter what. Like even when you don&apos;t feel like it, you know, you do. The doing, I mean, is something you choose which gives a chance of something good. Or something, at least. You know?&quot;I feel like I just had a seizure. &quot;What the fuck does that even mean?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know, man. Maybe I&apos;m bad at . . . no, maybe you suck at listening,&quot; he says. &quot;I said that shit perfectly.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I mutter to myself, trying to piece together what he said. It takes me a couple seconds. &quot;Force yourself to engage with the world. Give happiness its best chance to come out, because it&apos;s all you can do.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s exactly what I said!&quot; He snatches another can, using the light of the TV to inspect all the dents from rolling around in his Corolla.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like hell you did!&quot; I roll my eyes.</p><p>&emsp;His verbal seizure must have made him tired. He puts the can down instead of cracking another one, and after a long yawn, he pulls the unzipped sleeping bag off the floor and wraps it around himself on the futon.&quot;That thing goes down flat, you know,&quot; I offer. &quot;It doesn&apos;t have to be a couch.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Too much effort. I&apos;ve slept on worse,&quot; he says. &quot;I gotta get to sleep so I can make it to church tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And show up hungover? I doubt you&apos;ll make it through the service,&quot; I say. &quot;But, hey, if you stay a while after, I&apos;m sure you could catch the double-A meeting.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He&apos;s too tired for a clap-back. He&apos;s not even scrolling his phone anymore: just sprawled there with his feet dangling over the wobbly armrest, arms tucked beneath him, his face buried into a folded towel.</p><p>&emsp;I glance at the stove. &quot;It&apos;s only like 12:30.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Long day . . . leading idiots . . . feels so late,&quot; he says, turning to bury his face in the leather crevice of the couch.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So much for an all-nighter, huh?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nnnn,&quot; he mumbles into the towel. &quot;Guessn&apos;t.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess we&apos;re not young anymore,&quot; I say. &quot;We didn&apos;t even make it through half the rack.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nn.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So are we gonna finish these?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;No answer.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I said...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;But then I give up.</p>"},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"90","GivenName":"A Future Foretold","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Six","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Seven","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":6,"ChapterFull":7,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":26,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"Final Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"24","Synopsis":"Katiya tries not to panic at what feels inevitable.","Summary":"> A slow first day ends in panic.> They respond to the events of Firebrand.> Katiya&apos;s anxiety cracks her tough facade.","VerboseID":"2.7","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"04/25/26","FantasyTime":"2A-128, 54th of Verdantide","StoryDay":"Saturday","Setting":"Southern Fields"},"DocName":"06 // &quot;A Future Foretold&quot;","Body":""},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":1,"AutoNameFull":18,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":6,"ChapterFull":7,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":1,"SceneFull":18,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":27,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"Revised Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"25","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.7.18","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-17","Body":"<p>&emsp;&quot;Is that as bad as it gets?

Despite the half-baked ramblings that often get him in trouble, Pax is right this time. There wasn&apos;t a single scouting mission on the board beyond patrolling the town.</p><p>&emsp;Does it really get this easy?</p><p>&emsp;I wait until the switchback slithers east and the trail straightens, catching the fading light on my first quest form. It&apos;s stamped and scribbled with an illiterate farmer&apos;s signature, dirtied from folding by my soil-soaked fingers. Something catches my eye before we turn another corner: a small statement that the guildscribes helped the farmer write, the only part of the form scrawled in coherent letters.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hah, did you see this section?&quot; I ask Bertram. Pax and Ryder look over our heads without bending. &quot;List the concern and how it demands the strength of the Royal Guard&apos;s Knights.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Bertram squints, reading the two words before a laugh seizes his throat. </p><p>&emsp;Ryder reads it instead.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Defending vegetables.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;From what?&quot; Pax asks. &quot;Hungry bellies?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We share a laugh.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;If this is as hard as it gets, then this is a vacation,&quot; Pax says, showing us his large, calloused hands. &quot;I grew up on the outer farmlands of the Capital, working fields from dawn to dusk. Every day I was strapped for time. But this was nothing.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Bertram agrees. &quot;Farming up here is practically a hobby with how that town in the North supplies us. Blackwater, I think? They supply the whole damn capital, but shouldn&apos;t they be covered in frost?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I agree. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Most maps don&apos;t even chart the land north of the Purgatory Mountains,&quot; I say. &quot;It should be a frozen wasteland.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It sure is. I used to live there, up in Blackwater,&quot; Ryder says. It&apos;s probably the first fact he&apos;s volunteered since I met him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No way. I&apos;ve never met someone from up there,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Me neither,&quot; Pax says. &quot;I guess there&apos;s no reason to leave when there&apos;s no chance to starve, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s no reason to leave because you can&apos;t. Not unless you spend your whole life plotting an escape.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The words are enough to halt us.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;An escape?&quot; Bertram asks. &quot;Why would you have to escape? I thought they were part of the empire. Some kind of commune of field-hands and farmers, with enough Essence to keep the climate year-round.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s not enough Essence in all of Fosroth to allow that,&quot; Pax adds. &quot;Trust me. The Capital lands are unworkable in the winter. I couldn&apos;t even use a spade on them before I left. So I can&apos;t even imagine working the lands up there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s because the lands are&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;His words cut off when a crimson glow saturates the northern hills. We&apos;re too slow to shield our eyes when a blinding light flashes from beyond the Purgatory Mountains, as if brought by Ryder&apos;s invocation.</p><p>&emsp;It barely catches our eyes as we descend the southern foothills. Any one of us could have missed it if we blinked at the wrong time. But before we can second-guess this shared experience &mdash; held as a glow in our retinas when we close our eyes &mdash; we find the faintest column of crimson light stretching skyward, like a glowing thread tethering our world of Fosroth to the stars.</p><p>&emsp;It fades like lightning before we have the time to speak its presence. An eerie silence overshadows the town. The wind withdraws with bated breath. The crickets refuse to rub their wings. But to us &mdash; a naive band of knights that only know battle through secondhand stories &mdash; it&apos;s the truest evidence of a war we&apos;ve gotten yet, and it runs my skin with gooseflesh.</p><p>&emsp;Our pace hastens down the treacherous trail. The trembling words fill every inch of impedance that keeps us from an outright sprint.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I thought the war was contained to the east, not the north! How would they even get around that far?&quot; Paxton huffs.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;d be almost impossible for the enemy to take Blackwater,&quot; Ryder says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But the column was red!&quot; Bertram says. &quot;There&apos;s surely a Mask up there that just did something. It might have even been their Divine Wish...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You mean they just jettisoned all their Essence?&quot; I ask. Essence on the order of the Gods breaks the very laws of this world. Only a select few carry the blessing in their blood. But using it all at once comes at the cost of life.</p><p>&emsp;We tap our circuits for Essence, for the strength in our legs to descend faster and faster, predicating the call to Gaffesend Base. The trail ends on the side of the long, wrapping road we tried to cut, and then it&apos;s a dead sprint. </p><p>&emsp;I refuse to be late on the first day. My sickening fear and small size propel me far ahead of the others, drawing on more anxiety than Essence as I tear past the landmarks of our small town. The trail transitions from matted dirt to concrete, to cobblestone, then back to concrete, until I&apos;m rushing along the west edge of the lake in the military district: dragged forward by the weight of the thin breastplate; begged by my burning lungs to stop or else I might collapse into the water.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":19,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":6,"ChapterFull":7,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":19,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":28,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"Revised Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"26","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.7.19","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-18","Body":"<p>&emsp;I pass the threshold of the gate, gasping for breaths as my last sprint dissolves into a jog. It becomes immediately obvious that weren&apos;t the only ones to notice: most of the recruits gather outside the guard post, swarming around the re-purposed adventurers&apos; guild like flies to excrement. </p><p>&emsp;I spot my brother Erik leaning against the doorframe.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s happening?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Some major Essence event.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, we saw it. We were on the southern hills.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I gasp for breath. He hands me his canteen. One long drink later, I find my mouth wet enough to continue.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Should we be afraid?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Afraid? Guards aren&apos;t supposed to be afraid,&quot; he says, staring down at me with our father&apos;s amber eyes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not afraid . . . I meant concerned,&quot; I say. My mind&apos;s too busy redirecting resources to my starving muscles, and I can feel it in the heat of my flushed face.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t think so.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I try to slide past him to get in, but he traps me with his brazen arms. &quot;Relax,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;re going to be fine. You know I wouldn&apos;t let anything happen to you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know that,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You always get so damn worked up. Just breathe,&quot; he demands. &quot;We&apos;re safe here in the city.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I draw several long breaths in my nose and out my mouth before he releases me, just as Bertram, Pax, and Ryder finally catch up.  We enter the main room of the command post, packed to the walls with knights and soldiers. In the corner, the Line Type machines send a one-way barrage of signals across wires. There are three of them: one for the war front, one for the capital, and one that&apos;s used for up north, rarely getting an answer to anything.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Status of Blackwater?&quot; Aldrin orders.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Clearing the line right now to get their response,&quot; a guard says.</p><p>&emsp;Loud chirps on the line screech with the strain of such distance. The vibrations resonate different-shaped keys that dance in their fixtures, stamping against a swiftly scrolling sheet of paper. A long half-minute passes, and the guard impatiently waits until there&apos;s enough information to report on.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Blackwater is safe,&quot; the guard says first. &quot;A civilian event in the north district. General Ullrich sending Royal Guard to investigate, not a Mask event, full stop,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;The room breathes a collective sigh of relief.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Was it perpetrated by Chymaeran meddling?&quot; Aldrin asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t think so,&quot; he says. &quot;I&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We don&apos;t &apos;think&apos; here! We speak when we know, and we know when we do,&quot; he barks. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh-Understood, sir.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Relay to the Valensends in the Capital. And send it to the boys at the front, so they don&apos;t have something extra to stress over tonight,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Prompting the line,&quot; the others say, setting the mechanical keys in position.</p><p>&emsp;Aldrin turns from the command zone to address the mix of soldiers and guards. &quot;Looks like an oddity: maybe Essence stores ignited. If it was a Divine Wish, we would know it &mdash; it surely would have done a lot more damage. I&apos;ve heard some group up there called the &apos;Carmine&apos; hoards dead Essence, so maybe it was them,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;He turns to the guildscribes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll run a couple scouting parties, just in case. Write up some quest forms for the new knights: this is a good excuse to get some experience and some exercise.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The guildscribes nod before he turns to us again, waiting until all the novice knights file in through the double doors.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Things should die down in a week, but we&apos;re going to keep the city on alert. We want to be sure that the Chymaera aren&apos;t using this as an opportunity to strike.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I know what he&apos;s going to ask for next when his eyes dart between the new recruits. I try to dissolve into the crowd, hoping the discomfort in my chest is just exhaustion from running across the town.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I need volunteers for night watch, to head north and see what&apos;s going on,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s worth a quest. Extra work means an extra day off.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I falter when I&apos;m shoulder-to-shoulder with my colleagues. Guilt and shame tug me forward, but that same crushing feeling I found in the cabin is so much stronger.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is easy. No more than several hours,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;You&apos;re all going to do this, is what I hear.</p><p>&emsp;I can only watch as my colleagues step forward, arranging themselves in groups, but I taste the smoke. I&apos;m snared in the past. I can see the Chymaerans and their glowing, amethyst eyes as they penetrate the shattered glass windows, stretching with their sharp obsidian limbs to finish what the fire began.</p><p>&emsp;This self-immolating spite can only swell when the lust for flight outpaces fight. My hands run cold as if the Chymaeran Curse were churning in my circuits, chilling my veins, and I have to lean against the wall to catch a breath.</p><p>&emsp;Bertram follows me outside. I&apos;m fortunate that the others are too distracted to witness this moment of utter weakness.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s going on, Kat?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I feel sick,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Right now? All of a sudden?&quot; He asks.</p><p>&emsp;I feel like I&apos;m going to lose my breakfast and lunch. It&apos;s only then that he realizes he&apos;s drawing attention.</p><p>&emsp;I feel a shock pulse my body when the worst comes to pass, unable to speak or explain when Aldrin steps outside.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s going on here?&quot; Aldrin asks.</p><p>&emsp;I don&apos;t want to look weak, but maybe I should just tell him. There&apos;s no way out of this. After I think I have a grasp on my nausea, I open my mouth to speak.</p><p>&emsp;But Bertram beats me to it.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s been feeling sick since the farm,&quot; he says. &quot;They were trying to be nice with the samples and the free meal, and we were trying to be respectful: first day, you know. But after all the running...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;She seemed fine minutes ago,&quot; Aldrin says.</p><p>&emsp;I doubt this farce will work. I say, &quot;No, I&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because she didn&apos;t want to look weak on the first day,&quot; Bertram says. &quot;Don&apos;t you know how hard it is for her? She talked to me the whole way back about it, being a female guard and all, trying not to prove the stereotype.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh,&quot; Aldrin says. He approaches, placing his glove on my shoulder. &quot;I respect that. We refuse to have that kind of backwards thinking in our ranks. We&apos;re trying to get rid of it. But you&apos;re not of use to me if you&apos;re not at your best,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;I can feel the cold night air again. I manage to stand upright without the wall.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;T-thank you,&quot; I say, wiping my mouth, although my stomach and its contents are still there.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Go home and get some rest: this is hardly a task, I just wanted an excuse to give you junior guards some exercise,&quot; he tells me. &quot;And Berry&mdash;would you mind walking her home?&quot; He hands two quest forms to him. &quot;Bring these back to me tomorrow. I&apos;ll give you credit.&quot; And then he whispers: &quot;Just don&apos;t tell anyone else.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, sir. Thank you, sir,&quot; Bertram says, taking my arm before he escorts me towards the complex. We make sure to pass the gates before we drop the act.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":3,"AutoNameFull":20,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":6,"ChapterFull":7,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":20,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":29,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"Revised Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"27","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.7.20","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-19","Body":"<p>&emsp;&quot;What was that about?&quot; Bertram asks.

I thought I wasn&apos;t so damn weak and pathetic...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re not pathetic! You earned your presence here,&quot; he assures me. &quot;You had a bad day, is all.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But how can I last when it&apos;s really down to the wire, when it&apos;s real, if my mind fights me at something so simple, so stupid and pathetic and weak, like this?&quot; I let out an exasperated groan. If he wasn&apos;t holding me, I might bash myself in the face with my gauntlets.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;ll take it step-by-step. You have time. Space in some scouting missions between the banal tasks,&quot; he insists.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But that was the first step. It was a step down. It was so low that it couldn&apos;t have even been called a step, and I tripped,&quot; I tell him, feeling the tears well up in my eyes. &quot;We went through the same thing that day, how does it not come back to haunt you? Why don&apos;t you run? Why are you so still?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he tells me, still holding me upright when all I want to do is crumble. &quot;I just live in the absolute present. I just find that I&apos;m less attached to it all: maybe I just don&apos;t care what happens.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What does that even mean?&quot; I ask, wiping my eyes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know. Maybe I&apos;m just bad at describing it,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I can feel him quickly release his hands when he realizes he&apos;s holding me up by the contours of my breastplate.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sorry.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The suddenness gets me to crack a smile. It escalates further. Pretty soon we&apos;re both laughing, and I wipe the tears from my eyes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But really, though. I promise that I&apos;ll always have your back. I won&apos;t go off and die on you,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You better not,&quot; I tell him, still letting off a couple chuckles before my lungs settle. &quot;We&apos;ll defend some more vegetables tomorrow. Maybe even something more dangerous.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Really sharp carrots?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll look forward to it,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;There&apos;s a certain hesitation in him when he stands close, as if there&apos;s something more he wants to say. But the moment passes. Instead, he hands me my copy of the quest sheet.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well,&quot; he says. &quot;I guess I&apos;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Until tomorrow,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;I wave to him as I fumble for the key in my pocket; feeling for the name etched into the iron; making sure it&apos;s still there; praying to the Gods that it won&apos;t be ground any further. There&apos;s a sweet smell of grilled meat that makes me hungry: someone cooks a pig on a spit across the way. </p><p>&emsp;Longing for rations after a long day, I turn my head to the entry window, trying to decide what I&apos;ll make. But instead, I find an odd, unflickering light illuminating the walls.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My body is out of adrenaline, so I&apos;m strangely calm. I approach the window instead of the door, trying to remember if I latched the back window after getting free breakfast from the merchants. I press my ear to the thin, wavy glass for an auditory cue: unable to see clearly through the drawn curtains, holding my breath until I hear the words of a foreign tongue. The words lack the harshness of Chymaeran dialect. Maybe it&apos;s Ahkvasan? Auvryan or Verdalan? One of the old dialects?</p><p>&emsp;I can only make out the silhouette of a stumbling man, holding something thicker than a rapier but thinner than a sword. He doesn&apos;t seem to be taking anything. Maybe this is a test &mdash; maybe Aldrin didn&apos;t mean it and wants to see if my actions can match my claims to courage.</p><p>&emsp;I approach the front door, allowing the burgeoning anger of my incompetence to consume me, leaving no space for fear. My hand is steady, unsheathing the dagger as I gingerly turn the key in the lock until it clicks. There&apos;s no room for explanation that this isn&apos;t a test or a burglar, so I let the Essence saturate my circuits.</p><p>&emsp;I turn the handle and rush the intruder. I spring forward with such force that the floorboards nearly snap when they give. My circuits run hot with Essence. My hands glow orange with heat, ready to burn their flesh until they beg to be sent to the Reservoir of Souls. </p><p>&emsp;I cross the entire span of the bottom floor.</p><p>&emsp;But just before I&apos;m ready to deal his death, he turns to face me, and I&apos;m unable to reconcile the oddness of his appearance.</p><p>&emsp;The man looks no older than I am, somewhere halfway mixed between a Royal and a vagrant. The fineness of his silken shirt is accented with a checkered pattern of light blue boxes. The fabric is whiter than snow. His stubble is unkempt and shaggy though his light brown hair is clipped finer than all the royals I&apos;ve ever seen. His brown eyes widen with panic as I intercept him, casting him over the kitchen table, and against the back wall, searing the fabric of his fine shirt with fire before I can withdraw the heat from my hands.</p><p>&emsp;He drops the strange sword against the ground, and it looks like a metal training stick that ends with a basket, not even a blade. </p><p>&emsp;Is it a broom? Is he some kind of housekeeper hired by the Royal Guard, another service like the knocker?</p><p>&emsp;He&apos;s far too weak to put up a fight when I straddle him against the floor, his face smudged in the puddle of porridge I left when I was rushing out the door. He&apos;s so weak that I have to lighten my grasp or else I might break his bones.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s then that he spills his first string of words to me.

I fight the spinning world, stumbling towards the kitchen counter to grab the remote. Freaky Friday autoplays on some free streaming service, since I was too lazy to enter the family account. I reach to turn off the floor-bound wall TV, but I hesitate &mdash; finding that I enjoy the faint sound of it over the silence.</p><p>&emsp;It feels nice to have my friend here, I think.</p><p>&emsp;The tears still wet my face, more from the laughter of digging up past memories than the emptiness. I find myself disoriented when I try to walk, so I lift my old lacrosse stick from the ground to use it as a cane, digging my fingers into the mesh of the basket. I realize there must be an open window when a chill convects the wetness of my skin.</p><p>&emsp;I hobble towards the wall, nearly in-step with Miguel&apos;s snore, trying to dodge the crumpled cans. The window is open, but the breeze funnels out instead of in. </p><p>&emsp;I remember my first Thermo class. Isn&apos;t hot supposed to run to cold?</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m not in a headspace where I can read the clues. My stomach pangs when the sweet aroma of fresh meat fills the vacant home. I look out the open window, as if any one of my older neighbors would be grilling burgers at one o&apos;clock in the morning. But I know the college years of that are long behind me.</p><p>&emsp;My ears pop when I drag the window closed along its tracks. The air is dry, and when I stumble towards the source of the gusting winds &mdash; the small closet beneath the stairs &mdash;a faint, flickering light glows in the space beneath the door.</p><p>&emsp;An empty can crunches when I step on it, and I realize I&apos;m still wearing my steel-toed shoes, along with the rest of my casual work clothes. The lacrosse stick braces me as I stumble forwards&mdash;feeling like my uncle does on Ambien when he doesn&apos;t fall asleep in time&mdash;until my hand touches the freezing handle.</p><p>&emsp;Tumultuous winds scream beneath the door and through the cracks, bashing the fitting against the lock. My mind doesn&apos;t work well when it&apos;s crossed, but I find myself fixated on how strange the closet door looks. I never noticed the handle, etched with an intricacy so far outside the palate of the builders&apos; package. Surely Mom or Dad would have noticed it on any one of the tours, right?</p><p>&emsp;I turn the knob far enough that the bolt no longer withholds the gale. The wooden door buffets me in the face. Stars flash in my vision, and if it weren&apos;t for the lacrosse stick, I would have slammed my head on the granite counter. Instead, I find myself slumped beneath the bartop, barricaded by two metal stools.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m speechless until the rooms equalize in pressure, rubbing out the ache in my forehead. I lift my eyes. No longer does the closet greet me, but the light of a whole other townhouse on the opposing side.</p><p>&emsp;Unable to fathom whether this dream is just the imaginings of an inebriated mind, I lift myself from the floor and stumble through the threshold of the archway. The contours of the floor change from that of smooth, buffered wood to sanded planks and stone. On the other side is another thick wooden door with the same handle, thrown all the way open. I wonder if my neighbors are so old that they insist on the technology of the last century. Who would spend the money to furnish their townhome this way, with walls and decor so aged my great-grandmother would feel at home?</p><p>&emsp;It feels so wrong to be here, but I&apos;m a social drunk, and this is a chance to make friends.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hello? You forgot to lock your door. Sorry to intrude &mdash; I&apos;m the neighbor from the unit on the other side. My name is Cody, Cody Dunsmore,&quot; I say, and so I continue, stammering my words to ensure my presence isn&apos;t a surprise, though with cast iron kettles and candles, I doubt these fogies would be agile enough to swing anything at their friendly intruder.</p><p>&emsp;I find a knight&apos;s uniform on the table, tailored to a woman&apos;s measurements, along with realistic metal boots.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The old bat must be into costume play. Whatever gets you off,&quot; I mutter, but then I see the biggest surprise leaning against the wall. I try to take it in my hands, but it&apos;s so damn heavy: nothing like the weapons those mall ninjas buy at conventions.</p><p>&emsp;I drop the lacrosse stick to try to lift it. Surely it&apos;s one of those real-looking swords the neckbeards buy, right?</p><p>&emsp;Nope.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Christ almighty!&quot; I exclaim.</p><p>&emsp;I try to steady it the same way I saw in the movies, but it kills my wrists. I wonder how many exercises these geriatric fantasy fetishists have to do to hold a sword like this, like holding a barbell by its end.</p><p>&emsp;I put it back against the wall, and I decide to try speaking again. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hello? You left your door open.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;The house smells too musty to be a new build, like it&apos;s seen generations of families through its halls. Spiderwebs collect in the corners of the cabinets. The crimson curtains are bleached from decades of continuous sunlight. And when I fumble for a light switch on the walls, I find nothing: nor a single cord in this simple home snaked across the surface.</p><p>&emsp;The space is dead silent in the absence of appliances: so silent that I can hear the heartbeat in my ears. Maybe I should return home to try again tomorrow. </p><p>&emsp;But my plan is cut short when a shadow slides behind the marbled glass.</p><p>&emsp;I haven&apos;t the time to react when the door blasts open, screeching on rusted hinges. The intruder closes the distance before I even have a chance to react, blasting their glowing palm against my shoulder, casting me over their dining table with a whole handprint burned into my beer-stained work shirt.</p><p>&emsp;The female knight is quick to pin me against the floor, straddling me with her bare thighs. My mind races to explain. I can only consider she&apos;s an influencer, or one of those intensely dedicated cosplayers I found LARPing on campus. Her speech is incoherent, but the longer she berates me in her mother language, drawing the prop knife against my neck as I struggle under her inhuman strength, a strange comprehension of her words slowly overtakes me.</p><p>&emsp;I feel the sentiment behind her panic. I thought she was just speaking in tongues, but I can feel my mind strain as it arranges itself to piece together the meaning of the words. And when the headache passes, I realize that I can understand her fully.</p><p>&emsp;Her voice is beautiful.</p><p>&emsp;Her eyes are a golden hazel from colored contacts, and she&apos;s dressed like one of those hobbyists at the Shaleborough Renaissance Faire. Her blond, silken braid hangs from her head as she leans over me, making her look more like an angry princess than a defensive knight.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please, please,&quot; I beg. </p><p>&emsp;But I find the panic in her face to be even greater than mine. She breathes heavily with trembling hands, rocking on my torso with every shallow breath. It&apos;s the most excitement I&apos;ve felt in ages. The sudden rise in emotion ignites something I&apos;m even more afraid of, and I try to make it known to her. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I think you should get off me, I&mdash;I can&apos;t control it,&quot; I say, but she&apos;s clueless about what she does to me, straddling my waist with her strong, bare thighs.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asks.</p><p>&emsp;My arms are pinned beneath her legs. The pressure pounds in my skull. There&apos;s no chance to try the waistband trick, and there&apos;s only one place that all the blood can go.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re a fool to break into the military district.

My mind can&apos;t catch up fast enough for all the semantics, but I know exactly what he means.</p><p>&emsp;I can feel it.</p><p>&emsp;My face flushes. &quot;You degenerate! You lecherous, filthy animal, breaking into my house to . . . to&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I swear, I didn&apos;t break in here,&quot; he insists. His face is redder than mine. He covers his crotch with his hands, as if hiding the pitched tent can make me forget. &quot;The door was open. I just walked in.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The door was locked, you fool,&quot; I say, pointing to the narrowly-cracked entry door behind me, but he gestures with his head to the small closet. &quot;The closet? How would you break in through a damn closet? There&apos;s no windows in there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know, but please. I&apos;m as confused as you are,&quot; he says. &quot;Give me a chance to explain.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re excited, not confused!&quot; I point the dagger between his legs. &quot;You don&apos;t have the right to be confused right now. I&apos;m the one that&apos;s confused at how&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;Would you let me explain? Dear God!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s Gods, you heretic,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Respect other races. We&apos;re not the only one that shares Fosroth, and all our Gods have proven their presence.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;God, I said,&quot; he says. &quot;A real god, not the ones you cosplay freaks pretend to worship.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do you want to be executed for apostasy? Because I can do that for you, right now,&quot; I notice that his eyes keep falling on the closet. The closet, my bare legs, my breastplate, and then the closet. I circle between him and the door, leaving only the entrance as an escape: like coaxing a rat out of the house without having to kill it.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What I want is to go home,&quot; he says. &quot;Not to get stabbed by a letter opener. I&apos;m your neighbor, and the door between our units was open. I was simply trying to tell you,&quot; the liar insists. He heaves for a couple breaths. &quot;Did you really have to tackle me to get your point across?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You do not live here. This is the Military District. Besides &mdash; you&apos;ve proved that you are far too weak to live here,&quot; I say, approaching him with the dagger.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You bitch, I can bench a plate at least,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Putting plates on benches? What, are you a fat oaf that eats outside all day?&quot; but he looks reasonably fit beneath his ruined shirt. Defined shoulder muscles, trained without Essence . . . maybe he&apos;s a laboring refugee from the North?</p><p>&emsp;He raises his hands as he tries to stand up with only his legs, but he can&apos;t. &quot;I&apos;m sorry to intrude. Look. I know you might be into cosplay or whatever, but this is taking things way too far.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cosplay?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Costume play. At first I thought it was old people living here: the kettle, the candles . . . I mean, the whole damn house is set up like Skyrim.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Costume?</p><p>&emsp;A fucking costume?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is not a COSTUME!&quot;  </p><p>&emsp;He shrinks at the thunder in my voice. His singed nobleman&apos;s shirt hangs open as he edges towards the front door on his hands and knees, and I follow him step-for-step. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do you know how hard I worked for this?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah . . . lots of trips to the craft store,&quot; he adds.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How hard I worked to wear this proudly as a guardian?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Did you make it during the craft foam sale? I go there for the graphing pencils.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What the Res are you talking about?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Mechanical pencils,&quot; he rambles. &quot;Point-five is a toothpick, and point-nine is like a fucking crayon&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You dare to insult me like this? For what, because I&apos;m a female guard?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. Of course not, you&apos;re very convincing.&quot; His voice crackles on every other syllable, trying to inject some abject form of flattery. &quot;It&apos;s amazing. Prop knife? Form-fit foam from the craft store, spray-painted to look like metal armor? Even the stitching looks like an eighteenth-century corset. I can tell you&apos;ve put a lot of time into it. You&apos;re a lot like my older cousin, and I&apos;m sure you have loads of followers like she does. I know I&apos;d follow you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re too yellow to follow me anywhere,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;On-line, I mean,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;On what line?&quot; I ask. &quot;The front? You would never get close. They&apos;d keep you busy peeling potatoes with such soft hands.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Soft hands? Please. You&apos;re the job that banks on soft hands. While you&apos;re busy pleasuring perverts over your webcam, I work in an office. Designing the damn future. Because the rest of us have to work real jobs, not getting paid by thirsty horndogs that jerk off to Shakespeare.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The real work is defending the ungrateful, undeserving gentry like you. Why don&apos;t you crawl back to mummy and daddy dearest for another bump to your filthy allowance?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;That last line would provoke any true noble. I expect him to go cry fowl to his underpaid servants, to his nanny, or to his absentee parents, complaining all way up the chain to my captain. I sincerely hope he does, because Aldrin is backwater enough to hate anything that wears its wealth and wreaks of privilege.</p><p>&emsp;But hes&apos;s not that kind of upset. He doesn&apos;t seem offended in any way. This idiot still holds a sense of humor, as if he thinks it&apos;s all a ruse. The further the corners of his mouth crease on a laugh, the more it infuriates me, and as he stands, he opens his stupid mouth to cross the line.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Enough pretend. Your knife isn&apos;t even real.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Pray tell, does this feel real?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I take a slash at his arm, trying to carve him with something small and impermanent: small enough to disappear in a day, but enough to remember the lesson. But the fool flinches, blocking my dagger with his left hand. </p><p>&emsp;Idiot.</p><p>&emsp;The edge catches on his palm, drawing an instant, deep line of gushing blood. His expression changes in an instant, as if surprised that knives have an edge to them. Maybe I&apos;ll have to explain next that my Essenced fire actually burns, and water actually drowns.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You . . . you actually . . .&quot; he starts, his back pressed against the front door as he watches the blood trickle down his left wrist, absorbing in the tarnished fabric of his charred left sleeve. </p><p>&emsp;I flick the crimson from the dagger, flipping it around to imply the next strike will impale him. &quot;It&apos;s time for you to leave. It&apos;s getting late, and by the Gods, I&apos;d rather abstain from filing a casualty report tonight.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He fumbles for the door with his working hand, wrapping his left palm in more of the pristine, white fabric, struggling to grasp the handle when his eyes are on the weapon. &quot;Jesus Christ! Are you insane? Do you have no boundary with your stupid fantasy? Castle Law or not, I&apos;m calling the police.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Get out,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This was my favorite shirt!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I said, GET OUT!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;As soon as the door cracks enough to silhouette his body against the night, I lift my leg and boot him square in the chest, planting a muddy print on the last untarnished space in the fabric. He falls over the first set of steps and lands in the dirt, groaning as I slam the door shut. </p><p>&emsp;He&apos;ll live.</p><p>&emsp;I rush to the window, throwing the shades open just enough to peer into the darkness, drawn by my biting curiosity to see what unfolds.  What an idiot &mdash; now he&apos;s struggling to tear the sleeve off his bloodstained shirt, ripping at the fabric where my Essenced plume singed it black.</p><p>&emsp;But it still bothers me. Why was he so drawn to the shallow closet? Even under duress, I don&apos;t know how he could be stupid enough to insist he entered through a door. There&apos;s surely nothing in this column of a cottage worth breaking into &mdash; especially into the home of a Royal Knight &mdash; unless he&apos;s some devious cretin that is after my intimates.</p><p>&emsp;After I back away from the window and toss the bloody dagger in the sink, I approach the closet door. </p><p>&emsp;Or at least I thought it was a closet. </p><p>&emsp;The space beyond the door frame spans for less than a foot before the faint candlelight is swallowed by darkness. But the darkness is so dense and miasmic, like peering through murky water.</p><p>&emsp;The tunnel opens itself to me as I approach the door. From the lines implied by the floors and walls, the small cupboard should be no deeper than a couple feet (enough to store winter uniforms and snowshoes for the cold season), but I find no definite end. The edge where the splintered floor meets the jagged wall just fades into obscurity, all the way though to the unit on the other side, where an unfamiliar twinkle of multicolored lights pierce the smooth walls.</p><p>&emsp;The corridor might be short, but it&apos;s still just a little too long. The neighboring wall would have to be deeper than the walls around Fort Gaffesend!</p><p>&emsp;It must be a trick of his.  He could be a cross-blood like Pax, except Auvryan; able to mess with minds; skilled enough in his race&apos;s  gift to conjure convincing illusions with his Essence. Maybe that&apos;s why he seemed so powerless with his Human gifts. Maybe he conjured that splitting headache before I barged in, or maybe he speaks through thoughts, unaccustomed to verbal speech, speaking words of a foreign language though my mind heard something else. Is my mind being twisted further, to show something that isn&apos;t there? Does he still deceive me from beyond the door? I refuse to fall for this pathetic excuse of a trick, so I decide to test the bewildering portal.</p><p>&emsp;I reach first with my gauntlet, dragging through the viscous black as if collapsing spiderwebs. I notice the breeze at my back, strong enough to pierce the layers of my uniform, ushering me deeper and deeper. My trembling hand passes where the wall should be, and then my arm, and then the rest of my body, and as all the sound of the quaint cottage and the outside world fade behind me, I realize I&apos;m twice as deep as the rules of space should allow. I think of the old stories of the Verdalans, the masters of space whose bodies descended from the fibrous jungle, defending their ancient capital with an infinite wall of twisting jungle. Just as their Essence warped space, entrapping their adversaries in endless loops of attrition, I feel my stomach twist as my senses confirm a truth that the mind refuses to accept.</p>"},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"92","GivenName":"Enemies To Combatants","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Eight","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Nine","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":8,"ChapterFull":9,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":33,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"Final Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"31","Synopsis":"Differences lead to misunderstandings and violence.","Summary":"> Cody witnesses the fantasy world.> Katiya witnesses the contemporary world.> Cody prepares to fight Katiya.> Katiya fights Cody, part one.","VerboseID":"2.9","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"04/25/26","FantasyTime":"2A-128, 54th of Verdantide","StoryDay":"Saturday","Setting":"Unknown Location"},"DocName":"08 // &quot;Crossing the Threshold&quot;","Body":""},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":1,"AutoNameFull":23,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":8,"ChapterFull":9,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":1,"SceneFull":23,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":34,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"First Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Cody","UUID":"32","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.9.23","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-22","Body":"<p>&emsp;I wince at the pins and needles throbbing in my hand, thinking about how I&apos;m gonna borrow my cousin and her law degree and sue that damn bitch.

I&apos;ll take an Uber to the hospital before I call an ambulance.</p><p>&emsp;Cursing under my breath makes it easier to bear. I tear the sleeve off my muddy, bloodstained shirt so I can try to wrap it up, all while I try to remember the content of my middle school health class.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s the first time I&apos;m able to look around and take in my surroundings. The sky is overcast and pitch-dark, with none of Denver&apos;s light pollution obscuring the stars. A great body of water spans before me, which is puzzling: if I left the adjoining unit from the front, shouldn&apos;t Emerald Lake be a couple blocks away?</p><p>&emsp;My housing development is devoid of streetlights by design, but when I squint to see the lights that illuminate the road, they flicker. The roads are dirty. And as I grasp the fabric of my tattered shirt as tightly as I can, plotting a large, crimson cardioid, I wonder how the HOA could ever let things get this bad with how much they scalp me every month.</p><p>&emsp;A couple strangers approach. They hasten their walk when they find I&apos;m on my knees: two of them far larger than I am, but all four of them far more built.

I&apos;m distracted by how perfect their fursuit is: her eyes move away when I try to meet them, flicking the tail with some kind of servo or something.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What is going on in this suburb? Early Halloween? Did y&apos;all leave a D&D session? I thought it was all old people here,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Old people? This is the Millitary District,&quot; one of them says, &apos;casting fire&apos; in their palm to give us some light. I&apos;m impressed at how well they sell it.</p><p>&emsp;The darker-skinned bald one bends down to look at my palm, still taller than my crouch at half his height. &quot;You have got a good slice there. What happened?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Was it Chymaerans?&quot; The other lunk says.</p><p>&emsp;The others look at him disapprovingly.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Enough of the Chymaeran talk,&quot; says a woman with short, dirty blond hair. &quot;I&apos;ve got the training. I can heal him.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;As in a med-kit?&quot; I ask. &quot;Some peroxide and a bandage?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; She says, snarkily. &quot;Essence.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What is that?&quot; I expect it&apos;s an off-brand painkiller or holistic herbs, nothing better than a Band-Aid.</p><p>&emsp;She says, &quot;Look &mdash; do you want my help or not?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; I say. She groans in annoyance before taking my palm between her hands. &quot;Where&apos;s the Neighborhood Patrol? I thought the cops were supposed to be out since those kids went tagging at the pool,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What in Khiras&apos; name are you on about?&quot; The African-American one asks.

He who asks should give their name first,&quot; I say.

This is Jullian, Oria, Pax, and Naya,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;Might as well befriend the neighbors. &quot;I&apos;m Cody. Cody Dunsmore, and I just moved here.&quot; I realize I don&apos;t have a hand to shake: my left one is being healed with what feels like glove-warmers and LEDs.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Too strange for a Chymaeran,&quot; the lunk called Pax says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about your papers?&quot; Ryder asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh ... alright.&quot; The word &apos;papers&apos; is kinda weird, but I play along with their improv, in case they live close and I&apos;ll have to see them again.</p><p>&emsp;I reach into my back pocket with my right hand, but my wallet isn&apos;t there. I must have left it on the counter after I tipped the delivery guy.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hold on a sec,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;They reach for their swords though I can only reach one hand myself, all while Oriya is still &apos;working her magic.&apos;</p><p>&emsp;I retrieve my phone from my pocket. They stare as if it were some kind of monolith. I light the screen with a tap then swipe up to turn on the flashlight.</p><p>&emsp;Click.</p><p>&emsp;They instantly dive backwards, frightened when the blinding flash illuminates the streets brighter than the flickering lamps.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Good thing I downloaded the MyColorado App recently, in case the cops stop me and I forgot my license. Let&apos;s see here . . .&quot; I swipe down to type M-Y-C in the search bar, and then tap the first result.</p><p>&emsp;They&apos;re still petrified, standing there with their swords drawn.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Very funny. You guys are great at improv,&quot; I say. &quot;See? Right here. Class C. I can drive, officer.&quot; I hold the bright screen towards Ryder. He draws closer, entranced by the display.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What kind of magic is this? Are you some kind of mage? An inventor in the Royal Court of Science? Or are you a Mask? Of the Gods?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m just an engineer,&quot; I tell them. &quot;Hardly one at that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;An inventor, then,&quot; Jullian says.</p><p>&emsp;I look to the full-on furry catgirl.

It&apos;s going to&mdash;&quot; I flex my hand. It feels like nothing. I turn the flashlight from the roadway, looking down at my palm.</p><p>&emsp;I turn to Oriya. &quot;How in God&apos;s name did you do that? Did you glue it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, idiot. You&apos;re Human, aren&apos;t you? Don&apos;t you have the powers of fire and life?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No?&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, get on home,&quot; Oriya says. The others ramble to themselves about the strangeness of what just happened. Oriya reaches to hug Jullian&apos;s arm, and he uncomfortably obliges. I wait until the four of them disappear into the shadows.</p><p>&emsp;I try the handle of the door.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s locked.</p><p>&emsp;I run around the back, onto a cobblestone street. Counting as many houses over as it took to turn the corner, I try the window.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s open.</p><p>&emsp;I flex my left hand, still not feeling any anguish, pressing my ear to the window to try and discern where the girl is.

The room is dark, and though I can&apos;t make out the meager spread of items, I can sense how strange the shapes in this room are: so smooth and straight, as if they were cut by divine hands. When I find a glint in the artifacts on the shelves and walls&mdash;even the shelves themselves&mdash;I marvel at how much metal must have been wasted to produce all these things. He must be rich if he can waste money like this: maybe he&apos;s so rich that he bribed the Guard to let him live here, in a prime spot looking across the water.</p><p>&emsp;Does he actually live next door? Did I really mistake this as a closet? My metal boots clatter like hooves against the reflective wood floor, and I trace my finger along the polished granite table, trying to imagine how the resources got here.</p><p>&emsp;A crunch startles me. On the floor are what looks like hand-painted ration cans, but they&apos;re all crushed and ruined.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m startled again when I hear snoring in the corner, and I find another odd stranger. A friend? A lover? Maybe a visitor past curfew? My feet sink into the carpet when I approach him, wondering again how the scruffy noble could ever afford such luxurious flooring.</p><p>&emsp;The entire room stinks of man, but this one smells especially bad. He mumbles in a drunken stupor before he awakes, blinking his eyes like a toad.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh . . . hey.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hello,&quot; I say, wishing I had not ditched the dagger.</p><p>&emsp;He asks, &quot;And you are?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya. Katiya Breakey-Hilde,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Carajo. My homie&apos;s got no chill if he&apos;s bringing girls like you over while I&apos;m here. Must be desperate since he&apos;s got no hose.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A hose? Why would you&mdash;&quot; I begin to ask, but he cuts me off.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I think he&apos;s upstairs,&quot; he tells me, squinting his eyes, and then some semblance of recognition crosses his face. &quot;Wait a minute &mdash; you must be from that fantasy escort service down in Denver, what was it called, uh . . . Call To Adventure, or something like that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I only do escort missions through the Royal Guard,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hah. Good one,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It is good,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Good.&quot; He clicks his tongue. &quot;Figures. My boy Cody could never score a baddie like you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;An odd name.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;m Miguel.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Another odd name.</p><p>&emsp;He says, &quot;But he&apos;s a real one, let me tell you. My friend is the best dude you&apos;ll ever meet. I love that guy. You might be here for just a night &mdash; and, look, I know the whole thing about falling in love with a call girl &mdash; but give him a chance, huh? Even if it&apos;s just a booty call thing,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;His hand grazes the table, accidentally casting some black, slender object on the floor. It bounces twice before colliding with something else.</p><p>&emsp;I hear a click, and then behind me, a flash of colorful light envelops the room. I gasp when I turn to look, and my heart jumps into my throat.</p><p>&emsp;Behind the bright window, a mother and daughter are screaming at each other. It gives me such a start that I collapse into the couch. The woman is screaming, the daughter is screaming, I&apos;m screaming, and the man is shouting, trying to free himself from my armor.</p><p>&emsp;I spew a string of apologies as the woman in the window says something about wanting her body back, just as all I want is to go home. Too panicked to realize that the best direction is from whence I came, I sprint for the door as the other guy curses, grasping his leg.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;ll just go around like Cody. We&apos;ll trade places.</p><p>&emsp;Just like my intruder, I trip backwards out the door, scraping the edges of the cement with my plate armor as I slide down the sculpted stairs, coming directly to a stop beneath a blinding torchlight. I scramble to my feet to try and run, but everything is so bright and unfamiliar that I fall to my knees.</p><p>&emsp;The sky is cloudless, but I can&apos;t find a single star. Lake Garrison is nowhere to be found; instead of the distant lights of my hometown of Hillfar, a pattern of white-and-red dotted lights slide past each other on a hill, somewhere far beyond the eaves of two houses on the other side of the road.</p><p>&emsp;Something loud is approaching. I try to curl into a ball to protect myself, but the armor stiffens me too much. A massive automobile tears past, lighting the entire street with headlamps lodged in the front, unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen. It sounds like they have an entire orchestra in there behind the glass, but the deafening music fades . . . only to be replaced by two more loud metal chariots that shake the ground.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m quivering as I lay there in the grass, wondering where the garden is; why the lake isn&apos;t directly across from me; why stars shifted in the sky so swiftly. </p><p>&emsp;An old woman walks on the side of the street, and I consider she&apos;s a lamplighter until I see her holding a leash. She notices me crumpled in the grass on the verge of tears.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Are you alright, sweetheart?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I cry.</p><p>&emsp;Her familiar crosses the grass, nuzzling me with its wet nose before it licks my face.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, that&apos;s Doby. She&apos;s real friendly with all the young&apos;uns living around here &mdash; do you mind dogs? Or are you more of a cat person?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m a human person. A living human&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;I swear to the good Lord in heaven: if this neighborhood is turning into one of those &apos;college&apos; towns the Facebook talks about, with all these young&apos;uns in their new houses playing trapping music, I&apos;m going to lose it!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I haven&apos;t the time to protest when I hear a hissing noise, and it sounds like the elder is conjuring a serpent. Before I can react, I feel a cloudless rain, followed by a direct blast of water to my face, saturating the clothes beneath my armor in seconds.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why? Why do you torment me?&quot; I plead, my tears now inseparable from the water soaking me down to my underwear. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t set the timer on those sprinklers,&quot; she says, and then adds, &quot;damn beatnik.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;As I kneel in the muddy grass, sullying my new pants, I watch as the cantankerous woman retreats, dragging the mutt alongside her. A single, white moon hangs in the sky. Blinking red and white flashes somewhere even higher, casting smoke in a faint line, leaving the sound of a crackle as it slices the sky.

The inebriated man called Cody holds the odd, metallic broomstick with his hands together in the center &mdash; a technique I&apos;ve never seen before &mdash; and calls out a phrase I can only decipher as a challenge.</p><p>&emsp;If it&apos;s a sword fight he wants, I know I can make it to the greatsword leaning against the wall, because if this Auvryan cross-blood wants to wreak havoc on my home life with his illusions, sullying the most sacred place I have to replenish myself and find respite, then I have no other choice. </p><p>&emsp;He must be destroyed.</p><p>&emsp;Cody drags his left foot behind him, bending his knees, leaning his body in a forward squat as if that can stop me. Surely this assassin is an Auvryan, and likely some kind of mercenary: their people are masters with pole weapons. But I doubt his technique is greater than the strength of a full-blooded Human flooded with Essence.</p><p>&emsp;I charge with my armored left shoulder, allowing the Essence to flow into my legs, flooding my muscles with such power that every step deflects the floorboards. I close the distance faster than he expects, but he remains steadfast, standing there with the metal broom raised to chest height, hinging his arms to receive the full force of my momentum.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s when I&apos;m three steps from deliverance that he bends to get under me &mdash; but my muscle memory is far faster. I lower myself further than he can, sliding beneath the pole, driving my metallic shoulder into his chest and blasting him in the air.</p><p>&emsp;He lets out a rasping wheeze when his ribs bend towards his lungs. He&apos;s lucky that nothing inside him breaks: maybe it&apos;s the alcohol on his breath that hints that his muscles are loose, and that he&apos;s feeling a little braver than he might be otherwise.  Cody crashes against my wall, leaving a sizable divot in the aged wallpaper, and before the ground reclaims him, I manage to snag the greatsword with my left hand, dragging it across the floor to assume a defensive stance. </p><p>&emsp;Somehow, he still manages to death-grip the broom between his hands, coughing and gasping for air as he lifts himself to his feet, overflowing with adrenaline and rage that radiate in his reddening face.</p><p>&emsp;I realize I left him an opening to escape. I expect him to cower, retreating to his conjured illusion to never return. But he flips the broom end of the stick to face him, exposing a sharp, hollow edge. </p><p>&emsp;His hapless courage is admirable. Maybe I would have fallen for him if this were training, and we were on the same side of the war.</p><p>&emsp;Cody coughs. &quot;You couldn&apos;t just let me go, could you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I need to be sure you can&apos;t ever ruin my peace again.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He takes several labored breaths, clutching his chest, swinging the sharp end of the broom in several circles. &quot;So you&apos;re trying to kill me, then?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not my fault that you broke in.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I was trying to tell you that the door was open. What the hell kind of neighbor are you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re not strong enough to be my neighbor,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;The ceiling has just enough clearance to swing the greatsword in a vertical slash. I expect this cumbersome move to give him enough of a start to really escape this time, but he still refuses, standing there with the stick between his hands. </p><p>&emsp;The sword traces a faint line in the wooden ceiling before gravity does the rest of the work. It clashes with the broom &mdash; and I fully expect it to break through &mdash; but all my greatsword does is well a deep notch in the hexagonal shaft.</p><p>&emsp;He mutters something about the material, cursing about how this broom is personal to him, but I know very little of the Auvrya or their traditions. My blade releases sparks when I try to pull it back, grinding against the notch, but the further I pull, the higher the blade climbs. </p><p>&emsp;I hear the screech of metal-on-metal, and it seems it&apos;s his turn to close the distance. He grinds the pole against the sharp edge, driving the sword higher and higher until it falls behind my hands. I&apos;m left defenseless, and he jabs the plastic head of the stick against my breastplate, driving me to the floor.</p>"},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"92","GivenName":"Strategic Retreat","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Nine","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Ten","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":9,"ChapterFull":10,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":38,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"Final Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"36","Synopsis":"Katiya struggles to shut out the intruder.","Summary":"> Katiya finishes the fight and the two separate.> Katiya calms her panic, and finds Cody&apos;s iPod.> Katiya uncomfortably goes to work with Jullian and others.

I level the dagger at him, taking a butcher&apos;s knife in my other hand, completely unsure of what he&apos;s going to do next.</p><p>&emsp;His hands shift to the sharp end of the stick, leaving the basket at a certain length behind him. </p><p>&emsp;Then he whips it down as hard as he can. </p><p>&emsp;The apple whizzes past my head, exploding against the stone wall, casting chunks of its sugary flesh and skin into my hair.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I should have practiced since the club team sophomore year,&quot; he says, slurring his words. &quot;Next one&apos;s going corner-pocket in your damn eye socket.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not if I end you first,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;The assassin scoops up an orange with a single flick of his wrist.

He freezes. I set the dagger on the counter, taking three more kitchen knives into my left hand, certain that I can hit dead-center now that my dominant hand is free.</p><p>&emsp;I whip a second one, letting the Essence tension the fibers of my muscles, launching the paring knife faster than an arrow. </p><p>&emsp;But he&apos;s already pitching up the overturned kitchen table. </p><p>&emsp;The tablecloth hovers to the floor like melting ectoplasm before the paring knife pins it to the table. Cody lets out a yelp in fear, surely unhurt since the blade is far shallower than the thick mahogany. </p><p>&emsp;I decide to upgrade to a carving knife, withdrawing all five inches from the block. I judge its balance. </p><p>&emsp;He peeks from behind the table, and I whip the carving knife where I expect his chest to be, thinking it&apos;s his body that braces the table upright. </p><p>&emsp;But he bends back. </p><p>&emsp;It stabs through almost up to the handle.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Holy hell,&quot; he exclaims.</p><p>&emsp;I wind up to throw another as he pulls the small knife from the wallpaper, then throw it. The boring knife spins through the air, nearly pinning his hand to the wall. He catches me off guard when he emerges from the side of the table. I reach for another culinary weapon, but I realize my offhand is out of blades.</p><p>&emsp;The oddly-dressed assassin flips the blade to set the sharp edge between his fingers, his eyes dark and piercing as he raises his elbow and lifts the knife behind his head. The panic seizes my heart: this assassin&apos;s skilled enough to engage a vetted Royal Guard when he&apos;s two sheets to the wind. I&apos;m certain a knife will soon be in my chest, and all I can do is ready myself for the deliverance of cold steel.</p><p>&emsp;And then he throws it.</p><p>&emsp;I expect it to fly so fast that I can&apos;t catch a glimpse of its glistening edge before it embeds itself between my breastplate. I expect my consciousness to end, to wash in the next fated moment upon the Reservoir of Souls. </p><p>&emsp;But I can see it.</p><p>&emsp;And it&apos;s not coming at me.</p><p>&emsp;It flies so far to the right that I wonder if he&apos;s aiming at something else. The paring knife spins horizontally through the air, twirling and spinning with such disarray that it only makes it halfway to the kitchen before it clatters against the floor.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Damn it!&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;The laugh escapes before my hands cover my mouth. I can&apos;t even stop the loud snort. His face is crestfallen, even more hurt than the time I rammed him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You should stick with that strange basket-stick of yours,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;Cody&apos;s voice wavers. &quot;It&apos;s called a lacrosse stick,&quot; he says, blushing hard, peeking over the edge with his glasses as he struggles to withdraw the carving knife from the other side. </p><p>&emsp;I thought he was an Auvryan mind-flayer &mdash; a mythical master of mental manipulation, maybe commissioned by the Chymaera. But he&apos;s no warrior. Just a stupidly-brave commoner that&apos;s overconfident in his skills. And a complete idiot.</p><p>&emsp;I can&apos;t stop laughing. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What are you, some kind of combat janitor? Do you sweep floors with that thing?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;His face reddens further, whether it&apos;s the booze, his humiliation, or both.  I feel the relief wash over me as the Essence retreats from my circuits. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Gods above, for a second I thought you were an actual threat,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Who says I&apos;m not?&quot; He scoops a tomato into the &apos;cross stick&apos;, poised to whip another one.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just . . . stop,&quot; I tell him. &quot;I&apos;m not going to kill a civilian.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe you should reconsider,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Consider this.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I raise my hands and cast a controlled plume of flames. He flinches when they stop only inches from his face, dropping something hard and small from his pocket. He has to steady himself with the odd weapon as he stumbles towards the closet.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Really, Cody. Do you even understand our training? How much Essence a Royal Guard is conditioned with? How much mead does it take to get this kind of courage? I could snap your bones with my hands!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m your neighbor. I live right next door . . . through there,&quot; he says, lifting a bare arm exposed by his scalded shirt to point towards the closet. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why are you living in the military district?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I live in Hearthland Ridge,&quot; he insists. &quot;The military base is down in Cheyenne, or maybe Fort Carson.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is Gaffesend,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, this is Colorado. The United States,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nothing is united in all of Fosroth. You can&apos;t be stupid enough to be a tourist at the war front!&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The war is overseas. It&apos;s fought with drones and bombs.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s waged with swords and rifles!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I approach him until I can smell the booze on his breath. My eyes flutter between his exposed chest and his arms, a little impressed at his definition when he obviously has no Essence. I catch him glimpsing at my bare thighs that once straddled him, and then to my breastplate, before returning my glare and slowly backing up towards the closet.</p><p>&emsp;But his heels catch on the threshold.</p><p>&emsp;He falls through the portal, unable to steady himself with his weapon before he crashes to the ground on the other side. I take one more glance at the horrors of that incomprehensible world: all its glistening, colored lights like Essenced lightning bugs. The fear forestalls me from passing that threshold ever again, so I stand there: watching; waiting; listening to the faintness of his breath; until I&apos;m certain his intemperance will keep him there.</p><p>&emsp;But the fear of that other world overpowers my penchant for patience. I slam the door behind him, certain I&apos;ll never have to face that stranger again.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":28,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":9,"ChapterFull":10,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":28,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":40,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"First Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"38","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.10.28","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-27","Body":"<p>&emsp;I dig my heels into the space between the floorboards, catching my breath as I drive my back against the closet door. My nails tension against the pad of my palm, leaving crescents in my flesh as the blood drains from my fingertips. </p><p>&emsp;My heart can only take so much in a day. I thought the enemy could only strike when my presence was voluntary; when I patrol the borders of Gaffesend by my own volition. And it only took a day for this peaceful haven to be violated by a stranger.</p><p>&emsp;I can&apos;t keep sitting here. The curse will catch me if I don&apos;t get up: the white feeling that tensions my hands and sets my body in full static.  The shorter the time between those moments of frantic stillness, the easier it slides into that incontrovertible state of shock. It&apos;s addiction without a pleasure to be addicted to, and the more often that white feeling haunts me, the stronger it gets &mdash; so I&apos;m glad when I find my effects are still scattered across the floor. A mess to clean is the second-best thing to distract me right now: the first is going to the bar, but after my episode, I&apos;d rather not be seen in public.</p><p>&emsp;I let my mind flow with visions of how I can transform this space into a place of respite, rather than feeling like an ephemeral halfway-house between training and the front lines.  The mind is a vessel that can only hold so much at a time, so I drink to the the purity of those beautiful thoughts, driving down the opacity of fear&apos;s murky brine. The pale white feeling fades as the light begins to shine through, reaching my furthest depths.</p><p>&emsp;When my hands stave off the static, I gather the courage to seal that passageway forever. </p><p>&emsp;I let the Essence flood my circuits with enough heat to melt the handle of the closet door to the deadbolt, ensuring it&apos;s locked forever. Then I drag an empty bookcase across the floor to cover it. It irritates me that it&apos;s slightly spaced from the wall due to the protrusion of the melted handle, so I melt the rest of it, turning the balled handle into a flat plate pressed against the profile of the wooden door, deciding it&apos;s good enough to try to forget.</p><p>&emsp;I lack the Auvryan magic of mind, but I hypnotize myself anyway. </p><p>&emsp;The bookcase has always been here.</p><p>&emsp;Next, I purge anything that reminds me of him. </p><p>&emsp;I wipe his blood from the dagger. I return the fruit scattered across the floor into the bowl. I pull the kitchen knives from the overturned table and reset the tablecloth the other way around, covering the gaping holes in the wood. Finding the evidence is still in the fabric, I sew the clean cuts in the tablecloth closed with thread from my sewing kit. I mop and dab all the puddles and smudges. This leads to finding places for the hundred pounds of my unpacked personal items, placing them anywhere but the closet I should have forgotten, which leads to re-orienting all the decorations and furniture and bookshelf to make the space my own, which leads to dusting every surface I can find. Before long, I find my exasperated body sprawled across the kitchen&apos;s area rug, drugged by the excitement of exertion, staring at the cross-beams of the low wooden ceiling with a slight smile on my face. </p><p>&emsp;I hoped so dearly that this distraction would let me forget. </p><p>&emsp;But even still, I find the urge to reconcile that impossibility.</p><p>&emsp;I need to keep moving. I need to find something to fix when I can&apos;t leave this house. Since I can&apos;t patch the dent in the wall, I decide to look harder for any dust that might coalesce beneath the cabinets. I roll over to find the duster did its job well, but there&apos;s something else tucked under there.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s a strange, slender, rectangular object beneath the cutout of the kitchen cabinet. Like all the other things in his realm, it&apos;s perfectly smooth and square &mdash; but I can tell it&apos;s been worn from years and years of continuous use. It would look like an ingot if it wasn&apos;t so flat: hardly enough for a blacksmith to smelt it into anything. When I turn the heavy block in my hands, I find that I&apos;m able to read the foreign words on the back, etched in white beneath an image of a bitten fruit:</p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>LOVE YOU JACKIE D</span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>FROM CODY 2010</span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>MERRY CHRISTMAS</span></p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>160 GB</span></p><p>&emsp;A set of long, slender wires snake from the bottom of it, ending with white buds that look like they could grow into flowers. Does it work with electricity? Because it&apos;s certainly not plugged in to anything.</p><p>&emsp;A light tug pulls out the buds by their roots. I panic for a second until I realize I&apos;ll never have to return this thing to him. </p><p>&emsp;When I jam the buds&apos; metal root back into the hole, the dark square on the front turns on, glowing with an impossible, radiant white, labeled with options in black. </p><p>&emsp;It takes me a while to figure it out, but when my finger glides on the circle, the little window changes. I settle the black bar on PICTURES, expecting a photograph to dispense from the tiny slot in the bottom. </p><p>&emsp;I press the center button. </p><p>&emsp;But instead, the window shows a gateway to an entirely different world. It reminds me of the moving projections that I heard were in the theatre rooms of the capital, though this one is so impossibly small &mdash; and there&apos;s not a creature in existence that could roll the image from inside. It reminds me of the screaming woman behind the window on the stranger&apos;s wall.</p><p>&emsp;There&apos;s so many tiny squares of color that make this picture, but it&apos;s still hard to make out. Two people sit at a table in a stone-walled room lit by a very bright lamp. One is small: just a boy, and the other is older, wearing some kind of green-and-brown uniform &mdash; sharp enough in dress that I figure he&apos;s a warrior.</p><p>&emsp;All I can tell is that they care for each other: sitting together building something metallic and square with wires hanging off of it. And they have this same device there, sharing the white buds between their ears. </p><p>&emsp;I try the same with the round white shapes, but nothing happens. I click another button on the side. The screen goes black, reflecting my eyes on its worn, yet polished surface, and when I realize how time has passed, I look up at the hands of the clock. </p><p>&emsp;Dear Gods above: a whole hour has passed. If I don&apos;t sleep now, dusk will overtake any chance of rest.</p><p>&emsp;I run upstairs with the device in my hand, leaving the square pod and its tangled wires as the first decoration on my nightstand. My body is exhausted from all the fear, and I don&apos;t have to even draw the covers to find myself in slumber. I just collapse onto the bed, retreating into a deep sleep where the smoke of the cabin across the lake never reaches me.</p><p>&emsp;My mind remembers the contours of Cody&apos;s body beneath the tattered shirt.

And after I dress myself in light armor for another day of chores, I throw open the door to find two others have joined us.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian stands behind Bertram with Oriya, and he offers an explanation I never asked for. &quot;She wanted to join us on the walk over, she asked me last night.

From what all the senior guards say, it seems like junior scouting missions carry light expectations.

I want to know that he remembers. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why don&apos;t you tell her, Jullian?&quot; I ask. I think he&apos;ll stammer for a second, but he&apos;s quick, so much that it almost sounds rehearsed.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure.

It was the second-to-last semester, late one night when I was returning from an exam. I had to take my brother to the academy because I was watching him, and as we&apos;re walking home, he sees this beautiful girl passing us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How old was your brother?&quot; Oriya asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He was eight,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;Anyways, I must have been ranting to him about how little time I have for anything, because, get this &mdash; he walks straight up to her, tugs on her shirt, and says, &apos;Hey lady: my brother is lonely and sad: can you fix him?&apos;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Really?&quot; Oriya turns to me. &quot;And that worked on you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess so,&quot; I say. &quot;I have little half-siblings, too, so I guess I have a soft spot for that impudence. There wasn&apos;t really anyone there for me at the time, and with so much coming after graduation, I was willing to give him a chance.&quot; I only realize what I implied when I look to Bertram.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian says, &quot;I was a loner. I thought I wasn&apos;t worthy, that I was a loser, that nothing would ever work out for me. But Katiya blessed me with something I&apos;d never felt before. And sometimes I&apos;m still not sure I deserve it.&quot; I think he intends it as a joke, but there&apos;s just enough substance that it makes the others feel uncomfortable.</p><p>&emsp;It makes me feel so warm when I remember how great he was with my two half-siblings. How he&apos;d wait for me every night after classes, and we&apos;d stay up until the morning just talking about our lives, until a couple months passed and we were brave enough to explore something else in each other. </p><p>&emsp;But he almost looks sad sharing these memories: holding the same expression on his face I found when we drew closer to graduation, when after challenging each other for months and months to be at our best, we climbed the ranks high enough to be withheld from direct service. It was on the week-long trip to Gaffesend that I saw the biggest change. Before that, he was right on the threshold of opening up, but after a week with his first group of guy friends, following them around to pubs in every layover town on the way to Gaffe, he started to feel colder, almost as distant as when I first met him and had to warm him up.</p><p>&emsp;I still find his eyes wander to other faces when we walk together, even right now, gaging reactions, forever looking for something he can&apos;t find. But with all the wonderful times we shared together, how far we opened up to each other, I&apos;m certain that it&apos;s still there, regardless of how the conditions have changed.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re still so young,&quot; he mutters, just between the two of us.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know,&quot; I tell him. &quot;How is that relevant?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He pauses, as if he meant to think it. &quot;But my future is always with you.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;The familiar nervous tick rises where he scratches at his arms. I still wait to hear those three words. We were so close before it felt like graduation changed everything, and part of me wishes we started earlier.</p><p>&emsp;We approach the quest board outside the re-purposed adventurer&apos;s guild building, swarming with junior guards. We submit our forms from yesterday for a sign-off. I apologize to Bertram, though he insists he knows what I meant, and I offer for the two of us to take on a quest together.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I think we should do a scouting quest together,&quot; he says. &quot;How about a close one?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Jullian overhears us as he talks with his friends. I can tell he&apos;s trying to mask that he&apos;s actively listening.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not sure,&quot; I say. &quot;I think we should do something close.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is the chance to take that next step, you know. I know we can do it. You and me, together. Nothing&apos;s going to happen.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not today,&quot; I say, &quot;but next time. I assure you. I just don&apos;t think I&apos;m ready yet.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Even during the day?&quot; Bertram asks. I can feel his disappointment weigh on my self-image. &quot;It&apos;s just the other bank. Please, no more potato harvesting: my nails need a damn rest.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then scouting the city?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But in the forest, you can actually sit down most of the time. Make camp and relax, as long as you&apos;re quiet enough to listen.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sure, but&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He pauses, realizing how his insistence weighs on me. &quot;No. No, it&apos;s fine,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m wrong. I&apos;m sorry to push you. We can&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s alright, Bertram. I&apos;ll take one of the domestic quests alone: you go ahead.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, but . . . are you sure?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sure,&quot; I say, watching his bright blue eyes fill with hesitation, though I&apos;ve known him long enough to tell when there&apos;s something he really wants. &quot;Really. Go on, I&apos;ll catch up with you after.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;O-okay, then,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe tomorrow, then?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; and then I add, &quot;Maybe. Sure.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The masses begin moving for the shoreline to catch a boat across the lake. Julian stops me as I turn with the few stragglers heading for the mainland.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;d really like it if you&apos;d come with us,&quot; he says. The group of guys and girls look impatient, beginning to suspect something&apos;s off about me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s alright. I&apos;d rather do stuff closer to home,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay?&quot; I almost expected more of a fight, more of an effort towards persuasion, but he turns to join the receding group before I have a chance to protest. Oriya is the only one waiting for him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll catch up with you later,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; I mutter. But he&apos;s already too far away to hear it. I look down at the quest sheet I tore from behind all the other postings, wondering where this shameful feeling of unease will deposit me today.</p>"},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"90","GivenName":"Surprise Approach","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Ten","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Eleven","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":10,"ChapterFull":11,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":42,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"Final Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"40","Synopsis":"Changes at work put Cody on the edge.","Summary":"> Cody finishes the weekend then heads to work to receive news of layoffs.> Reed Broderick is hired despite weakening job security.","VerboseID":"2.11","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"04/27/26","FantasyTime":"2A-128, 56th of Verdantide","StoryDay":"Undefined","Setting":"Hearthland Ridge Estates"},"DocName":"10 // &quot;Surprise Approach&quot;","Body":""},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":1,"AutoNameFull":30,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":10,"ChapterFull":11,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":1,"SceneFull":30,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":43,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"First Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Cody","UUID":"41","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.11.30","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-29","Body":"<p>&emsp;Late Sunday morning, around 11:00, I awoke with my neck twisted against the closet door, my face saturated with drool, shirt missing, and a sticky note taped to my forehead with Miguel&apos;s handwriting that read &quot;DRINK WATER.&quot; The pounding headache had mostly subsided: I must have slept it off, or drank loads of water the night before from how quickly I immediately had to sprint to the restroom. And after relieving myself, I found my phone on the counter with three unread texts:</p><p><span class=msgfromdate>Miguel Ruelas // 06:37</span></p><p><span class=msgfrom>u gotta tell me whassup with that wack cosplay chick. neighbor? break-in? u invite rollplay hookers over when i was asleep?</span></p><p><span class=msgfromdate>Miguel Ruelas // 07:13</span></p><p><span class=msgfrom>or shit maybe I dreamt it, doesnt explain the bruise on my leg unless something happened that i forgot</span></p><p><span class=msgfromdate>Miguel Ruelas // 07:14</span></p><p><span class=msgfrom>anyways congrats bro on the house. lets catch up next week im off to church. cleaned up some of the mess. love u bro</span></p><p>&emsp;I looked around to find that the madman actually cleaned everything. The pillows were arranged on the couch, the beer cans sorted into the recycling bin outside, and even the counters looked like he gave them a clean wipe. I responded: </p><p><span class=msgtodate>Cody Dunsmore // 11:12</span></p><p><span class=msgto>Thanks for cleaning up dude, you didn&apos;t have to do that! Let&apos;s chill next weekend. Not much else to do when everyone moved away :/</span></p><p>&emsp;Feeling disgusting, I rushed upstairs to take a shower, getting off the sweat and stench of a failed all-nigher. My shower thoughts brought me back to that dream in another world: getting slashed by a crazy roleplayer and encountering strangers in some semi-modern renaissance world. I looked down at my left hand, as if the warm shower water wasn&apos;t enough to tell me whether or not the flesh parted like a bad haircut. But all I found was smooth skin. </p><p>&emsp;It must have been a shared dream, like Inception, because I still don&apos;t recall inviting anyone over: hell, I don&apos;t even know who to call. But as the scalding water relieves the pounding in my head, I find that all I can think of is the magical woman I fought in my dreams, how she straddled me, threw knives at me, and cleaved that heavy greatsword straight into the middle of my lacrosse stick. </p><p>&emsp;I dried myself off before a different kind of pleasure could emerge from those thoughts: I was more absorbed by the strangeness of that vivid and continuous dream. My curiosity led me to try opening the door to the closet, finding another door behind it that looked as if its handle were blasted with a blowtorch. </p><p>&emsp;I just assumed I&apos;d forgotten there was no closet. Were these pre-builds originally intended for a hotel chain or something with the neighbor door? It didn&apos;t make sense at all, but I knew I wouldn&apos;t feel safe, and I was actively looking for any kind of excuse to make something stupid in my robotics workshop. </p><p>&emsp;After a drive-thru breakfast, I went to the home improvement store to get one of those school-shooter-stopping door stops: one level shy of something permanent like bolting the damn door in place. With a spare microcontroller, I hooked up a hall-effect sensor and a buzzer &mdash; a magnet sensor and a loud speaker, basically &mdash; to detect if that door was ever to move. By soldering the wires to the breadboard, along with some AA batteries, and using generous dollops of hot glue to stick it to the inside wall of the strange-looking door, I called it a day around 9:30 PM, returning to my bed for an early night of sleep so I could get up tomorrow, only to spend four hours doom-scrolling through the week&apos;s sordid politics. </p><p>&emsp;I consider all these details right now when I&apos;m driving ten over the speed limit. It&apos;s not wondering if the notched cut in my lacrosse stick was from when Miguel and I were drunkenly tossing a tennis ball outside, nor is it my missing iPod Classic. It&apos;s how I could have possibly screwed myself over this bad. </p><p>&emsp;I set three alarms. Either my dumb ass shut them off in succession, I slept through them, or I did bad math in figuring out the absolute latest I could wake up, forgetting that I had to take a shower. Now I&apos;m screaming down the highway, hating myself as I KNOW that I&apos;m going to either make it right on time or a couple minutes too late. </p><p>&emsp;I skipped breakfast when that ulcerous, cantankerous feeling arrested my stomach, running the numbers over and over and over about how long it would take me to get there. Now I calculate every second as I pull into the last roadway snaking up into the canyon, taking tight turns that jostle my backpack against the back seat, nearly screeching my tires when I pull up to the front gate. </p><p>&emsp;Eight fifty-three on the dashboard. </p><p>&emsp;The gate guard waves me through. Apparently two years is long enough for him to remember my face. I clip the badge to my wrinkled work shirt and gather my bag when my Subaru fits in the last spot available, sneaking in the back door. </p><p>&emsp;Eight fifty-eight. </p><p>&emsp;I sneak in with the technicians finishing their first union-mandated break. The ones I worked with make fun of me for being lazy, calling me an &quot;eighter-skater&quot;. </p><p>&emsp;Eight fifty-nine. </p><p>&emsp;I climb the stairs. The rows of cubes are empty, and the sinking feeling deepens. What room is the meeting in? Was it thirty minutes earlier? I&apos;ll have to guess since I didn&apos;t check mail or Teams. </p><p>&emsp;Nine o&apos;clock. </p><p>&emsp;I try to calm my breathing or else I&apos;ll embarass myself further. Fuck, the door&apos;s shut. I open the door with a pad and paper in my other hand, meeting six sets of eyes as I retreat to the back, not a chair left for me to sit in. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Barely on time, Cody,&quot; Nav says. In the dark room, his face is only lit by the computer, and the window of emails is up on the projector. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I&mdash;&quot; don&apos;t add kindling to the fire by using an excuse: I find I&apos;m mostly out after this many years. </p><p>&emsp;Navesh continues. &quot;As I was saying. I swear to be transparent with all of you when it comes to this stuff. They monitor what they tell me, because they know I&apos;ll just regurgitate it back to all of you, because you deserve that honesty,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;Our team looks on with a knot in their stomachs: to my left, the Robinson-Monroe lifers Wilford Sameshima, a mechanical, and Michael Leguziamo, an electrical. To my right, Kei Sakurajima tensions her nails against her slender arm as she watches me for my own reaction, and mid-rank electrical Scott Valdez buries his face in his notepad. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;You all know the Aerospace Division was expecting the contract. Which means power cell assemblies to design, which means busy work making our existing models fit to their demands,&quot; Nav says. </p><p>&emsp;Kei types something into her open computer. My wrist vibrates when she hits the return key: </p><p><span class=msgfromdate>SAKURA_KEI 09:02:15:</span></p><p><span class=msgfrom>I thought I had tenure?</span></p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s an inside joke from when we had several electives together, when a professor was fired right in front of us. She cracks a smile that she fights to hide, trying to lighten the tension just a little. The humor joins the emotions inside my chest like adding oil to water, and not much for words right now, I respond. </p><p><span class=msgtodate>DUNSMO_COD 09:02:43:</span></p><p><span class=msgto>Guess not.</span></p><p>&emsp;Scott interjects, &quot;So when are we looking at here? For the . . . reduction of staff.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Even the lifers are afraid, tenured with all their tribal knowledge. Wilbur says, &quot;How many per group? I mean, we have a small team.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Nav predicates his next words with a warning. &quot;Now, I&apos;m not sure about any of this because they refuse to tell it straight. We&apos;re looking at one to two people, maybe. And we&apos;re looking at just before Christmas.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just in time to get gifts for my kids,&quot; I say, before realizing I&apos;ve spoken. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;You don&apos;t have kids,&quot; Kei says. </p><p>&emsp;A nervous chuckle circles the room. Nav looks relieved that I tried to ligthen things: it feels like the first time I&apos;ve been really useful to this team in a month. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;re probably going to ask me to make a list again, just like I did three years ago, some of you willl remember that. They&apos;re going to force me to rank you. And I&apos;m sure you all know generally where you stand.&quot; I feel him staring at me through the back of his head: he doesn&apos;t have to turn around. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;A team of six is already pretty damn small,&quot; Mike says, mumbling into his folded hands. &quot;We&apos;re probably the smallest in the company already.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Which might mean we&apos;re fine. But it&apos;s not just six of us anymore,&quot; Nav says. I can see the notification come across his computer: one of the executives is waiting to enter the meeting after it is over. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask, feeling my heart skip a beat. If it&apos;s HR, that means the reaper is taking someone away. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s seven now. We vetted him before we lost the contract,&quot; Navesh says. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Did he even interview?&quot; Kei asks. &quot;I don&apos;t think any of us were there to get to know them.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;The executive walks in: it&apos;s my boss&apos; boss, dressed to the nines, probably lost since someone like him would never even bother to step into a wing of the company like ours. Behind him is a dark-haired, clean-cut guy dressed like any of us used to: slacks, a belt, and a tucked-in collared shirt. Feels like we should stand at attention for such seniority, but I&apos;m already up. The new recruit isn&apos;t nervous at all in introducing himself. </p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":31,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":10,"ChapterFull":11,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":31,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":44,"Label":"Polishing Revision","Status":"First Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"42","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.11.31","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-30","Body":"<p>&emsp;&quot;Nice to meet you all.

The animals all reach their hands for the box, but I lean further against the wall. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;So where are you from, Reed?&quot; Michael asks, his mouth full of donut. &quot;And how old are you? We&apos;ve got a lot of young ones on this team now.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Twenty-eight. I graduated last year with a Mechanical degree, but I haven&apos;t found much of anywhere to work until now,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;A year older than I am. </p><p>&emsp;The executive cuts in. &quot;I can assure you that he&apos;s the best. You know his father, John: he used to work in Aerospace until he moved up.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;So the legacy continues,&quot; Navesh says. &quot;I remember your father!

Let my work speak for me,&quot; he insists, walking around the table to join me in the back. </p><p>&emsp;Navesh squeezes words out under the executive&apos;s hopeful gaze: &quot;Well, we certainly have fresh energy with all these young people here.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Reed extends his hand, and I shake it. &quot;Nice to meet you, bro,&quot; Reed says, and despite the added tension, I find myself relieved to make another possible friend. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody Dunsmore,&quot; I say. I&apos;d compliment his firm handshake if it didn&apos;t make me feel like I was becoming my father. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;m Kei. Kei Sakurajima.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She extends her hand as the others rise to introduce themselves like it&apos;s the start of a church service. The executive lifts himself from leaning against the door frame. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then I guess I&apos;ll leave y&apos;all to it,&quot; he says. </p><p>&emsp;As the others swarm our unexpected colleague, I try to remember my own first day here, but it was really like any other. It was five hours before IT could get my email working, and although Navesh was warm with his welcome, nobody stood from their cubes to do so much as introduce themselves. I had to bring my own &apos;new guy donuts&apos; the next day to get the rest of the bean-counters and nerds to acknowledge my presence! </p><p>&emsp;We leave the room as soon as everyone gets their introduction. Nav looks like he wants to say something to me again about my timeliness, but is intercepted by Scott, and as we walk back, Reed takes a particular interest in Kei and I. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Designated seating, I was told,&quot; Reed says. He looks at the new edict from HR, a paper map atop his Bankers box of stuff. &quot;Says I&apos;m right next to you, Kei. Hope you&apos;re patient enough for all my questions.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I curse the corporate gods of fate that put me in the empty row with Wilbur. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;That shouldn&apos;t be a problem,&quot; Kei replies. &quot;Cody&apos;s bothered me since day one, and he&apos;s still doing it.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;How long have you both been here?&quot; Reed asks. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Three years and some change,&quot; Kei says. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Are you also new?&quot; Reed asks me. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. I&apos;ve been here for two years,&quot;I tell him. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh.&quot; His eyes turn from my box on the map, which still reads SUPPORT ENGINEER, and I know I&apos;ve been asking the same question. </p><p>&emsp;I feel a finger tap my shoulder after the others pass us. &quot;Can I talk to you for a second?&quot; Nav says. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh, yeah, sure,&quot; I tell him. My stomach drops further, realizing I have no idea if there&apos;s a bottom. We walk a couple steps to the row with vacant cubes. </p><p>&emsp;I try to take the fire from him by calling myself out first, stumbling over the first words that come to me. &quot;I&apos;m sorry I barely made it on time. Moving shouldn&apos;t be an excuse, and&mdash;&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I get it,&quot; he says. &quot;But if you were any later, that would have been a reflection on me in front of my boss, and the kind of things that I allow here. I&apos;m not safe here either. But, look. I don&apos;t know if you&apos;re just burned-out or something: you&apos;ve been on the threshold of the next level for ages, and I get you&apos;re feeling restless, but . . .&quot; He pauses because the next words are uncomfortable. &quot;If I&apos;m forced to make a list, I want you to be ready.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I mean that you&apos;re going to be near the bottom,&quot; he says, and then clarifies, &quot;by rank.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Me and the newer . . . guy?&quot; I ask, hushing my voice so no one can overhear me. Asking about seniority is totally my right, but I&apos;m too damn nervous to bring it up. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;You are, roughly.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;The rising feeling makes me ball my fists behind my back. </p><p>&emsp;I guess I only matter if I fucking know someone, I think. </p><p>&emsp;I hold back the strain in my eyes, and I find myself thinking that if my dream wasn&apos;t to work in that new building a little higher in the valley, and if the fears of that mortgage weren&apos;t so punishing, I&apos;d be actively out looking for something else. </p><p>&emsp;Looking out the window at that building calms me down just enough to pedal a false face of humility. &quot;I understand. I haven&apos;t been that great,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, I like you, Cody,&quot; he reassures me, but I don&apos;t feel it. &quot;I don&apos;t pull the strings or drive the gears. I&apos;m just a pinion between the executives and my team.&quot; An idler gear, only transferring the force it&apos;s given by the others. </p><p>&emsp;It takes a couple breaths before I can bring myself to respond. &quot;I&apos;ll do better, then, whether it means something or not,&quot; I tell him. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, with all this idle time we&apos;re gonna have, we&apos;ll have a couple projects to improve stuff. Make stuff the customers don&apos;t know they want yet. For me, it was redesigning the battery enclosure that made me prove myself enough to move up. So maybe . . .&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s a chance, you&apos;re saying.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;But not a promise.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I know that shit already, Nav, I think to myself, as I feel the whole path to my future rearranging itself in front of me. It takes all the strength I have to refuse to show it in my expression. </p><p>&emsp;A breath. And then another. </p>&quot;I appreciate you telling me this,&quot; I manage, enough to get him to go away. As the first tear crests my eye, trying to suck it back into my tear duct, I take a deep breath and decide to take my break early."},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"80","GivenName":"Anxiety and Avoidance","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"212","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Eleven","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Twelve","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":11,"ChapterFull":12,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"This chapter marks the end of chapters with extensive self-revision.

It only took a couple days before I realized that sitting on the job was a bad image, unless you have a lunch pail in your hands. Just like any routine &mdash; whether it&apos;s a new cycle of combat training, classes, or a new job &mdash; the first three days are memorable because it&apos;s all so fresh. I thought taking different quests would make each day distinct from the last, but from the fourth day onward, it all became a blur of motion, forgotten at the end of each day by an exaspirated body and a tired mind.</p><p>&emsp;This is the first job on city watch that has me raking leaves on the side. Though the mountainside is still flushed with fading green, the eager leaves transform from yellow to red and deposit themselves early on the stone thoroughfares. From a raised vantage point at the southwestern hillside of Gaffesend, I abate the stress by drawing in the crisp mountain air, watching as the browning wild lashes of the southern grasslands are battered about by gale winds.</p><p>&emsp;Long in the distance, the grand lake reflects the shadowed mountain view, too far to make the crests of little waves. I watch as junior guards paddle back from their postings on the outer rim, wondering which of my friends are among them. But it&apos;s nice to know that at least I&apos;m not alone.I&apos;ve gotten to know her a lot better: the shy pair well with the timid since they end up taking similar tasks. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;When should we head down?&quot; Naya asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well there&apos;s certainly no shortage of leaves, the Verdalan Gods make sure of it. Maybe now, I guess,&quot; I tell her. &quot;This was all supposed to be done before the royals came to town, as if miles of road could be effectively polished by five junior guards.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What does such a task even have to do with protecting?&quot; Naya mutters.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re protecting . . . the . . . image, I guess, of the city. And next we&apos;ll be protecting the parade route.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sometimes it feels like they&apos;re just trying to keep us busy with silly tasks,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s allowed me to get to know the locals really well, at least. They say they&apos;re glad we take the tasks that make a difference.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s because you fawn for social interaction, it&apos;s quite marvelous to me how you&apos;re so full of energy all the time. But that&apos;s coming from someone who doesn&apos;t make friends unless they see them every day for about a month.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A month?&quot; The math surprises me. But it sounds about right when I count all the days I&apos;ve taken off. I walk with Oriya, Jullian, Berry, and Ryder every morning for five of them, to take new postings from the quest board and get to work. Every sixth or so, I persuade them to join me on a hike or go swimming in the hot springs. And every night is my chance to get out and socialize when I&apos;m not taking night quests: having only scouted twice, I feel quite distant from the others.</p><p>&emsp;The loneliness carries into other areas, too. I&apos;ve only seen Jullian five times since the start of this transition. Besides walking to work hand-in-hand, we&apos;ve gotten together almost every day off to blow off some steam. I&apos;ve only been able to convince him once to go on a date with me to the hot springs, and it was on my earnings. The other times he says he&apos;s too busy &mdash; though I always see him with his friends. It disappoints me when our acts of passion end as soon as he gets off: the only courtesy he seems to have is letting me get there first.</p><p>&emsp;We descend the hill as the northern scouts congregate in Gaffesend Square. The bell tolls midday: normally that would mean a break for rations, but our service is expected to run later, and nobody minds when it makes this a &quot;two-quest-day.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I bet Bertram rues being sick when quest forms are this easy,&quot; I tell Naya. The slowness of this life almost makes me believe that Gaffe is as insular as the capital, capable of holding small events for royalty passing through the town. We&apos;re ordered to line up on the sides of the Main Street. It feels like a festival, the way all the street lamps are adorned with fresh flowers; the businesses shuttered for an hour; and the full population split between halves of the street. We stand in pattern between the onlookers and the empty road. The senior guards are busy on the city outskirts, demanding papers, and ensuring no Chymaeran spies are guising unwitting villagers. We hold the ceremonial rifles that we retrieved from the armory, clasped between our hands and upright, though Aldrin insists we &quot;can&apos;t be fully trusted with them yet,&quot; and that we need to &quot;train with a blade before we can handle them.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My eyes steady on the vacancy in front of me on the other side of the road, originally intended to be held by Bertram. Before long, the shimmering white carriage prattles down the road, drawn by two black horses. They&apos;re looking to have a two-nights&apos;-stay in the hot springs, and we&apos;re meant to prove to them that Gaffesend is safe, encouraging more tourists to make the trek to enrich our lands.</p><p>&emsp;I figure most of our population is excited for the presence of a Chosen Mask: we got the news that he was being paid to defend the carriage between villages. It&apos;s rare that anyone notable ever passes through, especially since we&apos;re the last stop before nothing. I can see him waving to his admirers from the coachman&apos;s seat as they cheer and throw flowers at the feet of the horses. Within the carriage, a finely-dressed family of six waves from the windows, wearing white and gold.</p><p>&emsp;I feel my hands loosen their tension on the rifle. The nagging feeling of fear that&apos;s plagued me since forever is almost in the back seat, and around me, I can drink to the exuberance of the town. To my left, Naya smiles, predictably not the type to cheer. To my right, Pax pumps his fist in the air. And Bertram is absolutely focused on the royals, standing there directly in front of me.</p><p>&emsp;The carriage is drawing closer, at least a hundred paces away. Some of the family&apos;s younger passengers have exited the carriage, walking alongside the road and tossing wrapped candies to the onlookers. The nagging feeling grows stronger. It&apos;s just too peaceful. And as my hands tension around the black steel, Bertram&apos;s eyes catch a glint of amethyst when he decides to make his move.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":33,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":11,"ChapterFull":12,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":33,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":47,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"First Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"45","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.12.33","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-32","Body":"<p>&emsp;They&apos;re close enough to run me over, but my body&apos;s trained to react before I can think. Muscle memory comes before thought, thought before fear, and fear before true reaction, so it&apos;s only when I&apos;m halfway across the road that the thoughts finally reach my muscles. The others are only beginning to notice when the Chymaeran fleshwalker raises the rifle. I&apos;m the only one that happened to know enough and be close enough to respond, and when I try to take another step, I feel the gravity of my past flood my veins with molasses.</p><p>&emsp;I struggle to refuse the defenses of my own mind. I always swear I can taste the smoke from that fire when my heartbeat rises. And as the Chymaeran assassin guising my friend prepares to take aim and pull the trigger, all I can do is watch as I collapse to the street, giving the horses such a start that they shy and snort, rearing on their hind legs, casting the carriage forwards and backwards.</p><p>&emsp;Pax is quick on the uptake: for every dearth of common sense, he excels in his perception, tuned to that energy of the attacker. While the other junior guards only begin to notice, and the Chosen is left helpless in a battle of speed, the assassin pulls the trigger, spooking the horses and the spectators as Pax tackles him to the ground.</p><p>&emsp;I brace my head with my cheek brushing moss between the roadway stones. The coachman pulls the slip knot, and the horses&apos; hooves clatter against the road, and I hold my breath, as if it could change the chances of the startled stallions shattering my spine or ribs. But they clamber right overhead, and as the carriage passes directly over my prostrated body lying straight with the road, I feel the wetness of something dense drip across my cheek.</p><p>&emsp;My ears still ring from the blast, but I can hear the cries of the children and the wife. And when I&apos;m sure my whole body can still respond to its commands, I begin to crawl from beneath the carriage.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;May the gods damn your pathetic town and its useless guards,&quot; the wife says. &quot;It should be wiped off the face of the map!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I begin to imagine the repercussions, and I try to prepare myself for what&apos;s to come. I accept my fate to vanish from this program. I had my chance, and yet I couldn&apos;t even finish the job!</p><p>&emsp;The Chosen drags me out from beneath the carriage with his gloved hands. A long streak of the husband&apos;s blood stains my bangs and trickles down my nose. When I look to the inside of the white carriage, emptied of its crying inhabitants and bright with a splatter of red, I find the husband taking shallow breaths as he holds his shoulder, tended to by the glowing hands of their family&apos;s hired healer.</p><p>&emsp;The immaculately-dressed wife&apos;s jewelry clatters when she gets her hands around my collar, thrashing me as the Chosen hesitates to disarm his source of wealth. Her hands are already red with her lover&apos;s blood, clothes absent the pristine ivory white they surely struggled to sustain on such sultry trails.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You cowering, yellow-bellied bitch,&quot; she exclaims. Her gloved hand batters my cheek with deafening leather contact. &quot;You leach our tribute. You live to give your lives for us, and I&apos;ll be sure you don&apos;t see another sunrise in this line of work. The guard of this backwater town are a joke!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I can feel my tears streaming, directly in the view of all my comrades that can only just stand there and watch. Jullian ducks his head when I meet his eyes. Naya freezes, her tail frayed. And Ryder and Pax are busy wrestling the Chymaeran as it tries to change forms. </p><p>&emsp;But I hear the husband. &quot;Dear. That young guard is the reason my head is on my shoulders. I mean, Gods, if she hadn&apos;t given the horses a start...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;She nearly got you killed!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The bullet did that,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But still,&quot; she says. The mercurial woman releases my collar and tensions her fists, letting out an exasperated cry. The side of my face aches as I slouch, wiping my tears with the unsullied parts of my arms, remembering not to dirty their carriage with contact from my body.</p><p>&emsp;But it&apos;s the distress of the children that damages me the most. Standing on the other side of their life-altering trauma, facing such failure that I&apos;m painted with the aggressor, the devastating shock registers on their faces, now devoid of sorrow, just speechless like I once was as they try to recalibrate their understanding of how horrifying the world can be. And all I want is to embrace them, to tell them that everything will be alright, to let them cry into my shoulder.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You failed us. And you&apos;re going to pay for this,&quot; the wife screams at Aldrin when he approaches. &quot;How are you going to make this right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;ll make it right by apologizing to my officer,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t care how much money you have, what role you play in the Empire, you will apologize for assaulting the woman who tried to save you!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And failed,&quot; she insists. &quot;You&apos;re messing with Valensend blood&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You gave two days of warning for your arrival, refusing like all you rich types do to pay in advance, and then you have the gall to say we didn&apos;t prepare. It takes weeks!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The woman tensions her fists. Two of children grasp her dress by the fabric. I draw deep breaths to make the blood flow back into my fingers and legs, all the while feeling like I&apos;m stealing a resource I no longer deserve.</p><p>&emsp;But I hear the father&apos;s voice behind me. &quot;She would have complained the same if it was just a scare: I would have stopped her if I had the strength. As far as I&apos;m concerned, you saved my life.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But I hesitated. I saved no one. It was luck.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Luck or not, you&apos;re a reason my children still have a father,&quot; he says. I turn around. He gestures for the servant and the healer to tend to my scratches, and with a quick wave of a hand, I feel the sting slowly dissipate from my face.</p><p>&emsp;He reaches from the open door, dabbing his blood from my skin with a clean corner of a towel, ensuring that nothing ill will come of this. Behind us, the two continue to argue as senior guards apprehend the battered Chymaeran assassin. It&apos;s only when I see the assailant&apos;s guise of my cherished friend that I remember the absence of the real one.</p><p>&emsp;I release an unintelligible string of words before the panic peaks inside me once again. Aldrin shouts. Two of my friends try to stop me, and the woman screams of my cowardice, but all I can think of is what I learned it takes for a Chymaeran to steal a guise.</p><p>&emsp;I run as fast as my feet will take me, choosing to try and save another, even if it means damnation for leaving this all behind.</p>"},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"75","GivenName":"Ennui and Excoriation","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Twelve","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Thirteen","ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":12,"ChapterFull":13,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":48,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"Revised Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"46","Synopsis":"Cody tries to evade his deepening depression.","Summary":"> Nav introduces project.

I&apos;ve spent so many hours between renders imagining how I would boost the performance if IT gave me a blank check and I was then the bottleneck &mdash; although a workstation laptop is nice to take home, it has nothing over one of those stationary rigs that the Robinson-Monroe lifers were grandfathered into.</p><p>&emsp;They gave me the laptop two years ago, and it hasn&apos;t been updated since. One day I booted into BIOS to see if I could overclock it, or take it to its limits. But IT&apos;s Great Wall of Control knows no bounds, so all I can do is sit here for twenty minutes at a time before I notice the changes in the drawing are applied.</p><p>&emsp;Those twenty minutes are silent. Only Wilbur and I sit in the row, and we&apos;re not even across from each other. Reed filled in the spot that the last escapee left behind, and although I was eager for months to move next to Kei and take the next steps, Navesh insisted it was a &quot;major waste of time.&quot; I feel like Wilbur and I have exhausted every topic across the generational gap: his kids, when I plan to marry, if I have a serious girlfriend yet, cars, and sports. Every day I hear his wake apnea over the partitions, and sometimes I wonder if it&apos;s the perfect cover for him to be sleeping.</p><p>&emsp;The computer still holds an hourglass. It&apos;s midday, and the neighboring row is filled with chatter. I hear Reed&apos;s voice the most often, and a little too often: if golden retrievers could design and code, and the connotation didn&apos;t imply he was stupid, I think it would fit him well. Kei acknowledges his musings here and there, but is always so focused that she spits no more than a couple words.</p><p>&emsp;I check the calendar in the lower right corner of my screen. Fall is fast approaching, and when I count, it&apos;s been almost four weeks since I moved in. Four weekends of my parents coming over to visit, bringing over one of my favorite home-cooked meals, allowing them to ask when they&apos;ll have grandkids now that I have a house. Four weeks since I lost my brother&apos;s classic IPod, so now I listen to music on my phone. But also four weeks without drinking: most days I just go home, spend an hour on the computer scrolling my list of games, trying to convince myself to play something, and then go to sleep early unless I go to the gym with Miguel.</p><p>&emsp;Reed keeps rambling on about sports and hobbies, and the more I just sit there &mdash; helpless to walk over or else I&apos;ll look lonely and desperate &mdash; the more I wonder if I&apos;m getting the right dose of meds. The longer time drags, and the later into my twenties it gets, the further I feel from the spurious passion of those college years where it was forced out of me. It&apos;s like being at the bottom of a dark pool, or a distant game of telephone recalling how I last recalled those moments. My vocal cords feel neglected for how little use they get, and like an unmotivated violinist, I&apos;ve been unpracticed for a while.</p><p>&emsp;The render loads. It breaks the entire assembly, and I have another three keystrokes before I wait even longer.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey, Reed. Good job on the redline today,&quot; Nav says. &quot;I hope you&apos;ve been getting used to the software?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; he says. &quot;Kei has been teaching me well. And Cody over there, too.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I count the green-stamped pages on my desk. Three I&apos;ve completed today. Maybe they just forget I work here?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So anyways. I want the three junior engineers to follow me,&quot; Nav says. I duck my head to look busy when he comes over. &quot;Cody, can you follow us?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure, Nav,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;We gather in one of the small meeting rooms. I sit first near the door, then Kei and Reed sit together on the far side. Nav makes small talk when he&apos;s plugging in his laptop. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen you at any of the happy hours, Cody,&quot; he says. &quot;The whole team was there last week: what have you been so busy with?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I even got Kei to go once,&quot; Reed says. &quot;And she&apos;s usually busy all the time!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Kei smiles. &quot;Yeah, I guess I can admit last week was a little fun. Even if it&apos;s just talking about guy stuff at a sports bar.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Reed looks at me earnestly. I can tell that he means it. &quot;You should come.&quot; He reminds me of my business major roommates in college, except before I had a legitimate excuse.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Sounds like fun.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, tonight&apos;s the night. We were thinking Chili&apos;s,&quot; Nav says. &quot;And you all have been doing great, so I thought I&apos;d buy you all a drink.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cheers to that!&quot; Reed exclaims, raising an imaginary glass as I take a long draw of an energy drink. Nav flicks on the projector. His screen comes into focus, with a presentation labeled INTERMITTENT APPRENTICE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, BY NAVESH D. PRATEL.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So I&apos;ve been looking for ways to keep us busy. Things have been rather slow, and with Scott leaving and all &mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Scott&apos;s leaving?&quot; We say in near unison.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Oh, shoot &mdash; I was supposed to wait until Monday, gosh darn it,&quot; he says. &quot;Keep this between us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And what&apos;s going to happen?&quot; Kei asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know, with the hiring freeze and all, maybe something will come from within,&quot; Nav says. He winks so hard I think I hear it. &quot;Anyways, on an unrelated note, I have a project to keep you guys busy, instead of vanishing early to go to Starbucks.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Awesome,&quot; Reed says, but literally.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We spend forever just designing and redesigning what already exists. It&apos;s what most of engineering is if you&apos;re not R and D, after all.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Next slide.</p><p>&emsp;A 90&apos;s clip-art image of batteries is on the screen, each with little faces, shaking hands like little powered businessmen. I nearly laugh and I have to cover my mouth.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You spend so much time doing redlines as support engineers that you don&apos;t get to feel what it&apos;s like to come up with something. Surely you felt it in college. Maybe you&apos;ve missed it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I nod almost as excitedly as Reed does.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Enclosures, and more enclosures. Modifying dimensions of existing batteries by the smallest hair to please a customer&apos;s plans. Well, I want you all to take a shot at designing something entirely new,&quot; Nav says. &quot;You should know how batteries work from experience, not just designing the stuff they&apos;re housed in.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yes, a million times yes,&quot; Reed says, and even Kei looks slightly invested.</p><p>&emsp;The next slide is a cross-section of a battery scanned from one of the lifers&apos; textbooks, with such hand-drawn beauty there&apos;s no doubt it came from the seventies. I relish that it&apos;s finally something I&apos;m good at, involving all the robotics I love to do in my garage.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What happens is a redox reaction, or reduction-oxidation,&quot; Nav says, sounding like my Circuits professor if he was twenty years older. &quot;The anode has electron-rich elements like zinc, so it&apos;s negative. The cathode has elements like silver, so it&apos;s positive, and when you connect a wire from one to the other, you get electron flow.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Next slide.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We typically do nickel-cadmium or lithium-ion, far better than the lead-acid ones. Then there&apos;s nickel-metal-hydride . . .&quot; </p><p>&emsp;He drones on and on. With the energy drink death-gripped in my hand, I manage to stay awake: Reed can do it without anything. I decide to just wait for the email with the PowerPoint.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And, with all these considerations, your task will be to design an optimal battery, given a set volume. You&apos;ll do some theory, then we&apos;ll use the multimillion-dollar battery lab the R&D guys seem to have forgotten about.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s great,&quot; Reed says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How far you go with this project is up to you, and what you take from it is very important. You&apos;ll be doing this between redlines, getting feedback from Senior engineers, so that you design the best battery possible, and safely,&quot; he says, closing his laptop. &quot;We&apos;ll be starting next week. And since it&apos;s Friday, maybe we can talk about it at Happy Hour.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We all stand from the table. My foot falls asleep pretzeled on my other leg, so I stumble towards the door last. But before I can exit, Reed stops me.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":35,"ActNum":2,"ChapterPart":12,"ChapterFull":13,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":35,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":50,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"First Draft","Keywords":"Paragate, Cody","UUID":"48","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"2.13.35","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-34","Body":"<p>&emsp;&quot;Hey bro.

I draw a couple concepts for the enclosure on sheets of TOPS engineering paper, an empty pad from never designing anything new. The late hour comes, and when the others begin to make their egress, it&apos;s just Kei and I.</p><p>&emsp;After shutting down. I pass her while she&apos;s deep in a design project. I&apos;m surprised she notices.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Quite the eager guy, isn&apos;t he,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Who, Reed?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot; She laughs. &quot;Reminds me of you when you started here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, you mean before my soul got sucked from my body?&quot; I approach her, pulling down my eyelids and rolling my eyes to expose the bloodshot whites. &quot;Can you see it in there? Is it still alive?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She draws close to take a glance, and I catch a smell of familiar perfume from a date long forgotten. &quot;Just enough, I think.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I say, &quot;I don&apos;t have energy like he does. That&apos;s for sure. And . . . it&apos;s lonely over there. Wilbur just snores all day, unless he&apos;s bashing his keyboard and cursing at the new software.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, then maybe I could make up for it,&quot; she says. But she&apos;s still focused on her drawing.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I mean we could hang out sometime. Like, outside of work,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;My mind struggles to think of something platonic. &quot;Oh. Like what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know. The kind of stuff we used to do. But before, before...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Before that last summer before you left, I think. That was just Student Government stuff late in the evenings. Late work like this. I remember the last day of my junior year and her senior year, cleaning the room one last time as the Presidential cabinet, when I felt my heart swell in my chest with the apprehension of whether I was going to make my move. Time was running out. I had waited all year. The door was closed, and when she turned around, I pressed my lips to hers, and she dissolved into me, starting that perfect summer before she went&mdash;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody? I said we could do dinner.&quot; I was staring at her lips the whole time. It&apos;s a miracle I didn&apos;t raise half a chub, thanks to the waistband trick.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, that sounds great. I&apos;ve got a couple Chuck E Cheese coupons I&apos;ve been clipping out of the gazette.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What the fuck?&quot; She laughs, something I haven&apos;t heard in a while. &quot;See, this is the part of you I miss. There&apos;s surely still a soul in there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I hope so,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll shoot you a text,&quot; she offers, just as Reed sends another message in our group chat. All I can think of is how we left it last: letting the chance of starting anew decay over four years of college. It never had a title, but the split was worse than any other relationship I&apos;ve been in.</p><p>&emsp;My mind is abuzz on the car ride home, so distracted the dark dissolves my sight of the exit gate, and I nearly ram it. I should be happy, but I feel some kind of sadness overtake me, and by the third light, I can feel my eyes well with tears. Maybe it&apos;s how fast the four weeks since moving in have gone.

I decide ahead of time to break in instead of patiently knocking, hoping the others piece together my purpose for panic instead of thinking I&apos;m just deserting. My two friends are built like bricks, but it&apos;s all the muscle that helps in a sprint. If Bertram&apos;s house were any further than three blocks, they might have fallen behind. My legs are long and my conditioning is great, but it&apos;s not enough. I feel one of them lift me into the air as I continue to struggle, like a rabbit caught in an eagle&apos;s clutches.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Let me go! He&apos;s not out sick, he&apos;s dying,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know,&quot; Ryder says. &quot;I checked the Chymaeran&apos;s things. He didn&apos;t have a Guise Marker on him, so he didn&apos;t have the time to sever a finger. You know it takes a while to process.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It wasn&apos;t meant to be a permanent guise. It was just for a moment, so it&apos;s off blood. That means Bertram has to be alive to keep it going,&quot; Pax says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re not doing this alone,&quot; says Ryder, finally putting me down. &quot;We&apos;re going to help him together.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Fine. But the guise isn&apos;t active anymore,&quot; I tell them, as we begin to run at even pace. &quot;He has no need to be alive.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We pass the market street, then sprint along the road at the edge of the lake. I collect speed with distance, and by the time we arrive at Bertram&apos;s gate, I leverage all my Essence and anger against his door, bashing my armored shoulder against the painted wood.</p><p>&emsp;The door splits in splintered halves. The dust and sawdust coalesce in dark, floating motes as the sun casts ribbons of light through the entryway, and I squint my eyes to adjust to the darkness of his house. There is not a sound to tell his whereabouts. We enter the kitchen to find the window ajar with the curtains fluttering, the same window I use to trade for breakfast.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He&apos;s not on the bottom floor,&quot; I say. It&apos;s just a single, long room that mixes the kitchen with a living space and dining area. None of the chairs are overturned, and the mess looks average for a single man.</p><p>&emsp;We begin to climb the stairs. Pax insists on going first, followed by Ryder, followed by me, with my dagger drawn hilt-up. They know the hallway design is two rooms and a master, so they split off to take the other rooms, leaving me with the only place my friend can feasibly lie.</p><p>&emsp;We throw the doors open at the same time. I hear no commotion from the other two, and as I approach the bed, I see the sheets are clean, crumpled with a pallid figure sweating in short trousers.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Bertram,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;He&apos;s breathing heavily, still unable to move, and veins of amethyst metastasize in a rash across his skin.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Clear,&quot; the others report, entering the bedroom to find me kneeling beside his bed.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How bad is it? Do you know?&quot; I ask Pax. &quot;He&apos;s breathing, and he&apos;s not bleeding, what did they do to him?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Pax presses his fingers to Bertram&apos;s neck. The room gets colder as his fingertips flush with obsidian. &quot;The guise is up, so he&apos;s not being drained any longer, but he&apos;a really on the edge.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Drained?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The blood,&quot; Pax says. &quot;For a short guise like this that doesn&apos;t take a pound of flesh, it evaporates from his body every minute, damaging his organs. He&apos;ll wish he lost a finger instead.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We need to heal him right away,&quot; I say, extending my hands, but Pax stops me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Human Essence will only make this worse. It&apos;s like treating frostburn with warm water.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then what do we do?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;There&apos;s medicine at the base, but it&apos;s really up to him until we can get him there. He&apos;s got to fight,&quot; Pax says. &quot;The worst is over, but I only know l as far as experimenting with my Chymaeran blood has gotten me. I&apos;ll still monitor the Curse.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;ll carry him,&quot; Ryder says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We need to keep him warm,&quot; I say. He&apos;s sweating so profusely, but I tuck the sheets around him, feeling his flesh is colder than ice. I press my head to his chest, listening to his faint heartbeat. &quot;It&apos;s my turn to save you,&quot; I tell him, standing back as Ryder works to position him across the back of his shoulders.</p>Beyond his window, the curious villagers and guards begin to gather, and I pray that Aldrin will have the understanding.

He steps carefully between villagers seated on the floor.&quot;Gods above,&quot; another says.I find Aldrin standing at the front of the room: his natural height is enough to demand attention. &quot;This only proves further that today was far from a failure. I know you are all scared of repercussions, of tribute lost, but it doesn&apos;t change the fact that Gaffesend is vital to the defense of our homeland.&quot;Since I&apos;m able to catch my breath for the first time, I walk around the back of the room to stand beside Jullian, but he doesn&apos;t turn to me, focused on the words of our leader.&quot;I know it wasn&apos;t perfect. They&apos;re still learning, but they took action, and I want to recognize the bravery of Pax and Katiya, and their quick reactions to the evil vice of our enemy.&quot;He raises his hands to try and start a cheer, but the room is quiet.&quot;We don&apos;t care about bravery, we care about safety. How can we be sure our village is really safe?&quot; Someone says. The other villagers agree.&quot;This was an act to incite fear, to make it feel like a losing battle,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;It was an act of attacking the mind of a people, not an act of definite power!&quot;&quot;But what if it was?&quot; One of the farmers says. &quot;I stare into the darkness every night in the southeast, how can I be sure of that?&quot;&quot;We need more than just the professional guards, more than the army, we need everything you have!&quot;&quot;Then we will do something about it.&quot;&quot;Do what?

The numbness returns to my fingers.&quot;Night missions. Indefinite night scouting missions, and during the day, too,&quot; Aldrin offers, the first thing that seems to quell the fears across the town hall. &quot;No more idle quests, we&apos;ll place them at the threshold.&quot;The cheer grows louder. My heart beats faster.&quot;We will do everything in our power to keep this town safe. And we&apos;ll re-institute the volunteer force if needed. I promise you,&quot; he says, and when I reach for a space behind Jullian to sit, the others stand.Before long, the townies are leaving, satisfied enough with the answer. I reach for Jullian&apos;s hand, but he&apos;s gone without a word, and I feel like I deserve it.I can feel the static on my flesh. When I&apos;m far enough behind my friends, I stumble home, feeling the weakness begin to overtake me. My curling fingers fumble for the key. My name will be scratched off it soon. I&apos;m too humiliated to ask for Jullian&apos;s comfort when he never stays in the first place, my other friend is fighting for his life, and it feels like the only option I have is to invoke the help of the stranger I shut out so many weeks ago.I press desperately against the shelf as my body curls on itself, praying that the passageway is still there and I won&apos;t crumple in the closet. I crack the door, struggling to drive it against the bookshelf since I didn&apos;t push it far enough, trying to slide my body only to find a second door firmly locked in place.I remember the strange name of the foreign language I can somehow understand, and I cry it like an incantation. &quot;Cody. Help me, please,&quot; I beg, pounding on the door. &quot;Cody!&quot;The door latches. I hear a shrill, ear-piercing screech sound from beneath my foot as something finesses heavy piece of metal bracing the door. His hand rips the screeching thing to pieces before he manages to leverage it open, killing the metallic creature mid-cry.When the door opens, all I can manage is to collapse into his arms, and he embraces me, leading me into his foyer as the tears run from my eyes.His voice is soothing as he tries to calm me. It&apos;s the only sense I have when my eyes are shut, trying to abate the fear of all the artifacts around me. I can feel my back settle into the comfortable couch where I found his friend sleeping, and he sits beside me, placing his arm around me at enough of a distance to prevent me from thinking that he&apos;s trying to make a move.&quot;So, uh, what happened?&quot;"},{"DocType":"Act","GivenName":"","AutoNamePart":"","AutoNameFull":"ACT III","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":"","ChapterFull":"","IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":55,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"53","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3","Perspective":"Default","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"Act Two: Summer","Body":""},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"60","GivenName":"The Sleeping Knight","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;One","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Fifteen","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":1,"ChapterFull":15,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":56,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"First Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"53","Synopsis":"Breakfast tacos relieve panic attacks.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.15","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"05/22/26","FantasyTime":"2A-128, 81st of Suntide","StoryDay":"Friday","Setting":"Hearthland Ridge Estates"},"DocName":"14 // &quot;The Sleeping Knight&quot;","Body":""},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":1,"AutoNameFull":39,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":1,"ChapterFull":15,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":1,"SceneFull":39,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":57,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"Paragate, Cody","UUID":"54","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Katiya crosses over in a panic attack.

She speaks in strings of syllables I can&apos;t comprehend, but it&apos;s not her desperate cries that confuse me the most.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s the fact that the last four weeks passed so peacefully. I thought this was all just a dream after that drunken night with Miguel, but the beautiful girl I mistook for a cosplayer chokes on her tears between breaths as she buries her face into my arm.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;They&apos;ve all abandoned me,&quot; she says. &quot;I failed to . . . he almost died, because . . .&quot; My fingers trace her back until I realize I&apos;m just touching her armor (and it&apos;s doing nothing for her). I gently guide her back against the couch. For every extra breath of air she finds, she shells it out in useless ramblings that drive her further into a panic, tensioning her body inwards as the tears flow from her face.</p><p>&emsp;She tensions her hands  around my arm so strongly that the blood starts seizing in my own limb. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Save your breath,&quot; I tell her. &quot;You have to breathe. Whatever happened has passed, and it&apos;s over now. You&apos;re safe here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But the town&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The town is fine,&quot; I tell her, uncertain of what delusion could cause such a visceral reaction. It was all a fever dream, right? I remember getting sliced across the palm, but I woke up without a scratch. The girl&apos;s my neighbor: just a whacked-out cosplayer. Maybe someone reported her stream to the IRS for tax evasion?</p><p>&emsp;She finds more words as her trembling subsides. &quot;I only came here because . . . I had no other choice, and as much as I wish I never had to see you again . . .&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Excuse me?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I mean . . . as much as I know we hate each other, after&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash; I don&apos;t hate you,&quot; I tell her. But then the semantics of that lucid dream come back to me. The cut in my palm. The kitchen knives she threw at my head. &quot;Not that much, I mean.&quot; And then I remember the gash she sliced in my championship lacrosse stick that got me from freshman benchwarmer to Varsity senior. &quot;I&apos;m just afraid of you. And&mdash;and you piss me off a little, but not that much,&quot; I say, trying to balance the resurgent feelings of vice with a desire for goodwill.</p><p>&emsp;Her stress slides further from panic into sorrow, exchanging less heaving breaths for more tears. She&apos;s dressed entirely in her custom light armor: I&apos;d think she&apos;d only need it above the torso to film a Let&apos;s Play in character, but she&apos;s committed to the part.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey. Let&apos;s get that armor off of you,&quot; I tell her. She reaches for the faux-leather straps on the sides, and when I grab the shoulder pads, I find them oddly cold to the touch.</p><p>&emsp;I try lifting as she lifts her arms, but it&apos;s pretty heavy for light armor. The fabric feels hand-woven, with the smallest imperfections that tell of old-world craftsmanship. It smells of sweat and manual labor. And as I struggle to pull it off her body, I notice the contours of the breastplate are caught on something beneath.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Ow,&quot; she sniffles. &quot;Let me loosen the straps more.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You got this made of actual metal? Cast iron?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What else would stop an arrow?&quot; She asks, holding her breath as I tug harder. Once she finds enough breath to go without it, she exhales completely, and in an instant, I lose my balance and trip over one of the unpacked boxes from four weeks ago.</p><p>&emsp;The entire weight of the armored torso lands on my face when I crash to the floor. My hands cup the meager metal chest contours of modified men&apos;s armor, weighing against my face and smelling of sweat as if I were stuck in a scrum of lacrosse players.</p><p>&emsp;But I can hear her breathe easier without the burden of all that cosplay gear. Her breathless panic makes even more sense when I rid my face of the breastplate, discovering how much she has to contort herself just to fit into the damn thing.</p><p>&emsp;She removes the last of her bindings, far tighter than the &quot;combat corset&quot; that constrains her waist. She pulls at the fabric of the undershirt to circulate air, where two large sweat spots accentuate the shape of her chest.</p><p>&emsp;Her face and golden eyes alone could get a zoomer to watch her stream Excel spreadsheets: if she ditched the immersive armor and went for something less practical, she could be living in a mansion!</p><p>&emsp;I open my mouth to try to distill that compliment into something platonic, but stop when I see the state of her. Her disheveled hair is frayed far past the braid I first saw her with. Crescents dig beneath her eyes, and as she still works at slowing her breaths &mdash; muttering to herself something about &quot;where she is&quot; &mdash; I can see how tired this whole ordeal has made her, and my feelings of malice slip away.</p><p>&emsp;She sits with her head in her hands, tensioning her fingers around her scalp. I&apos;d offer her a hug if I didn&apos;t think she still hated me, so instead, I decide to warm her with something else.</p><p>&emsp;I approach the kitchen, starting the coffee maker to make some hot chocolate my mom left from the old house. I watch her golden eyes peer over the edge of the couch when the heating element starts boiling the water, like my parents&apos; cat when the refrigerator makes ice.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s not Starbucks,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;She tilts her head. &quot;What is it doing?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Boiling water?&quot; I answer.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh.&quot; She leans higher, watching the flickering blue LED light with a genuine sense of bewilderment. &quot;So you do have Essence. Why didn&apos;t you use it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Essence?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Essence. To run the mechanism: top off the Essence capacitor. Like a stove, or a fan, or...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It runs on electricity.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Electricity?&quot; She asks. &quot;What a waste. How do you have that much power? And how rich are you to have all this,&quot; she gestures around the living room, &quot;stuff?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She still finds the strength to do her bit, despite whatever wore on her. &quot;I bought most of it at Home Goods and that corner part of Ross without the clothes. I&apos;m far from rich when I have a mortgage hanging over my head now,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You must make a lot of Kine off your inventions.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not yet. I get paid to modify other people&apos;s stuff,&quot; I tell her. My hands reach into the cabinet, finding the old matching mugs Kei and I bought for the Student Government club room. I hesitate over which one to grab, then after the coffee maker pings, I grab my own.</p><p>&emsp;The old coffee maker dispenses the succulent store-bought chocolate into the mug, rising with steam as dots of moisture condense on the blue inner walls of the porcelain. But it doesn&apos;t feel very warm.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. It&apos;s a drink,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;I look at her, puzzled, until she gestures to bring it over.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s an old coffee maker from my parents&apos; house. They got a new Keurig, so they let me have the old one &mdash; the model before it scanned the damn pods to make sure you&apos;re buying theirs. Heating element isn&apos;t great, so hopefully it&apos;s not like drinking chocolate milk.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not a problem,&quot; she says, taking the cup into her hands. I notice a faint glow emanate from beneath the cup as the air warms around her, and in seconds, the cup is steaming again.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s my turn for bewilderment. She catches my expression with a tired glance. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How did you...?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I bend to look beneath the mug, but there&apos;s nothing there. Once I realize it looks like I&apos;m staring directly at her breasts, I bend upright.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What kind of an uncultured bumpkin are you?&quot; She asks. &quot;Life and fire. Humans. You. Me,&quot; she says, raising her right hand to pretend she&apos;s bending fire.</p><p>&emsp;Pretending, right?</p><p>&emsp;I feel the heat first. And then at a point an inch above her palm, a spark transitions into a raging plume of controlled fire, casting the walls in flickering light.</p><p>&emsp;I instinctively reach to see if it&apos;s a hologram. I feel burning heat before she ceases, slapping my hand away.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You grab for fire like you grabbed for that dagger,&quot; she says. &quot;Pray tell, what kind of stupid idiot savant are you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I stammer over my words. My mind races through every physics and thermodynamics textbook I&apos;ve ever skimmed for problem sets, and can&apos;t find any explanation. The sudden wave of confusion is so strong that I sit down on the box I tripped on moments earlier. &quot;Sweet Carnot,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Is that one of your gods?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;If you design cars and airplanes,&quot; I say. &quot;What the fuck?&quot; And then I gesture to her. &quot;Do it again. How did you do that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m too damn tired, she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do it,&quot; I insist, like a child at a birthday magic show.</p><p>&emsp;She casts it again as she takes her first sip from the mug, careful to watch if I&apos;ll try and reach for it again, but I raise my hands.</p><p>&emsp;Her eyes light with delight. It seems like an emotion she hasn&apos;t felt in a long time.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is really good,&quot; she says. &quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hot chocolate. From the grocery store. But really, though. How did you&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She takes another loud sip. &quot;I usually hate sweet stuff. But this is nice.&quot; She warms it further with her hands: the mug glows with conductive heat, and then she drinks all the rest of it in a single swallow.</p><p>&emsp;Now I have my head in my hands, unsure whether I really want to know the secret behind her sleight-of-hand.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You really have never seen this before? Even a child can make a spark,&quot; she insists, reclining back into the couch as her eyes feather on the edge of exhausted sleep.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not a damn child,&quot; I tell her. &quot;It&apos;s not real. You can&apos;t just...&quot; but then I realize she&apos;s fading away on the couch: it must be comfortable if it makes Miguel fade away this easily, too.</p><p>&emsp;I take the mug by the handle and rinse it in the sink. The red-hot bottom evaporates the first volume of water to steam before it normalizes, and I flip it upside-down into the dish organizer, since I haven&apos;t run the dishwasher in a week and I can&apos;t remember if it&apos;s all dirty or not. On the bottom, I inspect the words I wrote almost a decade earlier.</p><p>&emsp;STU GOV KING + QUEEN</p><p>&emsp;2016</p><p>&emsp;She breathes so softly on the couch that I almost forget she&apos;s there. And when I approach, I find her deep in sleep: sweating again, muttering something about a cabin as her right hand searches for something.</p><p>&emsp;She mutters a name. </p><p>&emsp;I don&apos;t hear it. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Stay,&quot; she asks, as tears crest again in her eyes, and I sit on the box again, as her hand feels for something like fronds of a flower feeling for the sun, finding its way to mine.</p>And once it finds me, it refuses to let go."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":40,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":1,"ChapterFull":15,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":40,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":58,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"Paragate, Cody","UUID":"55","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Next morning, awkward breakfast.

The space smells like the industrial quarter of Northaven, and when I feel the sensation of feathers against my neck, I wonder if I squeezed another pillow so hard that the stuffing came out.</p><p>&emsp;But it&apos;s the hair of a man. Not my man. But a man that mumbles something with his face buried between my breasts as I tension him further.</p><p>&emsp;When I release him, he gasps, and I notice the spread of blankets on the floor. One of the couch&apos;s pillows is on the ground, and a scrounging of scavenged blankets makes a meager bed. His face is flushed with a mix of several dissimilar emotions he can&apos;t resolve, and mine flushes further when I realize what I&apos;ve done.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Y-you know how lucky you are that it&apos;s a Saturday?&quot; he says. &quot;I could barely reach for enough to make a bed to get a couple hours of sleep! Then pulling me in like that? And I don&apos;t even know your name,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Katiya Breakey-Hilde. And you&apos;re . . . Cody?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, wiping the sweat from my chest off both sides of his face. &quot;At least I had my phone with me. I ordered us something: you can pay me later.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I look at the laughable spread of blankets and bedsheets again, more concerned about the duress I put him under. &quot;You could have let go. I mean, you don&apos;t even know me. Why didn&apos;t you force my hand away and get a good night of sleep?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;His voice quiets on a hint of humiliation. &quot;Well, you know, you were crying and all. Said not to leave, again and again, and your grip is pretty strong, so...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So you didn&apos;t leave,&quot; I say. Something makes me want to tear up again when a strange sense of relief approaches, but I&apos;m done being weak and sentimental. &quot;Well, thank you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure. But you can do me a favor and take a shower?&quot; he asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Excuse me?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It smells like you haven&apos;t showered in a week,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I can&apos;t afford a shower,&quot; I tell him. &quot;I went in the lake last week, then took a bath, like, four days ago.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Really? You can afford to shower. It&apos;s not like the drought three years ago.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Can&apos;t afford A SHOWER,&quot; I clarify, gathering my things like a mistress of the night.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It comes with the damn unit!&quot; Cody exclaims. &quot;How could you possibly not have a shower? There were only two options in the builder&apos;s package. Either Mantequilla, or&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Wait,&quot; I say, putting my hand to his mouth. A shadow approaches the door of his house that&apos;s so immaculate and messy at the same time. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Probably just the delivery driver,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s not a knocker.&quot; I reach for the knife I kept hidden in the side holster of my breastplate, ready to pounce as soon as the adversary blasts open the door. Cody is too weak to defend himself.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yo, chill! Chill out. Look,&quot; he says, showing me a brightly-lit device with far more little colored squares than the music box. A cartoon of an automobile is on the screen, dancing around the center of a map. &quot;You don&apos;t have to stab first and ask questions later, soldier girl.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And you don&apos;t have to grab fire and blades, foolish boy,&quot; I respond.</p><p>&emsp;He cracks the door. I rise to my feet and find the footing to attack, but when the door opens, some bearded guy with earrings and fancy glasses hands a bag to him. Cody mutters some question about whether the tip of something is in an app, and then he nods, allowing him to close the door, and when I catch a glimpse of the scene beyond the door, I realize again that it looks nothing like Gaffesend.</p><p>&emsp;I rush to the window, throwing open the shades. &quot;Where is this? Where are you? And where&apos;s the lake?&quot; I ask. I begin to think it&apos;s all a ruse to trap me at my weakest.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A couple blocks down. You think I could afford lakeside in this economy?&quot; He asks. &quot;But the walk is nice.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Before he can hand me something from the bag, I race back across the threshold of my door, only to find my world the same way I left it. From my window, Gaffesend is abuzz with the week&apos;s end sight of commoners strolling on the cobblestone streets.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya,&quot; Cody calls. &quot;Do you want your tacos or not?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody,&quot; I say. &quot;This is...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He crosses the threshold of the door, finding the same sight he must have thought was just a dream. Now he rushes to my window, watching the water reflect in the light of an early-morning sun.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m glad he put the bag down in the other world. He clutches his chest, short of breath, and I think the man of science is finally beginning to understand that the world is not as measurable as he thinks.</p><p>&emsp;His face flushes white as if he&apos;s seen a Chymaeran fleshwalker. I have to catch him before he falls, and I grab him by the space between his arms.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You weren&apos;t &mdash; you mean that&mdash;&quot; Cody tries to struggle from my grasp to walk out my front door for the first time by his own volition, but his clothes are far too strange: they might think he&apos;s a Chymaeran spy, or ask his noble heritage.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Stop resisting,&quot; I command, hugging him to my chest. I realize I&apos;m speaking my own tongue now, and he&apos;s speaking mine, and I say, &quot;seriously, can you stop fighting me when I&apos;m trying to help you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do it again,&quot; he says, slumping in dead weight before he collects himself, rising to his feet half a head taller than me. &quot;Do the fire trick again.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I roll my eyes. &quot;It&apos;s not a trick, Cody.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Do it,&quot; he says, then adds, &quot;please,&quot; staring at me with his dark brown eyes.</p><p>&emsp;I light a simple flame. He looks on with such stupid, childlike captivation that I wonder what other dumb banality could capture his attention.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Holy shit,&quot; he says. &quot;And how do you do that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Watch this,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;I direct the energy to form a loop of flame, spinning around my palm. And some of the other stupid tricks the cadets used to come up with. &quot;So can we eat now?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess it will never get cold,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So you live your whole life without Essence?&quot; I ask him. &quot;So you&apos;re some kind of purist monk?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He responds in my tongue again without noticing he&apos;s doing it. &quot;No Essence at all. Just electricity: there&apos;s no magic in our world.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But what about the cars?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A four-stroke engine that runs on dead dinosaurs.&quot; I don&apos;t catch the meaning of the last word, but my mind associates it with creatures from an eternity ago. He clarifies. &quot;Gasoline. Hydrocarbons from crude oil.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s as if the world wasn&apos;t made for you. As if your world never had the blessings of the Gods.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We don&apos;t know if there is a god, beyond money and power,&quot; Cody says. &quot;They certainly haven&apos;t introduced themselves in person.&quot;</p>&quot;Well, let&apos;s eat,&quot; I insist. &quot;Before it gets cold, or before I have to warm it up again.&quot;"},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"45","GivenName":"Luddite By Chance","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Two","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Sixteen","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":2,"ChapterFull":16,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":59,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"First Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"56","Synopsis":"Cody gives Katiya a lazy day in Hearthland Ridge.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.16","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"05/23/26","FantasyTime":"2A-128, 82nd of Suntide","StoryDay":"Saturday","Setting":"Hearthland Ridge Estates"},"DocName":"15 // &quot;Luddite By Chance&quot;","Body":""},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":1,"AutoNameFull":41,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":2,"ChapterFull":16,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":1,"SceneFull":41,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":60,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"57","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Katiya gets a lazy day, gradually introduced to things.

I thought it was streaming, but if you&apos;re really a city guard, then that explains a lot.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Probational city guard,&quot; she clarifies, as if I should care.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cool.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But I think first &mdash; we should set some ground rules for sharing this space.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; I say. &quot;Leave it to the city guard to go rambling on about making laws.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But seriously,&quot; she says, beaming a look of sincerity through her actually-amber eyes. &quot;We have to set boundaries or else things could worsen.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess, but do we have to do that right now? Let&apos;s put it off. It&apos;s the weekend.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t do week&apos;s ends,&quot; she states, in a sinister voice that almost raises gooseflesh on my arms.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; I tell her, raising my hands, feeling like a complete couch potato. &quot;We&apos;ll go for a drive later, then. So: where&apos;s your quill and ink, so we can write up this document? Did you pluck the pheasant for a fresh tip?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We have pens, you nonce,&quot; Katiya says.</p><p>&emsp;I grab an old notebook from engineering school and flip it to an empty page near the back. I grab a pen from the ground, only to realize it&apos;s one of Miguel&apos;s disposable vape pens he forgot to pick up.</p><p>&emsp;Katiya laughs, muttering something.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What was that?&quot; I demand.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like a child,&quot; she says. &quot;With all your fancy science, your children don&apos;t learn to write without lines?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Piss off,&quot; I tell her. And then I add, &quot;Maybe if your world could come up with half this shit instead of relying on Essence, you&apos;d be able to buy a shower instead of using mine,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Maybe that&apos;s the first rule.&quot; I reach for an actual pen in one of the boxes. &quot;Don&apos;t ever get too comfortable with the other world&apos;s stuff, though that&apos;s probably more for you, right?&quot;</p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>01.

That I&apos;m safe. That I can&apos;t possibly get hurt, regardless of how fast we go. That anything foreign and strange and big and too impossibly smooth is there for a reason, and that nothing is going wrong unless he says it is, and that he&apos;ll surely bring it up if things are even slightly bad.</p><p>&emsp;He doesn&apos;t press the glowing switch on the wall for a reason, facing the large metal door that looks like it isn&apos;t supposed to open from the sides. The automobile is so smooth and metallic: shinier than my greatsword, and probably one of the shiny things he told me not to touch.</p><p>&emsp;But he instructs me to enter. Then he looks down at my feet and realizes I&apos;m wearing steel boots, and demands more of me, telling me to lace up a pair of his &quot;trainers&quot; though they look nothing like shoes of war.</p><p>&emsp;And once my feet fill the space like two parishioners in a grand chapel to the Gods, he tells me to GENTLY! pull the handle, afraid of my strength.</p><p>&emsp;I sit in the car on the comfortable seat, wondering why everything is so soft in this world that you could fall asleep on it: even the people, from the kind of food Cody&apos;s shown me so far. And then he presses a button on a wide mirror that opens the door to this car room: sounding off with a loud rumble of a generator that nearly sets me into panic.</p><p>&emsp;He reassures me that it&apos;s all okay. But then something flashes on his automobile&apos;s front thing about blue teeth being connected, and I hear the loudest sound I&apos;ve ever heard: one that gives me such a start that I notice it gives him a start, and according to his original rules, that means that I should panic.</p><p>&emsp;His hand slams against the circular knob as I almost drive my fist against the glowing screen, but he deflects my hand just in time. He wags his finger several times at me before pulling out his cellular telephone to change something, saying that music about metal is probably too much for me, that he was just at the gym.</p><p>&emsp;I ask him what they&apos;re yelling about. He says he doesn&apos;t really know, but that it gets him &quot;amped&quot; at the gymnasium, and chooses some other thing that tells the sonograph to play another tune.</p><p>&emsp;He backs out of the space slowly. His eyes flicker between my face and the edge of the car port that&apos;s close to the metal door, and I nearly slam my head against the front with the sudden change in inertia.</p><p>&emsp;He presses his left arm against my shoulders, telling me to relax. And when he&apos;s beginning to second-guess himself of this whole plan, saying that he&apos;s only &quot;adding fuel to the fire that is my anxiety,&quot; and that I&apos;m never going to relax at this rate.</p><p>&emsp;I tell him I&apos;m not made to relax, and that I&apos;ve faced worse than his soft world with all these rounded edges could ever throw at him.</p><p>&emsp;So we back out of the driveway. I tense my legs and feet against the bottom of the car to make sure my back is always against the soft chair, and when he makes his first full quarter-turn backwards into the street, something closes the big steel door.</p><p>&emsp;He asks if I&apos;m alright. I ask if he&apos;s going to stop asking if I&apos;m alright, and when my eyes look up from my legs to take in the view beyond the warped front glass, I see a marvel of architecture in front of my eyes.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s like the town of Gaffesend with all its row-houses, but cleaner and sharper. There are children here that play in the street: the young ones at least, the older ones sit in the corners on telephones like the one that Cody has, laughing at something as they share it with each other. One man sprays a dedicated stream of water from a hose to wet his plants. There are so many other cars that sit all across the road: behind the car garages, on the streets off to the side, so many that I wonder if they have cars this comfortable, why they would need a house in the first place. </p><p>&emsp;I wonder aloud. It makes Cody laugh pretty hard, and he manages to collect himself by the first red octagon with the words STOP written across it.</p><p>&emsp;I don&apos;t allow the inertia to surprise me this time. But the right turn does, and I lean so far into Cody that I have to stabilize myself by grabbing his right leg, causing him to slam the brake and throw himself forward.</p><p>&emsp;He barks at me, but without bite, gesturing to a handle attached to the top edge of the car, something he calls the &quot;oh-shit handle,&quot; insisting I grab it until I get my bearing. Several seconds later, he changes his mind and tells me not to, afraid I might rip it off the roof.</p><p>&emsp;But I&apos;m too amazed by the sights to tense my body for any turns. When the view of houses opens up after a couple turns, and the musical automobile climbs a slight hill, I catch a fuller view of the city: spanning so far that my eyes can&apos;t count the number of buildings. Not a single stretch of farmland is anywhere: just buildings erected from the colors of nature around them; shiny points of light that shimmer in the mountains; large balloons of color with people in them that hover above the lake.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And none of this is Essence,&quot; I ask. </p><p>&emsp;And Cody nods with ease.</p><p>&emsp;My mind doesn&apos;t even know what to process from what my eyes observe, like the late-night lectures in school when all the cadets are too tired to retain anything. My chest stirs with an animated lightness unlike anything I think I&apos;ve ever felt before, except maybe when I was a young child, and although it scares me &mdash; and it&apos;s probably a little from Cody as the operator &mdash; I feel an odd calmness when I&apos;m next to him, listening to the faint voice he tries to hide when he sings the words to the songs he likes.</p><p>&emsp;The cabin is pleasantly cool despite how hot it might be out there. He gestures to a part of the car that shows a number that resembles the temperature, instead of a thermometer.</p><p>&emsp;I bring my head close to the air conditioning. He asks if I really want to have my hair blown, and lowers the window, filling the space with a deafening gust of air until he lowers his window, telling me to reach my hand beyond the cabin.</p><p>&emsp;We race so fast that the air floods through my fingers like water in a stream, and I realize I&apos;m laughing, but I don&apos;t stop myself too much. We get on the highway, and though he&apos;s apprehensive of whether I&apos;ll try to slice the seat belt and jump out the window, I find it amazing: thrilling that any person could have such an ease of access to the sensation of speed.</p><p>&emsp;There are so many other people of this world inside these cars that I wave at them, but Cody tells me not to. He then demands that I &quot;don&apos;t speak to anyone yet&quot; and &quot;don&apos;t call anything anything to anyone&quot; and to &quot;mask my surprise a little&quot; when we get to our destination.</p><p>&emsp;We get off the highway and end up on slower and smaller roads for a while, stopping at crossroads where some light operator tells us when we can drive. One fellow blares his horn really loud, enough to anger Cody to use some gesture on him, speaking words I can&apos;t yet fully understand, but he calms down when he remembers that I&apos;m here, saying he &quot;forgot that I could smite them.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We end up on a wide square of painted lines in organized rows. Cody stops the automobile between two pairs of them, between two other cars, and instructs me to CAREFULLY! open the car door and not touch the other car door next to me.</p><p>&emsp;I step out into the space between cars, my stomach a little twisted, but my body feeling light. He gestures to a big building with a word that doesn&apos;t translate, because he says it&apos;s a company called Costco, and that they have more stuff to eat and wear and buy than I could ever imagine.</p><p>&emsp;I can feel a hint of the panic set in when I realize I&apos;m surrounded by other commoners of his world for the first time. I&apos;d retreat back into the car if Cody didn&apos;t coax me out by gently grabbing my shirt, telling me that if I stick with him, I&apos;ll be fine.</p><p>&emsp;He offers his hand to me, and I hesitate. But right when I&apos;m about to take it, he pulls away, apologizing, saying that I can walk right next to him.</p><p>&emsp;He points to a row of metal baskets, telling me to grab one. I lift it by the side.

But it seems that all the vendors are owned by the same people &mdash; the dog guy that Cody was talking about.</p><p>&emsp;I spot three exits to the building in case anything happens, Cody tugs the cart past the massive screens, showcasing views of other worlds so real you can&apos;t even see the tiny little dots of color, and I begin to wonder whether it&apos;s a doorway like the one between our homes.</p><p>&emsp;But Cody reads my mind. &quot;Not a portal,&quot; he says. &quot;Those are televisions.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Where do they go?&quot; I ask. &quot;I thought you had to project the pictures from a box.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nowhere.

And to think they all have no Essence at all: something that terrifies me if I imagine they were invaded.</p><p>&emsp;I try to spin up some conversation instead of asking Cody foolish questions. &quot;Say, who is that girl that you admire?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Which one?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The mug girl,&quot; I say. &quot;From work.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He laughs. &quot;Mug girl.

I&apos;m not really sure,&quot; he says. &quot;We used to be really close: we kissed, even. Things were getting good, then she left for college because she was a year ahead of me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I ask, &quot;Did you have intercourse with this woman?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody convulses, grabbing my shoulder before he realizes we&apos;re alone in the aisle. He sighs. &quot;Katiya. You can&apos;t just talk about that out loud,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why not?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because people aren&apos;t always that open to talking about stuff like that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why should we care?&quot; I ask, sincerely.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because it&apos;s etiquette. Sex, drugs, stuff like that, makes people uncomfortable, so it&apos;s better to talk in private.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then how does anyone have . . . that level of engagement in your society?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s on the phone now,&quot; he whispers. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t just walk up to someone and ask for it, would you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, in the poor parts of Northaven, when&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;Don&apos;t answer that,&quot; he says, taking the cart over from me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So this girl,&quot; I start. &quot;The one you didn&apos;t have,&quot; and I almost laugh, &quot;business with.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He sneers at me. &quot;Yeah. We were too young for that, kind of. And then college was busy &mdash; sleeping around and stuff without anything real, and now the stupid, boring, lonely, real world you&apos;re thrust into after all that, when you have to pay off the student loan and become indebted to a piece of land.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But how could you ever be bored or lonely? Bored of this?&quot; She lifts a kids&apos; drawing kit, and then a card with a Nintendo Switch depicted on it. &quot;And how could you be lonely when you&apos;re literally connected to everyone?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Some passersby overhears her rant, and adds, &quot;You&apos;re goddamn right.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then welcome to the modern age, and the biggest problem we&apos;ve created that we can&apos;t solve,&quot; I tell her, turning the corner of the last aisles on the first side of the store that get into the liquor. &quot;Be glad you&apos;re not included in it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you don&apos;t have to do any of that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not when everybody else does,&quot; I muse. &quot;Imagine if everybody spoke a special language, and you decided not to learn it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then they should speak the old language.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The new language has funny pictures in it, though: or it used to be funny pictures. Now it&apos;s just pictures about depression.&quot; She narrows her eyes, without even the faintest thread of understanding to tug at. &quot;Hell, maybe you should just close the door and never come back.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But look at all this.&quot; She gestures to the rows and rows of produce. Whole chickens and hams wrapped in plastic. People filling their carts with an abundance. &quot;How the Res do your people make all this?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s all science,&quot; I say, grabbing a bagged salad that I&apos;ll buy to feel good about myself and probably forget in the back of the refrigerator. &quot;It&apos;s a world that&apos;s connected everywhere. Not a square inch of land uncharted, and we&apos;ve figured out exactly how to trade stuff with each other.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But what about wars and borders? No new land means it&apos;s a war for what&apos;s there, right?&quot; Katiya lifts a clear carton of cotton candy-flavored grapes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please. Just wait for your world to develop the last weapon it ever will: one that can wipe an entire city off a map. One with such power that it leaves the victims as no more than shaded shadows on the wall, giving the survivors illnesses that carry from generation to generation. Then give those weapons to everyone. And then you&apos;ll understand why we don&apos;t dispute those silly lines we shake hands over,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;I realize I&apos;ve gone a little too far when we&apos;re deciding between colors of grapes. Her jaw hangs open. I get the variety pack so Katiya can take them home with her, and usher her to follow me on to the frozen meals section.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You seem to know a lot about war,&quot; she says. &quot;You seem strong for your world. Did you fight?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I say. &quot;But my brother did.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She hesitates to ask the next question, so I answer for her when we step into the large dairy fridge, feeling the same cold he must have felt when he had the bloody holes in his abdomen. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;But he never came back.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just think that&mdash;&quot; war is, but I stop myself, unwilling to go that far this soon.</p><p>&emsp;Katiya fills the space with her own words. &quot;It must have been hard.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s been hard. It was roughly five years ago. Inspired me to make something in college,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;She looks down at her calloused hands, then traces the faint outline of a scar that spans from her eye down her cheek.</p><p>&emsp;I stop her before the pleasantries. &quot;I&apos;d rather not talk about it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She grasps the mesh of the cart as we walk down the frozen food aisle, maybe feeling again that I detest something about her.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But I need frozen stuff for work,&quot; I say, &quot;and maybe you can get something, too.

No . . . second drawer? Nope . . . and third?

I see what . . . can you leave for a minute?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I race back across the threshold. She finagles with the unfamiliar shirt material for about a minute before she says I can come in.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;I crack a smile when I see her wearing the bra over the white surf shirt. I start laughing at her.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot; She asks. &quot;Do I look too much like I&apos;m from your world?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I have to interject between laughs when she wears the upper-body equivalent of socks with sandals. &quot;You look like you belong nowhere! Bra over the shirt? The shirt is the whole point, you fool,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;She fumes as she removes the bra, holding her other shirt in her right hand. &quot;There. Better now, huh?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Should be better for you,&quot; I say, wiping a tear from my eyes as I catch a glimpse of the BILLABONG logo stretched out where my chest might loosely brush against it. And two bumps from the cool mountain air flowing through the back window.</p><p>&emsp;She traces the path of my eyes before I can remove them, and when she realizes what&apos;s got me flustered, she flips the bottom of the shirt up to double-pad her breast, exposing the toned definition in her abs.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You degenerate! Tricking a woman into exposing herself like that?&quot; She reaches for the knife block on the counter again.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, please, I insist!

Without the weight of my chest digging deeper trenches in the flesh of my shoulders, I feel so much lighter: my mind freed enough to take in the sights instead of staving off the thought of suffering.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s morning just like it is in Cody&apos;s world, but the air feels fresher: not saturated with the smell of gas and engines like the capital. Sometimes I wonder if Cody&apos;s world traded the splendor of nature for every other sensation that overstimulates the senses: the taste of meaty crunch shells; the smell tag that hangs from the front mirror of his automobile; the can of meadow-scented musk he sprays around the room when he thinks I&apos;m not looking, to mask the odor of his messes. </p><p>&emsp;And in that absence, I think he&apos;s begun to enjoy this world, even though it first terrified him. He huffs behind me in desperate gasps of breath, pleading every quarter-pass around the bottom of Lake Gaffesend to take a break, pretending it&apos;s because he wants to take in the view.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s incredible,&quot; he says, drenched in sweat that saturates an oversized shirt of mine in an upside-down triangle. &quot;This whole area looks like a natural park. Takes three hours of driving to get anywhere like this in Colorado. I&apos;d dream of living here for leisure!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The words sound so ignorant and pathetic when we&apos;re halfway between Gaffesend and the place my life changed forever. &quot;Leisure,&quot; I repeat.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. My world would have houses all along the shores, with docks and boathouses.&quot; He gestures along the distant northern edge where bodies washed ashore last week. &quot;Families floating in the middle of the lake on pontoon boats. With a meal or something, listening to Jack Johnson and&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Every description he tacks on makes my skin crawl. I feel an anger build that I can only remove with pain, with more running. Maybe it was a mistake bringing out an innocent, yellow-bellied civilian that hasn&apos;t seen the slightest sliver of war and what it causes. Like my pathetic father that was so damn soft his bones crunched beneath that scalding beam that&mdash;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya? Hey, what&apos;s wrong?&quot; Cody asks. My nails bite the flesh of my palms and I can feel my face running hot with my muscles tensed. &quot;Did I upset you? Or did I take too long a break?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Your whole life is a fucking break, I want to say, and I feel my jealousy ride on the threshold of that first rule we wrote together. But I see the earnestness in his expression&mdash; a feeling nobody in my world has the space for &mdash; and it refreshes me, somehow.</p><p>&emsp;I untension my expression. &quot;It&apos;s just that . . . our world has no room for talk like that. We don&apos;t talk in wishes. We only talk about what&apos;s real, and what might be coming.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He purses his lips, tracing an arc of dirt with his toe as he hesitates to look up at me. Seems as if he debates whether to speak his mind on that. &quot;I think that&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya?&quot; Another voice says. &quot;Is that you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;A rush of panic floods my circuits before I can reconcile his name. I glare at Cody, gesturing for him to find somewhere to hide &mdash; though when I turn around to face him, I find someone else shamelessly walking next to him.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian walks with Oriya and several of his friends. He tries to bury some sense of shame that threatens to take over, so he hides it with another string of words. &quot;What are you doing out here? Communing with the bushes?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m going for the run we were supposed to go on,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Supposed to?&quot; He asks. &quot;We agreed to go on two runs every week. And not at week&apos;s end.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But we didn&apos;t even go this week,&quot; I tell him, and noticing how the heat rises, his friends walk ahead. &quot;I thought you said you wanted to spend more time together.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I was going to tell you,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;But you never go on patrol, staying in the town. So it feels like you hardly want to spend time with me, and I&apos;m trying to do the quests that feel like they actually prepare me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My eyes dart between the trail and the underbrush where Cody hides. While Jullian makes his case for ignorance, Cody&apos;s expression cycles between disbelief and anger on my behalf, but I shake my head at him, insisting we keep our worlds separate.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian notices my lapse in attention. &quot;No, what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just . . . don&apos;t buy it,&quot; I say. &quot;If you really cared about us, about all those years we spent together fighting for a chance at this side of the warfront &mdash; if you really cherished what we built together, you would make an effort. Even the smallest thing!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I did make an effort,&quot; Jullian says. &quot;We spent the entire end of last week together!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That was about an hour. And it was before you insisted on meeting your friends at the bar!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I asked for you to come. And just like the celebration all those weeks ago, you refused to even try meeting other people in the Guard.&quot; He looks around to make sure no one else is around. &quot;Look. I didn&apos;t want to bring this up, but I get it if you&apos;re humiliated about what happened. The other guards have been talking, but I&apos;ve been standing up for you,&quot; he says. &quot;Every chance I get. And it&apos;s exhausting.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What I wanted was for you to stand with me. How can we stay close if all you ever do is support me from a distance? I needed you that night. Why didn&apos;t you even come check on me? Why did you choose your friends over me again?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because . . . it&apos;s just a lot, you know. You have this brilliant energy about you. The reason I love you. But ever since we came to Gaffesend, it feels like you&apos;ve changed. So much fuller of these plagues of anxiety and panic, and&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Are you coming or not, Jullian?&quot; one of his friends says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just a minute,&quot; he shouts, before turning to me again. &quot;And I&apos;m trying to calm down. To get us to calm down, because we&apos;ve made it here, and we have no reason to be so afraid.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What does that have anything to do with being there for me?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because I&apos;m tired, Katiya. And&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody makes a motion with the zipper on his trousers and cuts across the brush behind Jullian, giving him a start. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;God abo&mdash; I mean, Gods above, I&apos;m glad we stopped for a minute,&quot; he says, stretching his legs a couple times as my boyfriend turns to confront my housemate. Even though Jullian might be taller and fully Essenced, he looks like a beanpole compared to Cody. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Who the res are you?&quot; Jullian asks. Then the strangest sense of recognition overtakes him. &quot;Oh. You&apos;re that strange scientist from the Royal Academy! With the glowing square.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yep,&quot; Cody says. &quot;No idea what this disagreement is about. But your friend was getting upset about all the missed runs, and needed a running partner. So I filled in.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s my girlfriend,&quot; he says. A certain calculus plays in his head, shrivelling his face in a sneer as his mind re-runs the social arithmetic. &quot;And you live close by?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. We&apos;re next door-neighbors. The Royal Academy put me here in the military district. Since the houses are already sanctioned for the fighting types, and it&apos;s not always a full class that rolls through every time, they had a couple units left over.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Jullian&apos;s eyes flash between the two of us, and to his friends slowly vanishing down the path. I watch a certain confidence change inside of him.</p><p>&emsp;Cody laughs. &quot;She&apos;s really your girlfriend? I swear, I never see you over there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because I&apos;ve been busy,&quot; he insists.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, don&apos;t get too busy, then,&quot; Cody says. Your girl is beautiful. And if you don&apos;t spend enough time with her, she might just run away.&quot; Cody&apos;s eyes narrow with a humored smile. &quot;With someone else.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Jullian! Come on. It&apos;s gonna be dark before we get back,&quot; his friends shout.</p><p>&emsp;Cody says, &quot;You&apos;re already in the clothes for it. Wanna finish this run with us and ditch your friends? I have some . . . designing stuff . . . to do after this, so I can&apos;t stick around.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Jullian hesitates. His eyes meet mine as he squirms between choices, but after a while, it seems the guilt isn&apos;t strong enough. &quot;I already have plans. But let&apos;s go tomorrow. How about I stay over tonight?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And stay?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. And we&apos;ll go tomorrow,&quot; Jullian says, starting to run in the opposite direction to catch up with the other cadets.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You sure?&quot; Cody asks, but Jullian&apos;s already running away. He turns to me, squinting his eyes with a smug grin. &quot;I can see why you like him so much.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And why&apos;s that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He runs even more than you do,&quot; Cody says. &quot;You found the only man whose mental gymnastics can outpace your neurotic level of fitness.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, shut up,&quot; I tell him. But instead of finding a vacant space inside my chest, I find it filled with something else. </p><p>&emsp;A sense of reassurance.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What a loser,&quot; Cody says. &quot;So many guys I&apos;ve met in my life like him: especially back in college. Do you really have no other options? In my world, you&apos;d never pay for a drink in your life!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I think of all my female friends from the capital that settled in with children at a young age. Their softness and tenderness. And the way the other men we went out with would look at me: no more than a friend; as almost another guy; unsightly with all the scars from my past. &quot;Not ever in this world,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then this world sucks,&quot; Cody says. &quot;You&apos;re hot.&quot; Then adds, &quot;But it&apos;s too bad I don&apos;t fall for people that stab me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But this world is all I have,&quot; I tell him. &quot;And your world is all you have. And Jullian really loves me. We got each other through training, watched each other&apos;s sibllings, supported each other enough to make it here, we did everything together!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But people can change. And now he&apos;s a small fish in a much bigger lake.&quot; He stretches his legs as he digs his heels into the dirt, preparing to make it back without a break.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But he&apos;s all I have,&quot; I say, and I mean it.

He crushes the ale almost as fast as Ryder and Pax do, because he was in some alcohol training program in college &mdash; at least from how he explained it to me.</p><p>&emsp;I managed to gather all of us at the front of the bar: Aldrin wasn&apos;t lying when he said drinking is all you really had to do when the week ends. Naya wets her tongue with a glass of water on the end, too nervous to talk. Bertram, Ryder, and Pax crowd around the middle seat where Cody tries to remember all the important details.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The device you showed us that night was really interesting,&quot; Ryder says. &quot;How did you make it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Some new non-Essenced technology that runs on electricity,&quot; Cody says. &quot;Who says you&apos;re always going to have access to Essence?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So it&apos;s for the people, then? Guards are always brimming with Essence,&quot; Bertram says. &quot;But I can see how that would be useful for the civilians.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody swirls the mug around, probably wondering why I stick to water like the Ahkvasan. &quot;Yeah.&quot; He turns to Naya. &quot;So. You&apos;re actually part cat?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My other friends are taken aback by his sudden outburst.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Where the Res are you from?&quot; Bertram asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You can&apos;t just say that,&quot; Pax insists, as Cody disappears behind his mug. &quot;Even to half-bloods.&quot; He turns to me. &quot;Where did you say he was from again?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh . . .&quot; I try to think of the most remote place I can think of. &quot;From Blackwater?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m from Blackwater!&quot; Ryder exclaims.</p><p>&emsp;Fuck.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What part of the city did you live in?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Uh . . . north?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No way,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s where I was from. How did you make it out?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody glares at me for help, but not even I know anything about Blackwater. He defaults to the basics. &quot;With my, uh, technology.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Did you develop for the Academy? How the Res did you survive the frosthards? Not even this snowdrifter kid I knew growing up, er . . . my brother&apos;s friend . . . could stay out there for more than a couple days.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t think he really wants to talk about it,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;Cody looks relieved as he finishes the last swig.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I get it,&quot; Ryder says. &quot;I gave up a lot getting away from that frostbitten prison.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Our group fills the silence with a few sips. But Naya surprises us when she speaks up.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, not a lot of Humans up here have seen the Ahkvasa,&quot; she says. &quot;Only fire-blooded people survive up here. Our race lives in the jungles. Far from the cold.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So what can you do?&quot; Cody asks.</p><p>&emsp;She raises the water glass that&apos;s empty besides a few drips, turning it over in the air, allowing the last drip of water to exit the rim of the glass. </p><p>&emsp;Then she focuses. </p><p>&emsp;The drip decelerates to a slow crawl as it floats through the air. and the harder she squints her jade eyes, the slower it travels, until it almost reaches a halt.</p><p>&emsp;Cody&apos;s jaw drops as she relinquishes her control, allowing the drop to splatter against the table. &quot;You can float things?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Float?&quot; Naya laughs: a rare sight, probably thinking he&apos;s even more ignorant than Pax. But it&apos;s refreshing to re-experience the most mundane aspects of the world through a new set of eyes. &quot;Time dilation.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Time travel?&quot; Cody asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; Naya says. &quot;You can&apos;t go back, only slow things down. This world doesn&apos;t have time travel. Unless, maybe, if you&apos;re a Mask or something.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh. In my world&mdash;&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I slap my hand against his chest. </p><p>&emsp;He coughs. &quot;Excuse me. In my town, we called them furries. But they&apos;d wear these suits. Pretty impressive.&quot; He then realizes Ryder is present, glaring at him quizzically, and adds, &quot;but only in a small area, after this one incident where this guy, uh . . . nevermind.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You sure you&apos;re from Blackwater?&quot; Ryder asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe he&apos;s one of those weird rich types, dressed like that,&quot; Pax says.</p><p>&emsp;Cody digs himself further. &quot;Had to escape my family. They were crazy.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No kidding, damn Merlot. How they can lie to a whole people and keep their composure like that,&quot; Ryder says. He claps Cody on the back. &quot;Makes me respect you if you wisened up when you had it all like that. I like you, Cody. That must have been hard: harder than anything I&apos;ve ever been through.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody hangs his head. &quot;Thanks, bro.&quot; He takes a swig. &quot;So anyways, how do you all know Katiya?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody continues to interrogate each of my friends, and despite the odd force that transforms his language into mine, he speaks with such a charisma that they don&apos;t even realize all the questions he&apos;s asking.</p><p>&emsp;He manages to get their opinions of Jullian. He learns of my connection to Bertram, and how he saved me on the night of the fire. He even manages to develop a few in-jokes with them, calling Bertram &quot;Barry&quot; and coaxing Pax to do his frozen shotglass trick.</p><p>&emsp;By the time it&apos;s over, it&apos;s like he&apos;s &quot;one of the boys.&quot; And when the sun crosses the top of the window, casting its rays to signify midday has passed, we bid goodbye to them, asking again where Cody lives, to which he responds with a generic answer.</p><p>&emsp;We walk back in silence in our running clothes. I notice the absence of a pain that used to dig into my shoulders.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m exhausted,&quot; Cody says when we cross the entry door. &quot;I&apos;m good at acting like I&apos;m social, but my battery runs out fast.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You did well today,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You think they liked me?&quot; He asks, showing the last sliver of energy he&apos;s stored for our goodbye. &quot;Not that I care what they think. I&apos;ll probably never see them again.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;They liked you a lot,&quot; I say. &quot;Maybe they didn&apos;t buy every lie, but you gave them a good time.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He scratches the back of his head. &quot;Say. I know we made that rule to not get too invested in each other&apos;s lives, but how about we help each other out?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you have Jullian, and that childhood friend that likes you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Bertram?&quot; I ask. &quot;Not a chance. We&apos;re like siblings with how we grew up.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How cliche,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nothing. But if I help you with Jullian and your denial of feelings for the other guy, how about you help me with mine?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask for a second time.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I got this girl I&apos;ve liked for a while,&quot; Cody says. &quot;The one we talked about at Costco. And you&apos;re a girl. Maybe we could help each other out.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It would keep us in our worlds,&quot; I say. &quot;Not longing to cross this door and live on the other side forever.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Exactly. Because we sure as hell aren&apos;t getting together,&quot; Cody says. &quot;I&apos;ll keep Jullian on his toes. And you help me with Kei. Because if we&apos;re forced to share the same space, we might as well help each other.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I think that will work just fine,&quot; I say.</p>"},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"40","GivenName":"Back To Business","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Four","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Eighteen","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":4,"ChapterFull":18,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":67,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"First Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"64","Synopsis":"Cody returns to work to start his design.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.18","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"06/11/26","FantasyTime":"2A-128, 84th of Suntide","StoryDay":"Thursday","Setting":"Navidson-Monroe Battery Division"},"DocName":"17 // &quot;Back To Business&quot;","Body":""},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":1,"AutoNameFull":47,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":4,"ChapterFull":18,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":1,"SceneFull":47,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":68,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"Paragate, Cody","UUID":"65","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Cody returns to work to begin the project after redlines.

He&apos;s approached almost every engineer in the office to ask their opinion about his design choices, and now he&apos;s back there with Wilbur, preventing him from dozing back off into his &quot;wake apnea&quot;.</p><p>&emsp;I scratch away at the yellow engineering pad, sketching my own ideas instead of relying on others all the damn time. It&apos;s easy to draw in 3D when it&apos;s just a plate with a few holes in it: far different from the radical ideas my adversary is coming up with.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s up with all the rounds?&quot; Wilbur asks. &quot;It costs a lot of money to ask the machinist to clean up every edge like that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh. I never thought about that,&quot; Reed says.</p><p>&emsp;Because he&apos;s never been in a machine shop, I think to myself.</p><p>&emsp;Wilbur rambles for another thirty minutes about the history of drafting. Reed eagerly nods his head, and I think it&apos;s beyond the level where he&apos;s just listening until he can escape. All the while, I consider the different ways I can design the enclosure, sketching several different designs between scrolls through social media to keep up on the people I used to know.</p><p>&emsp;He pops up like a jump-scare when I have my head down, trying to skip an ad about a freemium game. &quot;What have you come up with so far?&quot; Reed asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not much, really.&quot; He should probably learn on his own that designing for aesthetics gets you shot down harder than a Russian jet over American airspace. &quot;Mostly just figuring out how to enclose the thing.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; he says. He turns his new computer over to me, showing his model of parts that aren&apos;t put together yet. &quot;I&apos;m not very good at assembling things yet with this new software.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Too familiar with SolidWorks?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How did you know?&quot; He asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Who isn&apos;t,&quot; I say. &quot;I hate this software. But I&apos;ve been forced to use it for so long I&apos;ve used it ten times as much as all the SolidWorks in undergrad.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re smart for a relatively new guy,&quot; Reed says, laying the compliments on thick like he does with damn near everyone. &quot;We&apos;ll be fast friends,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;Sure, I think.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; I say, amicably.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So what did you do over the weekend?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I talk like the other middle-aged men, minus the stuff about the yard I don&apos;t have. &quot;Not much, just went to Costco and went on a run.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We missed you at the work social,&quot; Reed says. &quot;Is it true you&apos;ve never been to one of them?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just get tired easy.&quot; And then I whisper, &quot;I get enough home improvement and little-league talk in the stand-up meetings.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Even Kei made it,&quot; Reed says. &quot;She said she tried to call you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. I just wasn&apos;t feeling too great.&quot; I start sketching on the yellow pad to try to look busy enough to get him to leave.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well I hope I&apos;ll see you next time,&quot; Reed says. He exits to the floor, off to bother some underpaid union technicians with even more stuff they&apos;ll have to assemble. I continue sketching on the notepad, returning the headphones to my ears I bought after I lost Jackson&apos;s iPod Classic.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Quite the eager fella,&quot; Wilbur says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say. &quot;I guess it hasn&apos;t gotten to him yet.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I see him peek his head from the divider into the narrow alley: a balding Asian man with glasses and light wrinkles. &quot;Has it gotten to you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I say. The rusted wall fan makes enough noise that only Wilbur can hear my words, so I feel like I&apos;m able to speak openly. &quot;I think I just had a different idea of what engineering was. I liked designing things. But it was when something happened to me &mdash; or to someone in my family, I guess &mdash; that really made me chase it.&quot; I look at the 3D-printed mini model on my desk that I made to show my brother all those years ago. He was amazed by it: so similar to the tech he got to use in the military.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So I&apos;m guessing it wasn&apos;t batteries,&quot; he says, narrowing his eyes in a sagacious smile.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;More so flying things. But smaller. And not for people,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Drones,&quot; he says. And when he answers right, I hand him the little geometric prototype. &quot;This is really cool! When did you make this? And did you make a full-size one?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say. &quot;For Senior Design: after the incident, they let me pretty much be my own sponsor if I could fork the cash.&quot; I feel a rare sense of passion flood my body, and for a moment, I feel almost like Reed. &quot;I led the team to develop it: they let me take on some junior engineers at the school. And you see those gears?&quot; I point at a small pattern in the lines of PLA plastic.</p><p>&emsp; &quot;Yeah. Heck &mdash; if this is like 1:10 scale, those must have been really small,&quot; Wilbur says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Took us damn near a month to find a solution for that. Bevel gears? And that small, with a D-shaft that didn&apos;t fit any existing gears we could order?&quot; My chest runs with the excitement of those days as my tongue spouts off with jargon. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t believe what we had to do to make it work. Last month of a senior project we had a whole year for, and that was the last thing we had to resolve.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Gearbox design is fun,&quot; he muses. &quot;So how did you do it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Get this: one of the teammates&apos; moms knew another mom that ran a jewelry company. They did lost wax castings&mdash; you know, where they pour in the molten metal to take the shape of the wax?&quot; I pause, realizing I&apos;m talking to a lifer. &quot;No, I&apos;m stupid. Of course you know that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Wilbur laughs, egging me on.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Anyways, we got this jewelry company to make our gears. Arrived the last week: only a single shot to get them right. And they were perfect: each wrapped in an individually-wrapped vellum bag as if we&apos;d put them on stings and wear them around our neck,&quot; I say, out of breath with excitement, and when I realize the fan has been off for a while, I find Nav and Kei standing at the other end of the cube.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s really awesome, Cody,&quot; Naveen says. &quot;Why did you never tell us about that before?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And you didn&apos;t even tell the best part,&quot; Kei says.</p><p>&emsp;My face flushes with humiliation, always uncomfortable when I&apos;m the center of attention. &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I mutter, &quot;which part?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He won best in show for his year,&quot; Kei said.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, please,&quot; I beg. &quot;I had an uplifting story. And they have a reputation to uphold&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;And the president of the university took him on a little tour to speak on campus. The press got involved. And he got his story in the Los Angeles Times, can you believe that?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She points to the article that hangs on the wall of my cubicle:</p><p><span class=CodyHand msgnote>BROTHER OF FALLEN SOLDIER DESIGNS THE FUTURE</span></p><p>&emsp;Beneath the big font on the front page are two pictures: one of Jackson and I when we were kids, and a photo of me directing my team in a suit &mdash; that last hour of the project when we were rushing in full suits and dresses, wearing smocks over our formal clothes, spray-painting the prototype black.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. It was fun. And that&apos;s why I&apos;m here,&quot; I say. But the high from that memory leaves when reality returns: I freeze my face in the genuine smile I had a minute ago not to lose it, to insist redlines for battery enclosures shouldn&apos;t be any different.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I sure was proud of my boy,&quot; a voice says.</p><p>&emsp;I realize it&apos;s lunchtime. </p><p>&emsp;My father Alan, a technician, steps between Kei and Nav.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s right. You told us a little about Cody before the interview,&quot; Nav says.</p><p>&emsp;Dad scratches his salt-and-pepper beard. &quot;Yeah. He used to build things with me in the garage. Now he just designs things on that computer, thinking that&apos;s the real world and all!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Alright, that&apos;s enough, Dad,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You didn&apos;t even finish my redline. The one with your name on the drawing? Those two damn 5/16-18 hex screws that are so close they can&apos;t fit a ratchet on them? I put a toolbox together for you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Alright,&quot; I repeat, grabbing my keys.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;Not that Harbor Freight shit. I&apos;m talking Snap-On, Gear Wrench, and you must not even touch that stuff if you&apos;re that blind to it!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The three engineers laugh as I rush to push my greasy father out the door.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":48,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":4,"ChapterFull":18,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":48,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":69,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"Paragate, Cody","UUID":"66","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Grinds hard at work alone.

He says some choice words about the people around him. Then the gossip from the floor, saying how the men he works with whine more than &quot;any of those housewife shows the stay-at-home moms watch.&quot; And by the time we walk in the door of the Wendy&apos;s, he&apos;s silent enough for us to order and sit in one of the plastic booths, wetting his hands with a bottle of Purell before wiping the sullied table with his dirtier work shirt.</p><p>&emsp;I glance at the play structure from the nineties that I used to play in, when my father drove down the canyon to meet the rest of our family, spending no longer than the time we have now to check in with us. He worked two shifts for the overtime, to give my brother and I enough to flourish with a full childhood, and when he catches me lost in that memory, he gestures to one of the structure&apos;s cross-bars zip-tied to a pool noodle.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You almost broke your nose on that damn thing,&quot; my father says. &quot;You remember?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, I remember,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Chasing Jackson down the slide. He ducked and I didn&apos;t see it, then I spouted so much damn blood&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like a fountain. And your mother was so panicked,&quot; he laughs, &quot;tearing a whole stack of napkins one-by-one out of the dispenser, while I was smart enough to ask the front for a whole roll of paper towels!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I chuckle. &quot;Those were times.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Good times?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Good enough to remember,&quot; I tell him, just as the tray arrives with our dollar-menu burgers.</p><p>&emsp;He picks the pickles out of one of his, then takes a deep bite before rubbing his mouth with a napkin. I bite into mine just as he opens his mouth to speak, halfway through a mouthful. &quot;You know I meant what I said back there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;About the redlines.&quot; I dip my fries in ketchup.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, doofus,&quot; he says, staring at me with piercing eyes like mine. &quot;About the project.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The drone,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot; He takes another bite, and hunger blocks his next thought for another thirty seconds or so. &quot;You made me so proud that day. I hope you still have that project.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I do,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Have you worked any further on it since you moved out?

After the service at Fort Dietz. After I read that last letter, I had burning purpose, you know? If I didn&apos;t stop, I think that truth would break me entirely.&quot; I sink my teeth into the burger again, distracting myself enough with something savory to prevent the habit of those feelings from coming back.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We each had our own ways of dealing with it,&quot; my father says. &quot;You either channel that empty feeling or it snags you. Catching up in every little moment of those habits he shaped in us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;We closed his bedroom door for months, petrified the exact way he left it. And we were too afraid to open it, just saving that last experience of throwing open the door like the last voicemails on our phones.</p><p>&emsp;Because once the door was opened, he&apos;d remain nothing more than a memory, forever.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You reminded me a little of him today,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh yeah?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you&apos;re the age he was now. Your voices sound alike. And when I was done with that soyboy man-bun kid, ragging me over with questions about some stupid enclosure design&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I laugh. &quot;You mean Reed?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah, whatever. But anyways, when I came up the metal stairs to the room with all the office pukes, I almost thought I heard your brother.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just never hear you passionate like that, son,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.

The lifers: satisfied with slow work that never changes, with such tribal knowledge that they&apos;d take the whole company down with them if they died.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That sounds like me without the experience,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you&apos;re not,&quot; Dad says, shaking another fry at me. &quot;You have passion!

The lifers leave early: forced to come in when it&apos;s still dark out so they can take care of their teenagers &mdash; or if they don&apos;t have kids, maybe drink at the bar or something. The young type-A engineers leave a little after so they can make the most of summer&apos;s long evenings, whether it&apos;s running or biking  out on the trails in the open fields between the housing developments, or finding the motivation somewhere to run a load of laundry.</p><p>&emsp;Then Nav leaves, and Reed and Kei say goodbye to him. Then Reed tries to talk to Kei, the only one left in the section, who responds with short yes-and-no answers unless he throws a free-response question at her. Then Reed drags a bunch of virtual cards around his computer, playing Solitaire for almost an hour until he can clock out half an hour longer than eight hours. Then he says goodbye to Kei, then it&apos;s absolutely silent for an hour beyond Kei&apos;s mouse clicks, and when 5:00 rolls around, I shoulder my bag and wave goodbye to the workaholic girl I have a crush on, reminding her that there&apos;s still a world out there.</p><p>&emsp;But this time, it felt different. And it&apos;s consistently felt a little different. Maybe Dad is right that I&apos;ve changed, because instead of leaving the long dragging hours of boredom to find respite in inaction, there&apos;s a part of me that wonders what&apos;s happening on the other side of the door.</p><p>&emsp;But it isn&apos;t much, and ever since I photocopied the rule sheet that Katiya and I wrote up, the first and last rule catch my eye every time I reach to open the door. Maybe it&apos;s just the prospect of that mystical threshold that fills me with excitement. Maybe it&apos;s the images and feelings she&apos;s left me with that I still fight like hell to resist. Or maybe it&apos;s fear of what could happen, overriding the boredom of modern life that comes when you get on the other side of adolescence.</p><p>&emsp;The house is silent when I pull in: the garage door groans as its panels screech back in place. Sometimes I imagine finding her sitting there with a bag of my chips in her combat armor, watching Netflix, but she&apos;s been so busy the last week or so, and even though I haven&apos;t found a reason to unlock my side of the door since we last went for that run, I feel the urge to let in a chance for something to happen.</p>"},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"30","GivenName":"Bonus&mdash;Overnight","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Five","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Nineteen","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":5,"ChapterFull":19,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":71,"Label":"Paragate&mdash;Bonus","Status":"First Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"68","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.19","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"06/12/26","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Friday","Setting":"Hearthland Ridge Estates"},"DocName":"17*1 // BONUS: &quot;Overnight&quot;","Body":""},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":1,"AutoNameFull":50,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":5,"ChapterFull":19,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":1,"SceneFull":50,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":72,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"69","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.19.50","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-49a","Body":"<p>&emsp;I stumble through the dark since the window shades block twilight, leaving only three faint rectangles from the textured glass in the front door. The mounted television blinks blue, probably wise on me with all the automation tech &mdash; predicting that I&apos;ll waste another two hours scrolling through mediocre streaming selections before giving up to scroll on my phone.</p><p>&emsp;I check my messages. Two from Reed, averaging five a week: half about design work and half setting up a half-baked punchline. A text from my mother if I want anything from Costco. A picture from my college friends in California that got together, saying that they love me and miss me. And a text from Kei, saying she ran into our old Student Government advisor from high school.</p><p>&emsp;I break the cycle and decide to try making something for once, with the pots and pans that don&apos;t have so much as a burn mark worn into them. Instead of staving off Door Dash with another frozen meal, I decide to make spaghetti, finding the ingredients from months before when my mother hoarded all these goods to get me started.</p><p>&emsp;But I find myself walking to the door first: on a pathetic strand of hope, still caught up in the image of that improbable future. My stupid hand twists the lock in the door, fielding an array of excuses for why I&apos;d bother wedging myself back into the life of a girl with a fantasy boyfriend. The gusts from your world are better, and it seemed cooler over there, I think. I thought I heard an actual intruder this time. Or maybe I&apos;m bored. But no. That would be cringe.</p><p>&emsp;I settle on door unlocked, and feeling a little brave, I open the door a little: just so I can blame it on the wind if the door cracks. Cracking from being open, of course, because I was checking if the gateway was still there, but then something happened and I totally forgot to close it. </p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m not interested in her: only for that deal we made to help each other out a little (maybe), and maybe to go on another run or something. Stirring the pot of noodles, I think of the shape of her body when that skin-tight wetsuit was against her, wondering what else is under there, and then I shake my head, considering just going to bed so I can sleep in extra late and maybe get in to work, like, fifteen minutes early.</p><p>&emsp;But the air of my world floats into hers from the difference in pressure. It&apos;s warmer in my world. And when a gust flutters in, crashing the window shades against the wall, the aroma of simple spaghetti pushes enough to slam the door. </p><p>&emsp;But something catches it.</p><p>&emsp;Someone catches it?</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hello?&quot; I try, stirring faster.</p><p>&emsp;The door hinges back just a little.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey there,&quot; she says, for the first time in a week or so. &quot;I wasn&apos;t leaning against the door or anything.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Leaning against the door?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, I was in my kitchen,&quot; she clarifies, peeking her head through the door. &quot;On the other side of my house.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; I say, not sure how it&apos;s relevant.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But I smell you&apos;re cooking something. Smells great,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. Just some saucy noodles,&quot; I say, since spaghetti isn&apos;t a cognate. &quot;I always make extra for leftovers, you know.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Leftovers?&quot; She asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. Like extra food.&quot; She still peeks her head in. &quot;You can come in, you know,&quot; I say. &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;re enemies anymore.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m just never sure whether it&apos;s alright to come over, since I don&apos;t want to intrude or anything.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t go over because I hate getting attacked,&quot; I say, expecting a sly comeback. But she just looks tired. </p><p>&emsp;She shrugs. Her steel boots clatter on the linoleum as she advances to the marble counter, taking a seat at the table.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sorry. I meant that as a joke,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know,&quot; she says. &quot;Things have just been really slow. Concerningly slow.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And you&apos;re not afraid?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The front line&apos;s been pushed east almost as far as it&apos;s ever been.&quot; She twirls the sharp point of her dagger against the counter, brushing her hair to the side.</p><p>&emsp;I turn the heat off. &quot;And how&apos;s your distant, brooding boyfriend? Still both of those things?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It got better for a little while, after that run you set up for us,&quot; Katiya says. &quot;Oh, and how about you and that old flame of yours? Kei?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No fire here. Besides work talk and sending funny pictures to each other,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I thought your people were too advanced to speak in pictures,&quot; she says. A smile shows she&apos;s warming up just a little bit.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The Internet has ruined a lot of things for us,&quot; I tell her. I retrieve two bowls from the cabinet. &quot;Here. Want to try something else from my world? I promise it&apos;s not too intense on flavor.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We salt just about everything so it keeps, so I don&apos;t think it will ever be too much. None of us can afford those fancy new ice boxes,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;I hand her a serving. She&apos;s about to take a bite before she asks something else.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Say,&quot; she starts. &quot;I know &apos;boring&apos; in my world is intense for you, but it&apos;s boring. So . . . what do you do when you&apos;re bored?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Jerk off, I almost say.</p><p>&emsp;But I stop myself. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Play games. And, uh, stalk other people&apos;s lives online. And watch movies and shows,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Or read a book, if the power is out.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I was wondering if you could show me one of the films,&quot; she says. She takes a slurp of spaghetti. A look of sudden pleasure arrests her, and then she ravenously takes another bite.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; I ask, feeling a little excited. I toss my backpack on the small chair so only the couch is open, before I realize what I&apos;m doing.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How do you get these pictures? Do you have to go somewhere in the car to get a reel?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nope,&quot; I say, settling in on the right side of the futon as I gesture to the space next to me. &quot;The nineties is over. They&apos;re all inside the box right there.&quot; I lift the remote and press the power button. The screen lights up with several selections: the criteria a little different now that one of us hasn&apos;t seen a single one of them.</p><p>&emsp;She sets the plate on the kitchen counter, removing the light armor from her body with a gasp of relief. I find her wearing the surf shirt underneath: still stretched in the logo, and I hope she&apos;s washed it since last time.</p><p>&emsp;She plops down next to me, taking more of the pasta into her mouth with another slurp. &quot;So those are all the choices?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s called a menu,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Like in a restaurant.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; she says. &quot;But there are so many choices!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I laugh. &quot;That&apos;s the problem with my world. So how about this: what kind of story do you want to watch?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She looks puzzled. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like an action movie? A funny movie? Fantasy? Futuristic? Or a&mdash;&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about that one?&quot; She points to the top left corner. &quot;Two people meeting each other sounds like a simple start. Not too crazy, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s, uh . . . probably a little too intense for you, I think.&quot; My face flushes.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please,&quot; she says, flexing an arm: &quot;I&apos;m more adventurous than you&apos;ll ever be. Whatever this missus Sally and mister Harry are doing can&apos;t be that bad!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That movie is a romance story,&quot; I say. &quot;A romantic comedy. And your world hasn&apos;t even invented two-piece swimsuits yet. I think you&apos;d faint before the title card!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Her face reddens. &quot;A romantic story? But isn&apos;t that so shameless?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;And then the preview loads, after I left the cursor on it for too long. </p><p>&emsp;Sally gets a little too flustered in the restaurant, moaning loudly with erotic pleasure. Katiya flinches, slapping the remote out of my hand and blasting it across the room with two of its batteries. I scramble to pick up the pieces in the darkness as the scene plays out: Katiya&apos;s face flushing further into a rose color as she laughs uncomfortably.</p><p>&emsp;I manage to slide the double-A batteries in and take control, switching over to something else: that Gerard Butler flick where he has a talk show about romance.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So indecent,&quot; she says, covering her mouth and her eyes as she giggles: too innocent for such adulterous media, though I doubt she&apos;s a stranger to the concept.</p><p>&emsp;I return to my spot on the couch. &quot;Wait a second . . . You&apos;ve never been that pleasured over a meal?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; she says. &quot;Do your people do that? No &mdash; your people don&apos;t do that. No. No . . . do they?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course!&quot; I say. &quot;I expected you to be weak in the knees after this bitchin&apos; bowl of spaghetti.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re lying.&quot; She rubs her cheeks, but they don&apos;t get any paler. And when she finds my smug grin from between her fingers, she punches me in the arm. &quot;You&apos;re lying!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Alright, fine. But it&apos;s getting late. Can we pick something, already?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about that one?&quot; She points to the picture of a small rabbit standing in front of a train.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just watched that one the other week,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;I scan around a little longer. And since Lord Of The Rings is too long, I settle on The Hunger Games.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why this one?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The main character reminds me of you,&quot; I tell her. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please, just tell me it&apos;s not a romance,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s mostly action. Strong female lead and a boy that&apos;s a baker,&quot; I tell her. &quot;But every story has to have a little bit of romance.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She turns to me with disgust.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I didn&apos;t mean it like that. I swear,&quot; I tell her. </p><p>&emsp;She ducks her head so her bangs cover her eyes. &quot;Well . . . there&apos;s nothing wrong with a little bit, you know,&quot; she says, twirling a strand of hair.</p><p>&emsp;I shift my eyes from the screen.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Like, in a picture,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;And then Katiya watches the first movie she&apos;s ever seen.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":51,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":5,"ChapterFull":19,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":51,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":73,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"70","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.19.51","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-49b","Body":"<p>&emsp;I awake at 4:30 to find her breathing softly next to me: a line of drool sliding down my chin, and her hands tensioned on my arm as she buries her face into my shoulder, flinching sporadically.</p><p>&emsp;The autoplay ran so long that it stopped on the third one before asking if we were STILL WATCHING.

I hear their whispers when I pass &mdash; or maybe half the time I think I hear them &mdash; calling me &quot;choke&quot; and making a gagging motion, or asking again why I even bothered, some even saying I&apos;d be better suited &quot;for the shady brothels where I could at least be paid to choke on something.&quot; Gossip is easy. Giving up is easy, too: but when I feel the weight of the house key in my pocket, trying to estimate how much heavier it was before the first cadet failed their trials, I remember the other choice is death, and it&apos;s a much stronger wind in my sails than whatever storm these troglodytes can throw at me.</p><p>&emsp;My shoulder scrapes the left wall as I take every narrow alley I can. It&apos;s the first day I&apos;ve decided to visit him, because for the last two weeks, I&apos;ve rued the thought of leaving the infirmary to face their ridicule in broad daylight, though none of them have ever faced anything close to what I&apos;ve fought.</p><p>&emsp;His messages told me that he&apos;d crack the back door of his room in the single-story medical building, and when I find some old, thick tome called FEAR THE CHYMAERA wedged in one of the doors, I cautiously creak it open.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So you finally came to check on me,&quot; Bertram says.

Said I can&apos;t start training again for another two weeks or so.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh,&quot; I say. I sit at the chair next to the window. Between the gravel lot outside and the brutal concrete walls, it feels more like a prison infirmary than anything else. &quot;I think I&apos;d get sicker just by staying in this room,&quot; I say. &quot;Do you get to walk around outside, at least?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not really,&quot; he says. &quot;But thinking of the effort you guys put into saving me, it makes me feel full.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I smile. &quot;You&apos;re worth it.

A drawing of the two of us floats across the floor, and I recognize the artistry from my father.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;When was this?&quot; I ask. &quot;And why was it here?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He blushes: the first sign of life I&apos;ve seen on his pallid face as he holds two bottles. &quot;Just remembering the ones that got me through it,&quot; he says, and then he hands me one. &quot;Ryder and Pax and Naya came by last week. They smuggled in a six-pack, so we had four of them. But I saved two for the day you came back.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I laugh, looking around cautiously as I grasp the neck of the bottle. The Essenced heat of my hands heats the metal cap enough for it to expand, popping off with a light thunk, and we cheers over half-a-success and half-a-failure. </p><p>&emsp;But I can tell something is still on his mind. And after he wets his mouth a couple times with the ale, quickly chugging so we can hide the evidence, he finally speaks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You know, I thought about some stuff when I was on the edge,&quot; he says, sitting on the left side of the hospital bed in his white gown. &quot;I thought about all the things I hadn&apos;t done yet. That I regretted putting off.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I understand that fear completely,&quot; I say, as I sit beside him. &quot;The world is so random and chaotic, sometimes it makes you wonder if the Gods stopped watching a long time ago. But you&apos;ve been blessed with more time.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;More time to express my feelings,&quot; he says: a look of hesitation on his face. &quot;In the week I was on the brink of death, I wrote letters in case I didn&apos;t make it. But then I survived. I started healing quickly, and with a second shot, I decided I should go back to the place it all began.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My stomach twists at the thought. &quot;You&apos;ve lived don&apos;t mean&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And not alone,&quot; he says. &quot;I want to go back to the place our lives changed forever. I want to go to Hillfar with you, and I want to tell you something. And that&apos;s why,&quot; he reaches behind his back to retrieve two familiar forms, &quot;I insisted that the guildscribes make it official.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Going back there. I mean&mdash;&quot; I stammer.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;If you&apos;re not ready yet, I get it. But I think it would be good for us, and I just wanted you to be aware, so you can prepare yourself.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I look at the quest form: neatly written in the script of the guildscribes. A high-value, four-star quest, with the purpose written in Bertram&apos;s block script that reads FACING A FORMIDABLE PAST.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Those days in Hillfar cross my thoughts every day,&quot; I say. &quot;I thought time would dull them, but I still feel like I&apos;m there right now.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; he says, looking down at his own sheet.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The quest involves going there. And I feel like I have to fully convince myself I&apos;ve left before I go back.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then I&apos;ll be patiently waiting,&quot; he assures me. He reaches to grab my hand. &quot;You&apos;re the strongest person I know.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I tension his hand in mine on a spark of courage. &quot;But I swear to Khiras that I&apos;ll find it in me before this ends. By the end of this season,&quot; I tell him, &quot;I promise you and I will return.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Bertram&apos;s smile creases with the dimples he&apos;s had since he was a child, taking my quest form to return it to the folder. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;And if you can do that, then maybe I can find the courage, too,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;To go there?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;More than that,&quot; he replies. &quot;But it doesn&apos;t matter yet. It seems you&apos;re the one that will have to be brave first.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We leave the challenge at that. Another ten minutes pass before we hear the nurses start to make their morning rounds, so I stuff the two bottles in my rucksack neck-up, along with the thick paper doorstop.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So you&apos;re going on a local quest with double-L, huh?&quot; Bertram asks, reclining back in his bed as he opens an illustrated book about Blackwater. &quot;He must have had his come-to-Khiras moment about you. Or maybe he feels like he&apos;s in trouble.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No&mdash;he just has the first group of friends he&apos;s ever had,&quot; I say. &quot;I want him to enjoy them. Because I know he&apos;ll come back.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;With an apology, I hope,&quot; Bertram says.</p><p>&emsp;I disappear through the door just as the nurse announces his name. The lock clicks in place as I draw my hood, dissolving back between the alleys as morning turns to day.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":54,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":6,"ChapterFull":20,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":54,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":77,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"74","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Jullian and Katiya take part in a mission that brings them back to the old days.

But there are still signs we&apos;ve grown together. And when he takes another pull off his second fill of the canteen, his eyes meet mine, and he doesn&apos;t hesitate to speak his mind.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry because I feel like I&apos;ve gotten carried away,&quot; he says. &quot;Away from all the burdens of the old days: days we spent taking care of our siblings when our moms were working to put food on the table, and now that I have the chance to make my first group of friends, it&apos;s like taking off ankle weights.

I&apos;ve spent my whole life living for others. For my siblings, my family&mdash;almost like a good childhood skipped me&mdash;and I was forced to give it all away to the ones that came after. And now,&quot; he says, &quot;I have this freedom I&apos;ve never had before, and I don&apos;t know what to do with it. And any time I wake up sitting there, just standing still, I feel like I&apos;m spending the last seconds of my youth before I get too old to live it, just full of regret.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you weren&apos;t there,&quot; I tell him. He struggles to look at me, but I can sense the pain of loneliness no different than mine. &quot;Why didn&apos;t you stand up for me, or at least come to visit in the days after the attempt on that noble&apos;s life? Were you . . . ashamed of me?&quot; I remember when he couldn&apos;t even return my gaze when we entered the hall with Bertram. It might have been the first event that precipitated this long spiral.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I had a moment of weakness,&quot; he says. &quot;I should have been there, but every second I wasn&apos;t, this guilt just kept getting greater and greater, until the point that I was afraid of facing you. That you&apos;d think I deserted you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But you did,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;ve been terrified of this moment ever since,&quot; he says. He brushes a strand of stray hair over my ear. His gauntlets grasp the side of my head, tracing his thumb on my cheek. &quot;I&apos;ve always hated this weakness I&apos;ve felt my entire life. This cowardice, of a boy that never made friends, made fun of, and was so scared and unchallenged that he never tried to fly.&quot; He tears up a little. &quot;And I guess I&apos;ve taken for granted the one thing I&apos;ve thought I would always have, supporting me through it all. You,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;The anger and sorrow mix at just a level that I feel them rest at a stalemate. &quot;I want to be there for you, Jullian. But I need you to try, just try, to be there for me. And to stay,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;I tension my arms around his waist, ducking my head beneath his neck as he buries his head into my hair. I mumble something into his chestplate that he doesn&apos;t hear.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I said, this isn&apos;t very comfortable,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;We share a laugh, glancing out across the bustling market: a mosaic of merchants and shoppers browsing and bartering beneath the thin linen.</p><p>&emsp;His mouth curls in a grin after he finds the space to relax again. &quot;You know I love you, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I know that,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just thought about what that guy you were with the other day said, you know.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The &apos;science guy?&apos;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah.

A familiar glare of envy glazes in his eyes. &quot;I think when this is over, we should ditch the armor and&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;A sudden commotion stirs beneath one of the tents when we hear shouts far louder than usual.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;&mdash;I mean, we should ditch the armor and&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Where is that coming from?&quot; I look at today&apos;s vendor map, counting three rows over as an assailant wrangles something from beneath a table.

The panic makes me hold fast to the metal contact: siphoning the friction of the Essence into my circuits in a rejuvenating reversal.</p><p>&emsp;The energy cycles through my body from my arms to my legs, and though my blood freezes with the initial surge of panic, my circuits are scalding with power. The vibrations in the tether rattle the bones in my arms, casting sparks of hot iron, and when I&apos;m close enough to drop and run, I use the force of the fall to dig the toe of my boots between cobblestones. And with all the energy I&apos;ve stored from letting the blood pool in my legs for four hours&mdash;sitting in tight, padded pants&mdash;all I want to do is run.</p><p>&emsp;The stones shift their alignment when my boots break the ground. The assailant runs west, crossing back through the market, and though they&apos;re a few rows over, shrouded in a tattered crimson hood with an Essence Tool beneath their arm, I&apos;m still the closest to catching them.</p><p>&emsp;We weave between crowds at different speeds. While I waste momentum weaving around civilians, they cut straight through them&mdash;but still, they&apos;re uncommonly quick for a human, and it&apos;s when the wind sheds their disguise that I see the cat ears. Long locks of black hair trail behind them, and in the absence of short fur, it means they&apos;re a half-blood, dipping into their gift of Ahkvan Essence to accelerate time around them.</p><p>&emsp;I vault over the table of a turquoise tent where Kine changes hands. Now the thief is right ahead of me, and instead of shouting, I save my breath to run faster. Time dilates ever-so-slightly around them, casting their shaded features in blue, but I wager that their abilities are nothing compared to my compass.</p><p>&emsp;But all my running has prepared me for this. As they break the edge of the market, approaching the thin line of houses separating the industrial district and old Gaffesend Castle, it seems they&apos;re familiar with Gaffesend&apos;s best abandoned places to hide.</p><p>&emsp;Jullian shouts something behind me, straining his voice trying to get me to stop, as several other guards give chase. But as we weave between narrow alleys of the tenement homes, I&apos;m the only one that can see the half-blood thief.</p><p>&emsp;The edge of the district is coming near, where a long wooden fence partitions the district from all the abandoned spaces. The assailant takes their time to amble over the edge with the Essenced artifact, and by the time their feet land on the other side, I charge my Essence enough to directly blast myself straight through the wood, casting charred chips of timber toward the abandoned buildings, knowing I&apos;ll be paying for it later with another domestic quest.</p><p>&emsp;I can see them clearer now that we&apos;re neck-and-neck, and I recognize the tattered cloak looks familiar as it billows behind her. Three steps behind, we approach the old castle shed, separated from the grounds of the Estate. To a layman, it would be a dead end&mdash;but for someone with knowledge of the Royal Guards&mdash;it&apos;s an ancient egress point, and when she enters the small storeroom lined with aged tools from centuries ago, she knows to slip beneath the busted trapdoor to drop down into the ancient tunnels.</p><p>&emsp;If only I had this much adrenaline during the parade, maybe the outcome would be different, because from all the energy coursing through my circuits and veins, I don&apos;t think twice about dropping down into the old escape tunnels. Her boots splash in the murky water, crunching the bones of forgotten skeletons that fought the front lines  five hundred years ago. When I land in the calf-high sludge, I cast a plume of fire that bounces between the walls, lighting the lines of the long earthen tomb until it sizzles in the water, just long enough to see her silhouette shrink down the straightaway.</p><p>&emsp;But I&apos;m not letting her go.</p><p>&emsp;A persistent flame materializes above my head, flickering with the musty air as I trudge-run through the roughly-hewn tunnel. The splashing gets louder as I gain on her, turning right, then left, then left again, as I try to remember the maps from the briefing all those months ago.</p><p>&emsp;My race&apos;s skill with healing means I&apos;m sensitive to others&mdash;and when I attenuate her vitals, I can feel her exhaustion, fighting for breath as we approach what looks like a dead end, only to burst through a door to a stairwell that takes us up into the castle courtyard.</p><p>&emsp;I find the energy to yell. &quot;You&apos;re not getting away from me,&quot; I shout, and when we break the threshold of the courtyard, we find drifters and vagrants making camp with tattered sheets, stoking fires with their meager Essence. She scales the stairs of the main edifice, and I wonder why she gains height when it only means she&apos;s getting further from the ground.</p><p>&emsp;I&apos;m close enough now that I can feel the wind she displaces. She grabs for a steaming pot and launches it at me, casting a spray of boiling soup, but I duck out of the way, regathering my footing as she tries throwing down debris to trip me.</p><p>&emsp;But she wasted too much on the offense. I grab her cloak as we crest the stairs of the old hall, so crumbled from war and the elements that sunlight streams through the ceiling and walls.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Enough,&quot; I shout.</p><p>&emsp;But she tears out a shortsword with her other hand, slicing through the fabric as I stumble. With the Essence Tool still cradled in her arm, she draws her weapon to face me. I drop the scrap of fabric, realizing from touch that it&apos;s a guard cloak.</p><p>&emsp;Her sharp blue eyes catch the trainee insignia on my armor, along with my identifying number. &quot;A replacement,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;We circle around a table. &quot;You stole that cloak from a guard,&quot; I say, as I draw my sword. &quot;Reinforcements are right behind me. You have nowhere to go!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re as disposable as I was,&quot; she says. &quot;Your number. Starting with eighty-four means they have you in the house with the lake view.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How could you know that?&quot; I ask, but I don&apos;t let her mind games shake me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Because your name is coming off that damn key just like mine was, and you&apos;ll have nothing,&quot; she shouts, ripping the table aside as she takes her first swing at me.</p><p>&emsp;We trade blows, fighting in a hall that the old Knights once trained in, clashing our swords with echoes of an ancient past. I remember Derry, the baker, and a name that crests my lips as I try to remember.</p><p>&emsp;Our circling runs me into the edge of a table, and unable to evade, she drives at me with a powerful blow, buffeting me with the Essence Tool. I stumble, nearly dropping my sword as she slices across my breastplate, catching metal instead of flesh.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Aleena,&quot; I say. &quot;Why do you do this?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She pauses for a moment, as if she&apos;d really give an answer. But then she runs for the spiral staircase to the upper floors, and I give chase, just as I hear the other lagging guards approach the hall.</p><p>&emsp;I take two steps at a time, casting sparks as my steel pauldtons scrape the side of the stairwell. I can hear her footfalls directly above me as we get higher and higher and higher, until we reach the very top. </p><p>&emsp;She&apos;s running out of avenues to escape. All that&apos;s left are the buildings of the old industrial district that border the castle, and when we&apos;re four stories up, running across ramparts that look out to a stark cliffside bordering the forest, I doubt she has anywhere to go.</p><p>&emsp;But then she jumps onto a roof of a wooden building in the servants&apos; quarter. She yelps when her foot crashes through the ceiling, withdrawing as I decide to approach from the other side, aiming for the central beam id the frame instead of the eaves.</p><p>&emsp;We&apos;re neck-and-neck as she lumbers with the stolen tool and I struggle with my armor, not quite in grabbing distance when the fall is too much of a consequence. She&apos;s heading for the other side of the castle rampart bordering the industrial warehouses, and when I think I&apos;m about to grab her, she channels all her Essence into accelerating for one final sprint.</p><p>&emsp;My breath tastes like poison when it leaves my lungs. Falling further behind, I watch as she runs directly for the edge of the castle wall, as if to jump to her death. But without hesitation, she clambers onto a straightaway of stone slabs, managing seven strides before she launches herself over the edge.</p><p>&emsp;She vanishes from sight. And I wager she&apos;s planned this all from the start: planning to live and steal another day, so before the hesitation seizes my muscles, I take the same seven steps and launch myself over the edge.</p><p>&emsp;I can feel the turbulence of wind as gravity comes to collect on my four-story climb. Behind me, I hear Jullian cry my name, and beneath me, a yawning gap spans a thousand years of progress between the old castle and the tall industrial building.</p><p>&emsp;We float in the air at the same time, flying like the Auvryan angels of their floating lands. Her Ahkvan reflexes give her just shy of nine lives to land. I hinge my legs in anticipation of crashing into the gravel roof, and after she rolls off her fall, I thrust myself with a plume of flames to break my speed enough to twist myself into a barrel roll.</p><p>&emsp;The roof is small, high, and flat, surrounded by the stark eaves of industrial buildings that are unnavigable. Out of breath, she rushes for the roof access door, only to find it locked, desperately jimmying the round handle as she groans in exasperation.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Drop it,&quot; I tell her.</p><p>&emsp;She complies, placing the artifact on the ground. &quot;As soon as I failed that test, I was always destined to die. So do whatever you have to do with me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I quickly glance to the edge of the castle wall, so much higher than I remember. All the guards descended the stairs, running around to reconvene inside the warehouse. And I make a decision. </p><p>&emsp;I reach past her, tensioning my fingers against the knob as it glows with scalding heat.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What are you doing? But aren&apos;t you going to take me in? I&apos;m a part of the Den Of Thieves now!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You and I aren&apos;t that different. Just separated by time, I fear.&quot; I gesture for the door. &quot;She got away. But she dropped the high-value tool she might have used to aid the enemy.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;A look of shameful relief flushes her face. Sweat mixes with tears she refuses to allow to break the threshold of her eyes. &quot;I never wanted it to end up this way,&quot; she says. &quot;Aren&apos;t you afraid they&apos;ll send you to die? And then what will you do?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I tell her. &quot;But you can choose something else.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She makes for the stairway as I hear a dozen footfalls reach the gravel lot below. Then she hesitates. &quot;There&apos;s something brewing from the East, I hear,&quot; she says. &quot;Melenia&apos;s had a dangerous change in its royalty. And I&apos;ve heard things.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Heard what?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just . . . stay aware,&quot; she says. &quot;Watch the East.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Ans then she disappears past the threshold. My hands clasp the Easence Tool as I give three seconds before I chase her again, but without wares to weigh her down, I find she&apos;s already gone.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":4,"AutoNameFull":56,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":6,"ChapterFull":20,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":4,"SceneFull":56,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":79,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"76","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.20.56","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-52b","Body":"<p>&emsp;&quot;That wasn&apos;t our job!

And I was right. She was asking me a favor, because she volunteered me for something I never asked to do, because she considered me weak enough to fill the role.</p><p>&emsp;And after I strolled around her town to size me for clothes that wouldn&apos;t make me stand out too much, I find myself now standing in an open lot with loads of other townsfolk, arranged in a laughable formation, feeling like I&apos;m at a little-league lacrosse practice if all the dads were swapped out for the kids.</p><p>&emsp;The Royal Guards line the dirt-and-grass lot with sheathed swords. We all face the most important guy, standing at the front as he tries not to laugh at the sorry arrangement of rejects that are only here for the free beer after the event. But at least it&apos;s for a good cause. And she volun-told me in advance early enough that I could take paid time off.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Gentlemen, I&apos;m honored to gather you all here today,&quot; Katiya&apos;s commander says. &quot;Though our guards are powerful and skilled enough to defend all of Gaffesend, this a chance for you to develop the tools to defend yourselves. To feel comfortable and safe.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The only time I remember doing anything like this was at some other kid&apos;s karate party when I was in first grade. And the instructor had to break the balsa wood plank with his own hands, because I was afraid of hurting myself. I look down at the wooden training sword, hoping it&apos;s just an odd prop for one of those weird stretching exercises.</p><p>&emsp;I feel a hand on my shoulder. A stocky man whispers in my ear. &quot;So Katiya roped you into this too, huh? To get her two?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess so,&quot; I say. &quot;My hands are soft: I design stuff all day.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And I&apos;m a baker. Name&apos;s Derry,&quot; he says, and I shake his large, calloused hand without turning around&mdash;too afraid of getting yelled at, though the three rows of husky townies hide me well. &quot;What part of town are you in?&quot; I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen you around.</p><p>&emsp;My nervousness impedes my filter. &quot;I live with Katiya,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;With her?&quot; He asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. No . . . I mean, close to her. Next to her,&quot; I say. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. So what do you do for the military then?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My mind races back on Katiya&apos;s collection of rehearsed lies. &quot;I&apos;m one of the Royal Scientists&apos; protgs, so they wedged me in with the others, doing some research in Gaffesend.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well I don&apos;t blame you for being close to Katiya. If I was thirty years younger, with a body like that, I&apos;d fight a damn war for a woman like her,&quot; he says, reminding me of most of the technicians at my work. But the commander&apos;s voice cuts us off, before Derry can objectify her any further.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Most of you are too, uh . . . &apos;heavy-set&apos; for running, so today will focus on basic, self-defense sword fighting and feats of strength.&quot; I flex and feel for the strength in my arms, hoping my two-a-week workouts give me enough muscle to overpower an Essenced tavern-brawler. He continues: &quot;While our brave, senior soldiers guard the borders of Gaffesend, this is a chance for our trainees to pass on their knowledge.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I look to Katiya, flushed with that same sense of anxiety that seems like her factory setting. She musters a smile when we meet eyes, standing next to her beanpole boyfriend with their swords drawn, and as Aldrin rambles on about the value of self-defense like a first-amendment technician at my work, I twirl the wooden training sword in the dirt.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So we&apos;ll start with basic technique. I&apos;m sure most of you have at least been trained a little &mdash; maybe by a family member or something.&quot; I remember playing defense in Lacrosse, jabbing breastplates with the basket end of my stick, and that&apos;s about it: besides shooting clays with my godfather in the FBI &mdash; but that&apos;s at least a hundred years away for these people.</p><p>&emsp;He shows us a basic downward swing before instructing us to stand further apart. I try a couple swings like all the others, without a single idea of what I&apos;m doing, and when the other cadets start to approach, I catch Katiya laughing at me.</p><p>&emsp;I flip her the bird, hoping sign language crosses our understandings: catching a glare from Jullian as he approaches to help his own two volunteers.</p><p>&emsp;Katiya says, &quot;The point is to swing through something. Don&apos;t stop short!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But there&apos;s nothing to swing at,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then swing at me,&quot; she says. I recall my father&apos;s words about hitting a girl. And then she adds: &quot;You&apos;ve already done it once before, haven&apos;t you? So what&apos;s the difference?&quot; Her lips peel into a mischievous smile, ready to hurl as many insults as it takes for me to go all out.</p><p>&emsp;Derry hands Katiya his wooden sword to add some fuel. &quot;She&apos;s one of the tough ones. I bet you won&apos;t last a minute.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;And with enough pressure, I chance a light swing at her. She slashes with half her power, nearly knocking the training sword out of my hands.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ve seen toddlers with less hesitation,&quot; she says. She swings the sword a couple times to draw the attention of other townies, adding pressure for me to defend my manhood. They turn their heads. &quot;Come on: do your worst, Cody of Denver!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I white-knuckle the hilt of the sword like a baseball bat, taking a hard swing from the side. Katiya hardly twists her sword, and my blade glides up the polished flat surface.</p><p>&emsp;My momentum shifts entirely upright as I continue to spin, so committed to the strike that the training blade launches out of my hands. It travels point-first as it spins in the air like a surface-to-air missile with guards for fins, launching towards the commander as he recognizes all the turning faces.</p><p>&emsp;My muscles crumple faster than my soul as I watch Katiya&apos;s face change from humor to horror. Aldrin raises his arm in an instant, catching the smooth edge with a single hand. The edgeless blade slides for its full length before stopping at the hilt, the dull point halted inches from his face.</p><p>&emsp;He looks around at all the startled townsfolk, astounded at how quickly this training session descended into disarray. Once he traces the trajectory, the scarred commander stares daggers at me as he approaches from the center of the field. Dealing with my varsity coach was hard enough when I whipped that hard rubber lacrosse ball past his head: I&apos;ve never pissed off a warrior like him.</p><p>&emsp;He doesn&apos;t even have to open his mouth before I&apos;m off in apologetics. He draws the sword so it points directly at my chest.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I, uh, do numbers and stuff. I&apos;m not any kind of warrior,&quot; I insist.</p><p>&emsp;But Katiya cuts in. &quot;It was my fault, Chief. I egged him on by insulting him a little. I wanted to see him angry.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I think he&apos;s going to skewer me and roast my flesh over a spit, but he flips the blade around in his hands so that the hilt faces me. &quot;What&apos;s your name, son?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The townsfolk look on with secondhand shame. Aldrin turns to around to shoo their focus away, and by the time I answer, they&apos;ve all returned to practicing techniques.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Cody. Well, you have the passion,&quot; he says. &quot;And a strong arm. But you need to channel that into technique.&quot; He gestures to Katiya for her wooden sword. &quot;Is it alright if I borrow your volunteer?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Katiya nods.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The most important thing in sword fighting is balance, Mister Cody,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;You put all your power into a single swing &mdash; but what were you planning to do after?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I stammer as the weight of the sword in my hands becomes awkward. &quot;I . . . I&apos;m not sure,&quot; I say, &quot;sir.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t be ashamed, son. You&apos;ve done the Gods&apos; work coming out today as a volunteer, and I&apos;m grateful you&apos;re here. But Miss Katiya, here, is a true professional.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;And it feels like a lion training a chihuahua.</p><p>&emsp;Aldrin turns to Katiya. &quot;Why don&apos;t you show Mr. Cody a standard forward strike?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We stand aside. Katiya balances her feet so that her non-dominant foot is in front, with her hips facing forward. The steel sword slides out of her sheath with an iconic ring.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And, see, her goal is to close the gap between herself and the enemy with the blade,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;But notice there, how she steps away slightly?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say, transfixed at her training. She slashes forward with a perfect overhead swing, but steps slightly to the side with her dominant foot.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And why don&apos;t you explain how this ties into balance, Katiya?&quot; Aldrin asks.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The line of action goes directly at the enemy. But I step aside, in case there&apos;s a counterattack. It lets you keep your balance,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;Aldrin claps me on the back, handing me the training sword. &quot;Why don&apos;t you give it a shot?&quot; He asks.</p><p>&emsp;I draw my left foot forward, as if I&apos;m beaming a lacrosse ball across the field for a breakaway. But I get confused with my footing.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Why don&apos;t you practice with him, Katiya? Hold the sword with him.&quot; But then her face flushes. &quot;Don&apos;t be embarrassed. Mister Dunsmore needs to learn,&quot; he says, smiling as he withdraws.</p><p>&emsp;Katiya hesitantly approaches from behind me. I feel the cold steel of her breastplate press against my back as she reaches her gauntlets to grasp my hands, and I refuse to even try looking at Jullian. Her steel boots align with my feet as I stand off-foot-forward, and as I slice down with the wooden sword, her hips press into mine, guiding my legs to swing in rhythm with the sword, and I end up to the side of that perfect line of action.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Don&apos;t get used to it,&quot; she whispers in my ear, and I swear I can feel the heat radiate off her face.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Very good,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;Now give me a hundred of those: now!&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I tense in tonal panic, locked with the sword in its last position. </p><p>&emsp;Aldrin laughs. &quot;Sorry. Force of habit. Do, uh . . . twenty or something, yeah?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sir, yes sir,&quot; I say, as if I&apos;m a pledge in the fraternity again.</p><p>&emsp;I take a couple practice swings, mirroring Katiya&apos;s technique as best as I can. And as Derry steps to the side&mdash;relieved he doesn&apos;t have to leverage his husky frame for sword practice, ever closer to the free ale on the other side of the session, Katiya takes at least ten minutes before she can turn and face me again.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":58,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":7,"ChapterFull":21,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":58,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":82,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"Paragate, Cody","UUID":"79","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Katiya laughs at how Cody fails miserably.","VerboseID":"3.21.58","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-54","Body":"<p>&emsp; &quot;If you&apos;re on the line right now, you don&apos;t mind the chance of getting hurt,&quot; Aldrin says. His eyes scan the thirsty townies standing behind the line of rope. &quot;Just because you don&apos;t get to drink first if you don&apos;t do the course does NOT mean you won&apos;t drink at all.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But all the fucking ale will be gone!&quot; One of the beer-gutted strongmen says. Even the hesitant men now join the line, shouting in agreement.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, it&apos;s not a race: it&apos;s a course,&quot; Aldrin says. &quot;And you need to help each other.&quot; He gestures around the standard training course used by the Royal Guards, bent in a U-shape that ends with kegs and kegs of booze. Some men look like they&apos;re about to cut the whole damn course, but the senior guards are back &mdash; and Aldrin set them up so no one can cut the others. I can&apos;t see the course behind the backs of the tall and muscular farmers and their field hands. I&apos;ll have to play it entirely by ear.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Your trainees are depending on you to win, because they don&apos;t drink until your whole team does. So they&apos;ll be cheering you on, all along the way,&quot; Aldrin says.</p><p>&emsp;I can feel the adrenaline coarse through my veins, but mostly from the fear of getting crushed or stepped on. </p><p>&emsp;Derry&apos;s hand rests on my shoulder. &quot;You&apos;re a young fella, and fast, I bet. You&apos;ll be able to shoot right through there!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;If they let me,&quot; I tell him.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll make them,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;Aldrin counts down. Even for a fun run, I can feel the pressure mount on me as Katiya watches&mdash;and every time we meet eyes, I feel the urge build to impress her.</p><p>&emsp;He holds an archaic gun into the air. I hold my breath, waiting for the blast like it&apos;s winter track season all over again. I stagger my feet and let my fingers soak into the cold, wet soil, and just as I&apos;m about to anticipate the blast, I feel Derry&apos;s hands grasp my back.</p><p>&emsp;The gun blast echoes between the mountains. Derry pushes me with all his strength, and suddenly I stagger into first: sliding a quarter-distance of the mud pit beneath the barbed wire.</p><p>&emsp;I was a three-sport athlete, and I immediately think back to football season in the fall, when snow still saturated the frozen ground, and I&apos;m lighter than I was then when I wore pads and a helmet. Lighter than the ones before me, my elbows thrash the ground as mud splashes in my face, peerless in the moment, absorbed in the cheers that crescendo with my name.</p><p>&emsp;My old-world shirt is soaked in heavy mud, and I&apos;m drenched down to the Under Armor compression shirt, but I feel that rare window of joy seize my body in its entirety, and I&apos;m thankful my emotional curse doesn&apos;t eclipse my enjoyment of the moment. I hear the sloshing and clambering of men that look like Vikings, grunting and growling with their lust of liquor.</p><p>&emsp;I rise at the end of the mud crawl, glancing back to find my teammate Derry not far behind: his wife cheering him on from the sidelines. I hear Katiya shout my name, and turn to face the next obstacle: a tall climbing wall with several ropes hanging from the top. I&apos;m not as light as I was after a whole four years of shotgunning beers in the fraternity, but it feels as if I have circuits like Katiya, from all the energy that floods my veins.</p><p>&emsp;My hands grasp the ragged weave of rope, tucking it beneath my arm as I take the first steps up the wall. The eyes are all on me now as I compensate for my previous failure. My arms grab hand-over-hand as the mud-soaked townies clamber like zombies, with groans that lust for liquor instead of brains, shaking the rope as they grasp it themselves, destabilizing my footing on the wall.</p><p>&emsp;But I tighten my hands on the rope. Past halfway, I find it stretches less, advantaged by the boost from Derry that left the rope loose for much of my ascent. And as I approach the top, I feel my stomach drop when I look at the other side.</p><p>&emsp;I thought it was another rope down. But instead, I find three logs spanning a two-story-high stretch from one tower to another: the bottom filled with murky, freezing water of an unknown depth. The adrenaline outpaces the panic as the crowd of knights and supporters shifts up to watch as I take my first steps on the log: tempted to hug and hump my way across, but I take a deep breath and take my time.</p><p>&emsp;So far down, Katiya and Jullian stand beside each other, along with Pax and Ryder and the catgirl Naya and a pale-looking Bertram that shakes his fist.</p><p>&emsp;I scrape my muddy feet before I proceed: still a ways ahead of the others, and I take my time stepping across&mdash;like an alcoholic walking a line to show an officer that he can drive.</p><p>&emsp;But I catch an odd footing. Panic seizes my chest when the elevation imposes itself, and I fall to my chest as the crowd groans in anticipation. But I hear their cheers still coming strong: Pax chanting &quot;Science Guy&quot; in their tongue until the others join, and they cheer when I regain my footing, stumbling slowly before I make it to the other side.</p><p>&emsp;Next is a span of sixteen-or-so bars dangling over the same sickening drop. I doubt my adrenaline will last if I don&apos;t keep going: un-Essenced like the others and at a certain disadvantage.</p><p>&emsp;But I continue: taking the first suspended bar in my hands as my feet decide whether they want to leave the safety of the platform, making the mistake of looking down and noticing patches of grass I HOPE are just floating, and not islands that would break my legs.</p><p>&emsp;But the excitement is too great. My exhilarated mind flashes back to the breakaways of all those lacrosse games I miss so damn much with Miguel&mdash;and lost in the emotional rhyme, I realize I&apos;m already halfway across, steadily swinging between rails until I make it to the other side.</p><p>&emsp;I turn back to find Derry waving at the other side, making some gesture I interpret as a &quot;thumbs-up&quot; as he waits to cross, using his meager townie Essence to strengthen his grasp before it&apos;s his turn to cross the bars.</p><p>&emsp;The end of the towers is a series of vertical ropes. And as the others gain on me with their powerful arms, swinging like silverback gorillas, I slide down the rope after saturating my hands in the cool mud caked on my undershirt, regaining my footing as I make it to the bottom.</p><p>&emsp;I reach the end of the &apos;U&apos;-shape to find the joining section as a simple sprint before more low-level towers at ground height, and I take off for the next side, watching as the Essenced knights double my speed to get a spot on the other side.</p><p>&emsp;I feel a presence behind me. One of Jullian&apos;s non-guard buddies I recognize from before uses his advantage to sprint faster, and he&apos;s several breaths behind me as we round the last turn of the U-shape, coming to a near stop as we approach a bunch of logs that protrude from a gravel pit: a series of one-footed jumps that focus on technique over strength.</p><p>&emsp;Half cheer my name. But half cheer for my adversary, named Delvin. We balance the desire for speed over the failure of the fall, wagering the swiftness of every jump. And as we&apos;re neck-and-neck, I decide to dash the rest of the logs, back in first as I make it to the last challenge.</p><p>&emsp;All that&apos;s left is one last straightaway with hurdles. It was my event in track when I was lighter, and had a six-pack on my body instead of in my hand every weekend. But the muscle memory is there, and as I take lane two of six, my rival takes four as we sprint with all we have, letting the fanfare flood our muscles where our exasperated breath falls short.</p><p>&emsp;My steps reach a rhythm like I&apos;m sprinting down the hundred-meter span of hurdles on my high school track: over the long logs in seven steps and a leap, seven steps and a leap, seven steps and a leap.</p><p>&emsp;The goal is getting closer, stacked with kegs. The beautiful town ladies are tensioned with corsets that rise their breasts as a beckoning call to the grizzly men behind us, raising mugs of fresh ale as sirens that call their lascivious warriors to come.</p><p>&emsp;A leap and seven steps. A leap and seven steps. And I see Katiya at the finish, smiling ear-to-ear as her boyfriend stands next to her, cheering on Delvin. And I&apos;m so close now, about to place first, when I hear a pained groan and a loud exhale as Delvin crumples into the second-to-last log hurdle.</p><p>&emsp;And I stop in my tracks, inches from the finish. I look behind me to find Delvin grasping his chest without wind as the horde of others is quickly approaching.</p><p>&emsp;But I decide to turn around as I huff for breath, climbing over the log to approach my rival, offering him a hand so he can rise from the sullen ground.</p><p>&emsp;I take his arm across my shoulders. A few racers sprint past us, transfixed by the boobs and ale ahead of them. And as we stumble over the logs in steps instead of leaps, I feel Delvin&apos;s weight shift when Derry grabs his other arm.</p><p>&emsp;We finish twelfth-or-so. Katiya and all her friends congratulate the three of us when we cross. The air stinks of salty sweat, but the ale is sweet and savory as we chug the carbonated brew like cold water.</p><p>&emsp;We hang around for a while until Aldrin presents an award to first place, and though he recognizes my efforts, he presents it to another lean, younger man that passed us while we carried Delvin. Katiya and a few friends watch my face as I react to this loss, and though Delvin is distraught, I laugh and cheer as the winner holds his makeshift trophy in the air.</p><p>&emsp;I find an emotion in Katiya&apos;s face that I&apos;ve never seen before. She looks away when I return her glance. Her other friends chatter on about how I deserve the title, and even Jullian offers me words of encouragement, thanking me for aiding his friend.</p><p>&emsp;A long day ends with us walking home. I say I left my stuff at Katiya&apos;s so we could all walk together, and when they&apos;re all distracted, I slip inside and disappear through the door&mdash;quick to feel the bliss of a hot shower.</p><p>&emsp;After toweling off, I head downstairs to grab a glass of water in my boxers. I hear Jullian and Katiya heading upstairs on their side of the dimensional wall. Katiya whispers something to Jullian as he continues to climb the stairs, and after she takes off her heavy boots, I hear her footfalls as she approaches my door.</p><p>&emsp;She knocks with a knuckle. I&apos;m quick to answer on the other side, peeking out no more than my head and a shoulder.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey &mdash; thanks for doing this today,&quot; she whispers. &quot;You surely didn&apos;t start off so well, but you ended in a blaze.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; I tell her. &quot;It was worth the PTO.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;She turns to close the door, but then hesitates for a moment: something still on her mind that she&apos;s tempted to ask. &quot;But at the end there . . . you were surely going to win,&quot; she says. &quot;Why did you give Delvin a hand before you crossed?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;She looks up with anticipation, as if she disbelieves the face I wore when they were handing out awards. But something makes her want to hear me say it: to convince her of something.</p><p>&emsp;And so I tell her the truth.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just didn&apos;t think the ale would taste any different,&quot; I whisper. &quot;You know?&quot;</p>"},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"50","GivenName":"Warrior Business","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Eight","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Twenty-Two","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":8,"ChapterFull":22,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":83,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"First Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"80","Synopsis":"Katiya attends Cody&apos;s work&apos;s open house.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.22","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"06/15/26","FantasyTime":"2A-128, 14th of Suntide","StoryDay":"Monday","Setting":"Hearthland Ridge Estates"},"DocName":"20* // &quot;Warrior Business&quot;","Body":"About a month passes since the self-defense festival. After a memorable day of ale and laughter where the knights and their civilian counterparts celebrate late into the night, the spirit of the town of Gaffesend settles back into the air of nervous unease. The sounds of cheer no longer make the noise of the distant war machine, wondering every moonless night whether it&apos;s getting closer or further, and though my stomach rises again with the terror of the unknown, I find a strange respite when I remember Cody&apos;s warless world is right next door.But I hate it.So often my mind races through scenarios &mdash; whether it&apos;s a fire, a siege, or a shelling of amethyst mortars &mdash; wondering how I&apos;ll react when it happens, if I might flee to that pacifistic realm of peace, and what it would take to withstand a moment of weakness like that.But it&apos;s so enthralling that it captures my mind, when I&apos;m away on my quests in the town. It&apos;s been weeks since I chased the half-blood Ahkva: the few guards that witnessed the leap have already forgotten my act of courage, and all that remains is the memory of my failure to defend the nobles.But today is different. Though Cody and I no longer lock our doors, saying hello when we return from long days working in our worlds, he&apos;s invited me to an event at his place of employment, and at week&apos;s end, I have the entire day off.He peeks through the doorway, gesturing to the outfit I assembled on minimum knowledge. &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;&quot;You said pants. And I&apos;m wearing the shirt you gave me,&quot; I say. He glares at me. &quot;What? All I have from your world is this shirt.&quot;&quot;A surf shirt . . . that you&apos;re going to wear to a formal event?&quot; He asks. &quot;I knew you grew up in the sticks, but don&apos;t you have anything that&apos;s at least a little nice?&quot;&quot;It&apos;s not my fault I wear the armor to everything: I could only bring a hundred pounds of possessions with me. The military curated my whole closet!&quot;&quot;Then&mdash;&quot; Cody checks his watch. He sighs. &quot;I&apos;ve got something else for you, then.&quot;Cody races up the stairs. As I step into his realm, I hear the clatter of hangers in his closet as he looks for the perfect shirt.He returns with a finely-woven collared shirt embellished with the letters NAVIDSON-MONROE ENGINEERING DEPT. over the heart. &quot;I won this in a raffle for New Years last year. All the shirts were just leftovers from the storeroom, and this was a medium.&quot; He hands it to me. &quot;Can you imagine that? Billion dollar company that makes its employees pay for logoed shirts. And yours are all free.&quot;I take it from him. &quot;I pay my giving my damn life, and letting them own me for years,&quot; I say.&quot;Oh,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s a good point, I guess.&quot;I use Cody&apos;s restroom to change into the shirt. I can hear his nervous impatience as he taps his nails against the kitchen counter, and when I look in the mirror, I can&apos;t even recognize myself, looking so much like a civilian from his world.He judges me when I open the door. His face twists into a light sneer.&quot;What? I look just like one of your people.&quot;&quot;I mean, besides the eyes&mdash;&quot;&quot;You can&apos;t change my eyes,&quot; I say.&quot;I know,&quot; he says. &quot;But the pants. Don&apos;t you just have, like, a pair of jeans or something?&quot;&quot;Jeans? This is all I have,&quot; I say.&quot;Okay,&quot; he says. He opens his mouth as if he wants to continue, but he stops.&quot;No, what?&quot; I ask.&quot;Uh , nothing,&quot; he says.&quot;No, what were you going to say?&quot;&quot;I was just thinking . . . I should take you shopping, you know. If you&apos;re going to be spending more time in my world.&quot;&quot;But I don&apos;t have any dollars,&quot; I say.&quot;It&apos;s okay. I do,&quot; he says.&quot;But what about your debt?&quot;&quot;The mortgage? I&apos;m doing fine. As long as I don&apos;t get fired,&quot; he says. &quot;How about you take me shopping in your world?&quot;He peeks into my home to find I&apos;m wearing the only clothes I&apos;ve been given from his world. It&apos;s just the surf shirt: washed, of course, along with the finely-woven pants of my knight&apos;s uniform, traced down the front of the knee in a line of gold, with more pockets than any other piece of clothing I have."},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":1,"AutoNameFull":59,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":8,"ChapterFull":22,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":1,"SceneFull":59,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":84,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"81","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Cody takes Katiya into work for an open house.

You still look like you were ripped out of the high Middle Ages.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;I have no idea what he means. &quot;But it&apos;s a shirt with a collar, right?&quot; I ask. &quot;I don&apos;t have the fancy noble clothes from your world. This was woven by hand!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And it looks like you&apos;re off to add your name to the Drclaration Of Independence,&quot; he says. Cody cracks a smile as he slips his feet onto a pair of his work shoes, wearing what he calls a weekend-formal shirt with stretchy fabric and a sharp collar.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Are you really sure you want me to go, then? All you&apos;ve done is insult me since I showed you the only other outfit I have,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;m dressed by the guard. They only let me take a hundred pounds of personal items when I came here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It shows,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;I sneer at him. &quot;Are you done?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He rises to his feet, taking one last glance at the odd texture of my shirt: thin in some areas, and mildly frayed from wearing it beneath my armor.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Not yet. Give me a second,&quot; he says, retreating back upstairs to rustle through his cupboard. Half a minute later, he returns with another nice shirt. It&apos;s stitched with the letters NAVIDSON-MONROE: evidently woven by one of the fancy machines of his world.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m going to fill a whole closet from you at this rate,&quot; I say, hesitant to take another garment.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s been like a month since the last time I gave you that shirt,&quot; he says. &quot;And we still haven&apos;t even properly shopped for you yet. I got this in a New Years raffle from my company when they were trying to empty out the old employee storeroom. It&apos;s a women&apos;s medium, and I don&apos;t have the body for it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He extends his hand though the doorway. I crack the door shut to quickly change, trading the bright, uneven stitch-work for a smooth, silken, short-sleeve polo, surprised by how little I feel of the texture &mdash; and in moments like these, it makes me hesitant to indulge any further in even the simplest of his world&apos;s conveniences.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well?&quot; He asks. I crack the door open again as he takes his work passport into his pocket. His eyes glow with a certain sarcastic pride. &quot;You look like a new intern. Just don&apos;t ask the guys for any questions on your projects, or they&apos;ll never leave you alone.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I get the impression it&apos;s some backhanded compliment. &quot;I&apos;ll be quiet unless talked to.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, not this time,&quot; he says. &quot;The whole point is to interact with people! You get to meet my team: it&apos;s an open house. The world left behind keeping women quiet a while ago.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Okay. And...&quot; I gesture to my boots: the last oddity we haven&apos;t discussed. It&apos;s the casual pair, emblazoned with the faintest trace of metal around the toe and heel. &quot;Are these really okay?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just means you can go on the floor, if you&apos;re wearing steel toes like that.&quot; Cody gestures for me to enter his car port. &quot;You look fine. We should really get moving, or else they&apos;ll eat all the pizza before we can even get there.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He cracks the door to the car port, and the solid steel gate slides along the rails. It&apos;s been more than a month since my first and last adventure in his car, and I feel ready to withstand all the twists and turns.</p><p>&emsp;I gently feather the car door open and sit in the seat. My body feels so light and free without the weight of the armor, as if I&apos;m wearing nothing at all, and after he pulls out of the car room into the street, the gate closes behind us.</p><p>&emsp;We take a different route this time, driving straight instead of turning left. It&apos;s been about a month since the self-defense training program, and with all that time passed in forgettable engagements, we share a couple stories from our lives.</p><p>&emsp;I describe how fast the town of Gaffesend transitions from festive joy to dreadful unease. I talk about the letters from my family back home, and how proud they say they are of my brother and I &mdash; though I&apos;m glad they aren&apos;t around to see what the other townsfolk think. I tell him how my mistake still overshadows me, and that I&apos;m glad they&apos;ve forgotten my foolish leap between buildings, and how I&apos;ve returned to prowling the streets.</p><p>&emsp;He tells me about work, but doesn&apos;t say much: just that he&apos;s nervous about being let go, and that he&apos;s developing something &quot;stupid&quot; that might make or break his career. I&apos;m entranced by the unfamiliar foliage that whips past us, pretending we&apos;re driving on the backroads between Gaffesend and the capital, surprised at how open Cody&apos;s world actually is when you get away from all the tall buildings.</p><p>&emsp;I ask him about Kei: he says not much has changed. He asks me about Jullian, and I say not much has changed, either: still middling in our relationship.</p><p>&emsp;His eyes glaze over with an unfamiliar joy when we wind the switchbacks, taking the turns with a certain passion, and though we&apos;re taking his daily passage to work, I doubt it&apos;s related to his employment.</p><p>&emsp;We pull up to the gates an hour after midday to find them open. The armor-less guard waves us through, and we come to a stop in a large dirt lot.</p><p>&emsp;Cody looks at me before we exit, as if to say something, but then his face falls. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Damn it,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He rifles through the center cupboard on his car, pulling out a cheap pair of dark glasses with letters on the side. &quot;Here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;For what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I forgot about your eyes,&quot; he says. &quot;I just got so used to them from looking in them all the time.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My face flushes. &quot;Are you&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No . . . no! Not at all. Calm down,&quot; he says, covering his face with a nicer pair of glasses as he gestures for me to exit. I CAREFULLY open the door, so I don&apos;t hit the vehicle next to me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You keep disguising glasses on you?&quot; I ask. &quot;When would you need them?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;They protect your eyes from the sun, dummy,&quot; he says, overcompensating for his accidental pick-up line. I feel my nerves rise as we approach the massive building, shaded like night as I look through the lenses, my body masked behind Cody as a nervous shadow.</p><p>&emsp;An unfamiliar voice calls to him as we approach his colleagues. &quot;So you finally made it to your first work event,&quot; the lady says. &quot;Even I made it to one before you!&quot; Her face changes when she sees me step out from behind Cody, reminding me a little bit of Jullian. &quot;And who is this you brought?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;This is Katiya. A neighbor of mine,&quot; Cody says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; I say, speaking seamlessly in Cody&apos;s tongue.</p>&quot;And I&apos;m Kei,&quot; she says, shaking my hand gently. &quot;Kei Sakurashima.&quot;"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":60,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":8,"ChapterFull":22,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":60,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":85,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"82","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Cody enthusiastically explains things while Katiya is baffled by science.","VerboseID":"3.22.60","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-58","Body":"<p>&emsp;The installation looks like one of those dug-in shelters on the border of the Purgatory Line, and when we enter the quaint area dug into the side of the mountain, facing the set of reflective steel doors, I expect they&apos;ll open to a grand chamber beneath the ground.</p><p>&emsp;But when Cody&apos;s paramour presses the glowing arrow button, the doors slide open with a chime, exposing a tiny room that the three of us enter. The metal doors are just about to close when a fourth guy shows up, sticking his hands directly into the metal jaws to keep them open.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s a young man with the same aesthetic as Cody, except he has beach-blonde hair and a much more energized personality. He stares at me with his hazel eyes. &quot;Ha! Looks like I made it just in time,&quot; he says. &quot;Cody, my man, and Kei. And who are you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;His conversational flow throws me off guard, stammering for words, but he speaks again.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m Reed.

Ever since he joined that fraternity, he became a fish!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I ask, &quot;A fish? As in...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody cuts the silence with a laugh. &quot;Very funny. We thought we&apos;d pregame this little mixer to make it go faster, you know?&quot; And then he takes me aside, muttering to me under the tone of his breath. &quot;You can take the shades off now.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But my eyes,&quot; I whisper. &quot;Won&apos;t they think I&apos;m weird?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s fine. Remember the lie I gave you?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Caused-play,&quot; I say. &quot;But shouldn&apos;t I at least know what caused this?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody creases his brow with his fingers in disappointment as the man called Reed continues.  &quot;Well, hey, quite a coincidence you work at Navidson-Monroe too, huh?&quot; He asks, pointing to my shirt. It says ENGINEERING TEAM beneath it. &quot;So are you, like, a purchaser or something? Or are you on the Aerospace team? I don&apos;t see you in the main office,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;I stammer over a response, watching Cody prevent his face from changing shades of red when he realizes he&apos;s trapped himself again. &quot;It was that shirt I won in the raffle that didn&apos;t fit me,&quot; he says, &quot;and I decided to give it to her.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Kei laughs. &quot;You don&apos;t have to explain,&quot; she says, catching contagion of Cody&apos;s secondhand embarrassment. &quot;Unless you&apos;re dating or something. But even then, you know. You wouldn&apos;t have to...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We&apos;re not,&quot; Cody insists, turning his eyes down as Reed masterfully switches subjects.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well then I hope it will be a better raffle this year. My dad said they were just emptying out the corporate closet of shirts before the moths could get to them. And all those mugs and pencils and flash drives they were handing out at the job fairs,&quot; Reed says. His piercing eyes meet mine. &quot;Say, Katiya: where do you work if you don&apos;t work here?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. I work in, uh, military.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody elbows me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The military?&quot; Reed smiles. &quot;Nice, Just like my cousin. Well, thank you for your service. What branch? Are you at the Air Force base up north or something?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m in the mountains,&quot; I say, unsure how much further I&apos;m digging myself, wondering if I could ever be ready enough for Cody to bring me anywhere.</p><p>&emsp;Cody interjects, &quot;She&apos;s stationed up near Grand Lake, working on some topographical research, for uh, NOAA.&quot; He glares at me, but in a humored way. &quot;Guess we shouldn&apos;t have pre-gamed so hard, huh? I told you to start clear.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, you two seem pretty close,&quot; Kei says. &quot;Reed and I had to cheat, making each other our plus one.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cody opens his mouth to speak, but then the doors open, just as he ushers the words: &quot;So you guys...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;The carriage lets out to a breathtaking atrium with a curved glass ceiling, surrounded on both sides by stairs and private walled rooms. The chatter is almost deafening from the volume of well-dressed people &mdash; like a royal ball &mdash; and when I look up to the sky, I find a full view of the mountainside through the ceiling glass.</p><p>&emsp;But a lady is poised at the top, standing there with her husband that almost looks like one of our farmers from his brawny arms. As she approaches, exposing a name tag that says KIMBERLY (KIM), I find a reticence suddenly take over Cody, even though it&apos;s too late.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Kei! Oh, hey, so good to see you,&quot; she says, smiling with dimples from ear-to-ear. &quot;And there&apos;s my son. Won&apos;t you say hello?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hey, Mom,&quot; Cody says. &quot;And Dad,&quot; as he approaches.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, don&apos;t look so surprised. Both my boys work here,&quot; Cody&apos;s mother says. &quot;I swear. The last time I saw you two cuties dressed up together was Junior Prom. And that&apos;s before you vanished into our basement all night, to&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Cost lunges between Kei and Reed. &quot;Whoa, whoa, already too far, Mom,&quot; he says, redder than a tomato.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh.

He brought a neighbor-friend.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;They turn their faces to me. And after they look me up and down, I almost gleam a sense of pride lighting their faces again.</p><p>&emsp;I extend my hand. &quot;It&apos;s truly an honor to make your acquaintance,&quot; I say. &quot;Your son and I live next door to each other.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well isn&apos;t he a lucky son of a gun?&quot; Alan says, and I feel the urge to drag Cody away before his redness turns to blue. Reed begins to introduce himself to Kim with Kei as Alan gestures for us to keep walking. &quot;Well, don&apos;t let an old chunk of coal like me hold you kids up. It&apos;s nice to meet ya.&quot; He gives me a firm handshake. I tension my hand a little harder than usual.  &quot;And sweet Jesus, she&apos;s got a grip!&quot; He turns to his progeny. Some surly thought skips the queue in his mind. &quot;Son, you know what they say about strong wrists in a woman&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say, &quot;nice to meet you.&quot; I take Cody&apos;s hand to rush him to the water table, pulsing some healing Essence into him so he might not pass out, but he seems fine. I barricade us both with a group of young trainees from a local seminary, led around by their instructor.</p><p>&emsp;He scans the table until he finds something harder, flashing his badge so they give him a painted can. After a crack and several guzzles later, his soul returns. &quot;Thanks for saving me, there,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s kind of my job,&quot; I tell him. Then I grin. &quot;So is that what you brought me here for? A piece of arm candy to get your love interest off that other guy&apos;s arm?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It would make sense,&quot; he says, fisting a second cup of water. &quot;But no.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then why?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;ll tell you later,&quot; he says. &quot;But how about we look around?&quot;</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":3,"AutoNameFull":61,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":8,"ChapterFull":22,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":61,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":86,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"83","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Cody shows Katiya around the ","VerboseID":"3.22.61","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-59","Body":"<p>&emsp;I spend the rest of the day in Cody&apos;s shadow, avoiding long conversations with his coworkers and eating as much of the free food as we can. And after watching as many of the children&apos;s science demonstrations as possible &mdash; while Cody eagerly riffed on about all these concepts named after scientists &mdash; we take a break on the east balcony that opposes the view from the elevator, looking out across his world&apos;s well-developed landscape.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But it&apos;s fluids,&quot; I say. &quot;You say you&apos;re studying fluids when you study aeroplanes. But fluid is water, not air.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Air has a lot of the same properties of fluids, so we call it fluids,&quot; he says. Then he mentions several scientists from his world as if name-dropping will support his argument. Bernoulli. Lagrange. Some guy he says is an oiler, which sounds like he deals with fluids, only supporting me further.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s Euler,&quot; he says, beginning to gesture with hands that only hurt his explanation. &quot;So there&apos;s streamlines, like this,&quot; he gestures, &quot;that you look at,&quot; he gestures, &quot;you know,&quot; he gestures again, &quot;and then there&apos;s streaklines. And you can look at it through the LaGrangian form that emphasizes states of a moving frame of reference, but the Euler form is for a control volume FIXED instead of moving, and in Aerospace, which is what I want to get into, I find that . . .&quot;</p><p>&emsp;There&apos;s something entrancing about his passion when he rattles on about concepts I can&apos;t hope to understand. I find such a radiant light when I meet eyes with his, and he thinks he&apos;s explaining it clearly.</p><p>&emsp;I nod my head as I turn to gaze out across the landscape, still bright with early-morning sun, trying to wrap my head around the fact that this whole landmass is safe from ocean to ocean. And with no clear lines partitioning them, the buildings grow like weeds without the culling force of constant conflict.</p><p>&emsp;&quot; . . . So Bernoulli says the pressure difference pushes up on the wing,&quot; he says, spouting more names and using his Navidson-Monroe water bottle now as a prop. I forget to nod. &quot;And now I realize you have no idea what I&apos;m talking about.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I smile. &quot;But your enthusiasm is refreshing. Pray tell: do you know how many people have the emotional resources to be passionate like you where I live?&quot; I say. &quot;Your people focus on designing planes and big machines. All our people have to think about is what&apos;s moving around in the dark.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That&apos;s why you should come over more,&quot; Cody says. &quot;You might have scared me at first, but I like spending time with you now.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I adjust my sweaty hand on the hot steel railing, unaware I&apos;m sliding closer to his. &quot;You aren&apos;t too bad either,&quot; I say. We touch with a spark, then withdraw our hands. &quot;A good friend. I&apos;m just afraid of getting comfortable with all of this.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Understandable,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;I put on the sun glasses instead of squinting my eyes, and Cody points out landmarks. A cluster of red rocks in the shape of an amphitheatre. His parents&apos; house in Hearthland Ridge. And our house &mdash; I mean, his house, across the lake, muddled in a cluster of homes.</p><p>&emsp;We step inside to tour the last section we haven&apos;t seen yet: the Engineering showroom, with models of all the famous planes like the Flawless Diamond and the SR-71. Cody continues his ramblings, dumbing them down a little further as I look at him with a refreshing sense of admiration. He talks in my language of war: about the big bombs named after a little boy and a heavy man, and the cold war between nations that followed. The planes were made for spy missions, surveying enemy lands at unfathomable speeds.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe one day I can see the view from one of those,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe you will,&quot; he says, turning to face the last presentation wall we haven&apos;t seen yet. It reads FUTURE ENGINEERING TALENT, with a few profiles of new engineers. </p><p>&emsp;He scans through the posted pages like trainees at the Academy after an exam. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;What is this?&quot; He asks, trying to mask his words as only those of curious interest, but then mutters, &quot;a fucking email sent to them?&quot; His fingers trace the dates of hire. &quot;Some have been here longer than I have!&quot; And when his hand reaches the profile on the guy in the elevator, his hand balls into a fist.</p><p>&emsp;I approach him. &quot;What&apos;s wrong?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He pulls out his smart telephone, scrolling frantically through it, opening an app with messages that read longer than a simple text. He scrolls the subjects of those correspondences, getting angrier and more dejected as he looks further and further. &quot;So they just don&apos;t consider me, huh? Because my dad doesn&apos;t have a fucking name around here, and I came from nothing, so they&mdash;&quot; He curbs his words when he realizes I&apos;m still here. &quot;Heh. Sorry, Katiya. Just some work stuff,&quot; he says, smiling with an embarrassed laugh.</p><p>&emsp;He hears voices behind us coming around the hall, and he drags me beneath one of the displays. I open my mouth to protest, but he covers it, and I recognize the voices in an instant.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Finally somewhere quiet, huh?&quot; Reed asks. &quot;I might be good at the social stuff, but even I&apos;m pretty tapped out.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And I never get out,&quot; Kei says. She walks towards the display we&apos;re hiding behind. I watch Cody&apos;s mind scroll through possible explanations to diffuse the embarrassment, but just as she&apos;s about to cross our hiding spot&mdash;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Here it is,&quot; Reed says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot; We watch Kei&apos;s heels pivot as she turns.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You never got the email about this?&quot; He asks. &quot;You&apos;re still new enough, right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The new talent wall? I think I forgot to respond to the email about it.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It was something the Engineering Director was pushing through. Said he wanted to highlight some of the fresh talent.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;We hear silence as they scan the wall for something. &quot;There&apos;s mine,&quot; Reed says. But Kei looks further.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I really hope he hasn&apos;t come in here,&quot; Kei says. &quot;Haven&apos;t seen Cody or that neighbor he brought, so I hope they went home.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Another silence.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. He&apos;s not even on the wall,&quot; Reed says. &quot;Did he not fill it out?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He totally would have filled it out. You see the way he looks up at this place? His eyes get more sun dreaming of this place than any of the lifers that sit next to the windows.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe it was an accident. Some kind of mix-up?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know about that,&quot; Reed says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How can you be so sure?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just something I&apos;ve thought about since I came here. Some talk between my dad and his best friend, the Director of Engineering.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, he got you hired here,&quot; Kei says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But there was more,&quot; Reed says. &quot;I was listening to them on the patio out back behind our place. He said he&apos;s clearing the way for me. And that &apos;that other engineer wouldn&apos;t be an obstacle.&apos;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The &apos;other engineer?&apos; You don&apos;t mean...&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He said Cody was unexceptional. Just did his time and left, not really ever trying once he reached a certain point. That the life left him. That he never makes an effort to meet anyone, and that he&apos;d be easy to make an excuse for,&quot; Reed says, and I watch Cody bow his head as he balls his fists. &quot;I mean, I like the guy a lot. We&apos;re pretty similar, and I really want to be buddies with him.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Kei takes a long pause. And I almost think she&apos;ll stand up for him. I hope she does, for Cody&apos;s sake, but she says something else. &quot;We used to be pretty close, you know. High school, we dated: just like his mom said, and he was so full of this joy, it was like staring at the sun.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Reed asks, &quot;But what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But the summer I left for school was when he lost his brother.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;He lost his brother?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. To some conflict in the war: Jackson was a Navy SEAL. And Cody never opened up about it. And by the time his last year of high school ended, he followed me to college, but I couldn&apos;t even recognize him. He was just a shell. And he still is, though sometimes there&apos;s a glimmer of that guy who had so much joy. That I liked a lot,&quot; Kei says, looking around nervously. &quot;I hope something changes. Because he&apos;s surely next out of all of us.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;They turn to leave. And Reed says, &quot;Well, at least I can be that for you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Kei laughs. &quot;I still don&apos;t know if I&apos;m ready for that,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;I feel angry for him. I want to stand up and call them out for speaking so ill of him. In fact, I begin to stand, but Cody weakly grabs my borrowed shirt.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Stand down, soldier,&quot; Cody says. &quot;It&apos;s alright. Nothing they said was wrong.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But this Reed guy is slighting you! His family line is aimed to cut you down because you&apos;re in his way, though you&apos;re the venerable one,&quot; I say, grabbing his shirt while I turn his chin to look in my eyes, finding the crest of his tears ready to break.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Maybe I deserve it,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve become a mess since then. I dragged myself through this stupid degree because it&apos;s what I used to want to do. I&apos;m running on fumes of a past when I was fueled on that thing: the spark, what Kei and anyone else liked about me.&quot; He sniffles, trying to keep his tears to a professional medium. &quot;No passion. No prospect of a girlfriend in years. I don&apos;t know . . . I think I just suck now. Even my parents can sniff it out.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;His words anger me because they insult someone I&apos;ve come to care about, and it&apos;s him, and of all my years of guarding, I feel nothing more than the urge to protect this guy and his precious dream.</p><p>&emsp;I feel the heat rise in my circuits as I grab the collar of his shirt, forcing him to look at me as I pin him against the display. I dissolve his tears with the Essence in my hands. &quot;You listen. Your dreams are far from stupid, Cody Dunsmore, and you are gods-damn precious,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;He looks down. &quot;You&apos;re just&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Shut up,&quot; I command, jostling him against the wall to shock him into a sense of truth. &quot;Can&apos;t you see that you&apos;re already enough as you are? You say the ale doesn&apos;t taste any different. And you&apos;re the only person I&apos;ve ever found who means it. You care,&quot; I say, &quot;so Gods-damn much about anyone.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s just lonely,&quot; he says. He gestures for me to get off him, and I help him to his feet. &quot;I think something broke in me that I can&apos;t fix.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I said I&apos;d tell you why I invited you here. I mean, yeah &mdash; all the engineers and techs and business guys were ogling you, and you&apos;re an amazing piece of arm candy. You even made my family have faith in me again.&quot; He laughs. &quot;But I brought you here because I have no one else to share this with. It feels like everyone&apos;s left me or moved on. And I&apos;m tired now. And it&apos;s getting so late.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I wrap my arms around him, letting the heat of my body speak where my words fall short. He hesitates, but then gently returns my embrace, holding for just a second before he releases. And even in his act of forced vulnerability, I almost feel a piece of myself open, too.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Bastards,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh?&quot; I ask.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Bastards have probably already eaten their way through the food trucks,&quot; he says. &quot;I totally forgot. Usually it&apos;s like eight bucks for a slice of pizza, but Navidson-Monroe&apos;s footing the bill.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I don&apos;t know what a food truck is. But if it&apos;s designed to move, and it has food in it, I assume it won&apos;t be around for long.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;And hey,&quot; Cody says. &quot;You have to be careful saying stuff like that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask, noticing his face flushes lightly now that we&apos;re out of the dark.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You have a boyfriend. And yet you almost made me break our tenth rule.&quot;</p><p>&emsp; &quot;Then you must be weak,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Too weak for me,&quot; I say, though I feel refreshed by his sincerity. &quot;But that doesn&apos;t mean I can&apos;t help you.&quot;</p>"},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"70","GivenName":"Domestic Relations","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Nine","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Twenty-Three","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":9,"ChapterFull":23,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":87,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"First Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"84","Synopsis":"Katiya and Cody go on separate dates.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.23","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"06/24/26","FantasyTime":"2A-128, 23rd of Suntide","StoryDay":"Wednesday","Setting":"Hearthland Ridge Estates"},"DocName":"21 // &quot;Domestic Relations&quot;","Body":""},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":1,"AutoNameFull":62,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":9,"ChapterFull":23,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":1,"SceneFull":62,"AuthorNotes":"Still working on a bridge between scenes here.","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":88,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"First Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"85","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.23.62","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-60","Body":"<p>&emsp;She waits until I&apos;m fully seated in the car to tell me the news.

Her face flushes. &quot;I bought us the tickets, but that&apos;s only because I make big money compared to you!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;My mind is fast at this performance.

Another hundred dollars more than me?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Who said this was a date?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Please,&quot; I say. &quot;You said that, like, four sentences ago.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. I guess I did.&quot; She brushes several rebellious strands of her dense, dark hair behind her left ear. </p><p>&emsp;We fix our eyes on the distant mountainscape. It&apos;s the only fixed point when residential houses, rusted refuse, and reckless weeds tear past us at a blistering speed. The only place we&apos;re allowed to look when too much eye contact with anyone on this train might mean a fight, or an impromptu Sunday sermon.</p><p>&emsp;But despite the courage it took to come back here, it feels like no time has passed. It&apos;s not just because she&apos;s wearing the same white-and-blue summer dress she wore all those summers ago. Nor is it because she&apos;s wearing the same perfume. I assume those two things are just because she&apos;s living at home with her parents, not because she&apos;s trying to imply something.</p><p>&emsp;<span class=&apos;internal&apos;>Or is she? </span></p><p>&emsp;<span class=&apos;internal&apos;>No . . . I refuse to make that same mistake again.</span> But I can feel the excitement of that anticipation as I watch her there, trying not to notice the curvature of her breasts change with each jostle of the cabin, nor the slenderness of her smooth legs lightly damp with sweat from a blistering June day. Not letting that animalistic side that wishes to skip all this overtake what I&apos;m searching for &mdash; the one track of feeling that I&apos;m afraid I lost.</p><p>&emsp;I try to notice if I <em>notice</em> anything that might show I still feel that way about her. Or that I still have it in me to feel about anyone. I try to remember when I almost said that four-letter word to her, right on the same platform where we boarded this train, before fear and diminishing time sealed that path off from me for years. </p><p>&emsp;But that feeling isn&apos;t something you search for. It happens to you. It&apos;s a place you only realize once you&apos;re there, and I swear to God I have the emotional receipts to prove I was there.</p><p>&emsp;Our view of the Rocky Mountains is shaded by one of those big law firm ads that wraps around the train car, like looking through those bug-resistant screens that pixelate everything into a disparate spread of dots. Looking at the mountains makes me wonder how Katiya&apos;s date is going, hoping that she finds all the things she missed inside of Jullian. The silhouette of an image overshadows the entire car through the windows, but I can&apos;t see the full picture. I spend more time looking at how beautiful Kei is, accented with dots like the shading in a comic book, how little she&apos;s changed since the last time we were here, and wonder how much I&apos;ve changed in ways that I don&apos;t even realize.</p><p>&emsp;I do small talk. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;These windows are scratched to hell, huh?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What?&quot; She asks, distracted like she is when I approach her with redlines, still mesmerized by the way everything tears past us.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The windows. I thought I remembered the Denver Light Rail being a lot cleaner.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Was it ever clean?&quot; She turns to me with her sapphire eyes. &quot;Cleaning this system up is like sculpting dry sand.&quot; And I realize this small talk is getting me nowhere.</p><p>&emsp;I feel that mindless feeling rise within me, dragging me closer to her. She leaned that far earlier for a reason. She&apos;s wearing this dress and that perfume for a reason. Maybe she meant to fall like that. </p><p>&emsp;Or maybe she didn&apos;t. </p><p>&emsp;And yet all I want is to just make a move.</p><p>&emsp;I look weird now, the way I&apos;m bent over so far.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You drop something?&quot; Kei asks.</p><p>&emsp;My heart seizes, still absorbed in her words from a day before. &quot;No, I just . . .&quot; and then I feel my body move in an act of fear, finding myself right next to her on the two-seater with our legs pressed together.</p><p>&emsp;Her skin is so pleasantly cool. The smell of her is overwhelming, and I feel that same part that led me to all those meaningless hook-ups in college urge me to move a little closer.</p><p>&emsp;<span class=&apos;internal&apos;>But she&apos;s my colleague, </span>I think. <span class=&apos;internal&apos;>Didn&apos;t you learn last time that she doesn&apos;t see things that way?</span></p><p>&emsp;She&apos;s not moving away, keeping her position either because I made her vastly uncomfortable and she&apos;s stuck with me now, or because she&apos;s interested.</p><p>&emsp;But I don&apos;t want to assume. I don&apos;t want to lean on hope again.</p><p>&emsp;Her voice is warm. &quot;Took you long enough,&quot; she says, &quot;so is it realer now?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; I say. The feeling engulfs me after all these lonely years. I venture my hand on her leg, and she returns by placing her hand on top of mine, leaning close so I can feel even more of her. </p><p>&emsp;&quot;I guess we&apos;re right back where we started now, right? And yet you couldn&apos;t even ask on your own.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, what can I say? You&apos;re a lot of things I like. You still make me hella nervous.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Hella nervous?

Like in college, maybe.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But we were both out and around. It seemed like we were chasing a different experience. And neither of us was ready to come down to earth, you know?&quot; </p><p>&emsp;There&apos;s a part of me that yearns to break with all the darkness of those years. Meaningless hook-ups, lonely nights when my sorrow almost set me over the edge, and even though I long to relish the comfort of this exact moment, I&apos;m so afraid of showing it. I&apos;m afraid this feeling isn&apos;t what I want it to be, losing grasp of my ability to judge, falling headlong into that hedonistic sense of longing.</p><p>&emsp;And so I press my lips against hers to try to remember again.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":3,"AutoNameFull":64,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":9,"ChapterFull":23,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":3,"SceneFull":64,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":90,"Label":"Narrative Revision","Status":"Revised Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"87","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.23.64","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-62","Body":"<p>&emsp;And so I press my lips against his to try to forget.</p><p>&emsp;The feeling has hunted me since we left Gaffesend in the carriage.

I said all the funny things at all the right times. I made sure to drink as much as I could when we went bowling, to loosen up a little, because even if alcohol makes me feel the call of the void the day after, I need to steal that emotional currency from my future self.</p><p>&emsp;Fact is that we walked into most of the stores, finding myself thinking what Katiya might choose. I chose an outfit for Kei, and she chose a funny work shirt for me.</p><p>&emsp;Fact is that we went bowling.

It&apos;s felt like there&apos;s something different now.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I take another sip of the rice wine. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I just . . . well, never mind. I don&apos;t want to get all serious.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No,&quot; I say, still flashing a smile. &quot;It&apos;s alright.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well,&quot; She hesitates, but after another sip, finds it in her to finish. &quot;You know, ever since what happened.

After the news report. The presentation. I shared his story. Hero for a day, or whatever.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Huh,&quot; she says. She looks out the high windows of the sunken, subterranean restaurant where many random shoes pass outside. I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ve convinced her. And I&apos;m not sure I have it in me to try. </p><p>&emsp;I fight that stupid feeling again that I buried for so damn long: either I had one too many, or scooped out a little too much of myself. But I don&apos;t trust her to catch me, afraid that if I fall, that I&apos;ll fall apart completely. </p><p>&emsp;So I pack it in, smile, and add, &quot;But that past is over.&quot; <span class=&apos;internal&apos;>Because it is.</span> &quot;And my brother Jackie would want me to live on.

I anticipate those basic-bitch California rolls to absorb all the alcohol in my empty stomach, and I find I&apos;m thinking of Katiya again, wondering what she&apos;s doing.

My body aches, but not yet from the freezing water. It&apos;s from the pain of how heavy-handed those backwater Ahkvasans are &mdash; digging their manicured claws into the thinnest muscles on our backs, extracting pain from our overworked muscles by dealing it. And now I&apos;m tasked to withstand the freezing water for a couple minutes, because it&apos;s supposedly good for me.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No Essence,&quot; Jullian says, seemingly humored by my suffering as he recovers in the warm tub. &quot;I didn&apos;t do it with Essence. No cheating!&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What, you think I&apos;m a cheater?&quot; I ask. The ache seeps into my bones, as if my marrow is infected with the Chymaeran Curse. </p><p>&emsp;My face twitches. </p><p>&emsp;I ask, &quot;and how long did you say this was for?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Five minutes,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;I tremble as gooseflesh spreads like a rash, feeling parts of my body contract that are beyond my control. &quot;Well, talk to me about something. I talked to you, didn&apos;t I?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Aren&apos;t we kind of out of things to talk about?&quot; He says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;How about the,&quot; my teeth chatter, &quot;how about how pointless this place is for people like us?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;He laughs. &quot;Just because you hate the cold tub&mdash;&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. Not the Gods-damn cold tub. I mean &mdash; can&apos;t anything be made a warm tub with our abilities? We could get in the bath at home and heat it in seconds.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But what about the nature?&quot; Jullian says, spreading his arms as he gestures to the open-air naked bath. &quot;What about the trip? Getting a little ways out of Gaffesend? The water has special properties. They say it heals you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;We can heal ourselves, too, you know.&quot; I tense my jaw shut to stop that Gods-awful sound of bone-on-bone.</p><p>&emsp;He smirks. &quot;Sounds like you don&apos;t like this date.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I do. All that doesn&apos;t mean this isn&apos;t nice. It&apos;s pain, just like every day. But it&apos;s good pain. Pain that&apos;s for you, you know?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;For you?&quot; He asks. &quot;Isn&apos;t all pain for the person in pain?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No, but pain that makes you better. Half the pain of our training is just lifting stuff all day, or walking laps around the border. But this is to make you feel better later.&quot; My arms tighten around each other as I shiver. &quot;Or it&apos;s supposed to. Right?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Sounds to me like your brain is starting to freeze,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe you should get out. And admit you&apos;re weaker than me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Or maybe you should admit you&apos;re bad at distracting me! Make me feel better,&quot; I say. &quot;Relax me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m not getting in there with you,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then talk about . . . the future,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;What about it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;About us. About what happens after all of this. After the trials, after probation and all.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;I expect his face to warm a little. Maybe from the thought of us living together and depending on each other like we planned, and I want to warm my spirit on that while my body freezes. But he hardly seems to give it a thought.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I don&apos;t know, haven&apos;t really thought about it,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m more focused on what&apos;s happening right now.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But really, though,&quot; I say. &quot;You haven&apos;t thought about any of it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I think I&apos;m already in the future I wanted,&quot; he says. &quot;And I hope tomorrow is just a continuation of that. Just the prospect of being free is enough: from all those awful years I never had the freedom to do anything. School, then training, then taking care of my brothers. Sleep for a while. Then repeat it all over again,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You met me in those years,&quot; I say, losing the feeling of ice.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. I mean, of course,&quot; he says. &quot;And you saved me from doing that forever. Could you imagine our lives if we weren&apos;t free like this? Boyhood was something I never had. And surely you&apos;d admit that you didn&apos;t have a childhood either.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I had a piece of one,&quot; I say. &quot;But what we have now is control. To steer our lives somewhere better. That after all the hard work and delayed gratification, we can reach something and call it ours. That thing we both wanted, remember?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I remember.&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Then I decide to test him. &quot;And what was it?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Settling down once we&apos;re on the other side. After our service.&quot; He sounds like a child reciting chores. Then he opens his mouth to modify that statement, but he pauses.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;But what?&quot; I ask. &quot;What&apos;s changed?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Nothing&apos;s changed. It&apos;s just&mdash;&quot; he starts, then lets out a long sigh. &quot;I remember being the oldest after both my brothers were born. And I remember school as the only time I had to enjoy myself. And my friends: Gavin and Auren, and how they&apos;d keep inviting me to things, again and again, turning them down every time since I had to walk home and pick up my stupid siblings and feed them. While they got girlfriends, and they forgot about me, and got new friends, and . . .&quot; </p><p>&emsp;Jullian clenches his fist and drives it into the water, but it doesn&apos;t launch a plume of hot water. His fist sizzles, sending clouds of water vapor to join the miasmic haze that hovers over the pools. </p><p>&emsp;He says, &quot;you remember the Harvest Festival before we left, I&apos;m sure.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Of course. The last real fun we had back there,&quot; I say. &quot;Just the two of us, walking between booths.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;That was the first festival I&apos;ve ever been to. And it just . . . gave me a taste of something. Like having sugar for the first time at age twenty.&quot; I feel like he wants me to extrapolate the meaning, but I don&apos;t get it. &quot;Like &mdash; is it so wrong?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Is what so wrong?&quot; I ask. &quot;You&apos;re not being specific, Jullian.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;So wrong to wish for something.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;To wish for what?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;To wish my father never died in the mining accident: to knock up my mother and leave me to care for them. Or to wish they were never born, and I could have enjoyed my life. Or if I can&apos;t go back there, then to change the present.&quot; But then he stops himself in his moment of passion. He recoils, frightened of his true nature for just a moment until his expression glazes over. &quot;Nevermind,&quot; he says.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. Finish the thought,&quot; I say, losing sense of the freezing water. &quot;What is it you wish for?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;For nothing,&quot; he insists. I can feel the anger and disappointment of all these months flood through me, but it can&apos;t come out of my mouth. I&apos;m choking on it, like holding back the urge to vomit: the thought of the something that comes after those final words. It&apos;s the thought of oblivion. That with how things are going at training, that I&apos;m headed for death anyways. That I don&apos;t have the time or the temerity or the looks or the emotional energy, and with all that fear, all I can do is keep holding it here.</p><p>&emsp;I bite my tongue until I think it bleeds, shutting my eyes as I fail to recognize what it does to me. He rattles off with some reason he found the time to make up, and as the panic makes me sweat like those sleepless nights in the dream of the cabin, I can feel the fingers closing in on me, surrounding my body with scentless smoke.</p><p>&emsp;But it isn&apos;t smoke. </p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s steam.</p><p>&emsp;And then I breathe it in.</p><p>&emsp;I think of things that rest me, but nothing works. The morning runs. The view from my house in the evenings. The love we had when I was building him up. And only when another man&apos;s face crosses my mind &mdash; that smug face of the outsider when he insults me, but in a friendly way; the expression he wears when he&apos;s deep in focus; the way his forearms fill the space in his shirt when he rolls his sleeves &mdash; the thought of Cody gives me a sense of control, of resistance. </p><p>&emsp;And so I open my eyes to find the water no longer at my shoulders. It boils beneath me as I sit here tucked in a ball, wondering how much longer I have to savor this mediocrity before I&apos;m sent off to die.</p><p>&emsp;I rise from the tub, covering my breasts with my arm as Jullian&apos;s eyes snare on something in the distance, too much of a coward to turn and face me, or even himself. </p><p>&emsp;But maybe that similarity makes us perfect for each other. </p><p>&emsp;I rush to the changing room as Jullian just sits there, without the strength to follow.</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":67,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":10,"ChapterFull":24,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":67,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":94,"Label":"Narrative Revision","Status":"Revised Draft","Keywords":"","UUID":"91","Synopsis":"","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.24.67","Perspective":"Cody","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-65-1","Body":"<p>&emsp;I have just enough strength to lead us: after all, I&apos;m the only one whose liver was trained for endurance in the fraternity house.</p><p>&emsp;It feels like I have a knot in my stomach, wondering if all those sushi rolls expanded from the liquor &mdash; like the time Jackson swallowed those &quot;Just Add Water&quot; dinosaur toy pills from the dollar store.

It was right after my parents bought me this used car for my birthday, because it had all the right &quot;safety features&quot; in some parenting magazine, and it was hot on the market.

Yes, Cody Dunsmore, I want to have sex with you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Well, yeah, that too, but . . .&quot; I scratch my head. <span class=&apos;internal&apos;>Shouldn&apos;t I be happy? </span> &quot;I just... I think I&apos;ve liked you for as long as I can remember. But, like, in a special way, you know,&quot; I say, approaching an unused word that scares me far too much. &quot;I know what you said in the train, but, what if there could be something more?&quot; I turn to face her as she still tensions her arms around me, missing the top half of her dress. She seems nervous, maybe even a little sad, like she&apos;s trapped in some way, so I add, &quot;I mean, we can&apos;t deny that we have feelings for each other. &quot; </p><p>&emsp;I don&apos;t know how it&apos;s possible to feel like I&apos;m being rejected when she&apos;s actively pressing herself against me. I anticipate her next words though she&apos;s trying to assemble them on the spot, like building a Lego set from only the picture on the box.</p><p>&emsp;As the calm-and-collected class president that once won the hearts of her classmates through words and promises, she still struggles to come up with a reply. And then after a while, she settles for one.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I think we should enjoy what we&apos;ve had,&quot; she says, and though I find I&apos;m apathetic to almost everything, I feel something beyond my lust that longs for something real. I mean, if I want a mental vacation to the past, I&apos;ll hang out with Miguel. </p><p>&emsp;But that &quot;something&quot; can only be something more if both people want it. So instead, I concede by answering her statement with a kiss. </p><p>&emsp;My heart sinks a little, but I still allow myself to ride the rapture of that feeling that&apos;s so fleeting when it comes and goes. I watch from somewhere distant inside myself, taking a backseat to the mindless entrancement of that primal desire, as I peel off the rest of her dress.</p><p>&emsp;I kiss deeply all the warmest parts of her; fully aware that we&apos;re going to burn out bright again; succumbing to a rhyme of that familiar learned helplessness. I go through the motions &mdash; no longer wondering if I&apos;m in love or incapable of it &mdash; as I have her on the couch, feeling her surrender to my strength as I try to ignore the sound of arguing next door.</p><p>&emsp;After the blissful exchange, we shower (separately) and snooze in my bed. I find it&apos;s lighter sleep than the time I accidentally fell asleep with Katiya death-gripping my shoulder, softly pleading me not to go, remembering the feeling of that odd, satiating feeling I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever felt before.</p>I drive her back to her car, and we hug, but don&apos;t kiss. I spend the rest of the day tinkering in the garage, trying not to sneeze from all the dust in my senior project&apos;s plastic casket.All I know is that my presentation for work is next week, and I&apos;ve made it <em>exactly</em> the way they taught me &mdash; as uninspired, soulless, and simple as possible."},{"DocType":"Chapter","PercentComplete":"","GivenName":"Losing To Fear","NextPublish":"7","PublishOn":"","AutoNamePart":"Chapter&nbsp;Eleven","AutoNameFull":"Chapter&nbsp;Twenty-Five","ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":11,"ChapterFull":25,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":"","SceneFull":"","AuthorNotes":"","Index":99,"Label":"Paragate","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"","UUID":"96","Synopsis":"Katiya&apos;s performance takes a dive.","Summary":"","VerboseID":"3.25","Perspective":"Katiya","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"07/06/26","FantasyTime":"2A-128, 35th of Suntide","StoryDay":"Monday","Setting":""},"DocName":"23 // &quot;Losing To Fear&quot;","Body":""},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":1,"AutoNameFull":72,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":11,"ChapterFull":25,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":1,"SceneFull":72,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":100,"Label":"Generative Revision","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"97","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Competency test for Katiya: first time she&apos;s been back to the base at a regular time. Undergoes the examination, tested in combat.","VerboseID":"3.25.72","Perspective":"Default","SettingInfo":{"ModernTime":"","FantasyTime":"","StoryDay":"Undefined"},"DocName":"PG-67","Body":"<p>&emsp;Inspired. Soulful. And as unpredictable as possible. </p><p>&emsp;It was the way my instructors in the Northaven military academy told me to approach my combat: that there were only so many techniques they could teach us to commit to memory, that the artistry of the process would have to supersede the mechanics.</p><p>&emsp;But I was far from inspired or soulful when I woke up three hours ago: the first time in a while that the rapping of the knocker beat me to breakfast, causing me to rush through the motions of getting ready. I wore the odd undershirt that Cody gave me to find the slightest advantage when inspiration and soul feel unreachable &mdash; especially after the night before, when I sent Jullian home without any parting grant of affection.</p><p>&emsp;Now I stand in a shooting stall for a short interlude. Test three of four: a brief intermission between demonstrating acts of war. Strength and conditioning were easy because I can train both of them outside the base, avoiding the garrulous crowds that love to speak ill of the weak. And though I placed in the top percentage for each of them, it&apos;s the remaining tests that concern me the most. Especially the last one: because defending the innocent is the entire point of service as a Royal Guard.</p><p>&emsp;My finger hovers off the conductive plate of the aged IGR-4 Cinderjack rifle, a beast that&apos;s never seen war since it&apos;s spent most of its life collecting dust in the armory. I tuck my elbow to my chest, trying desperately to steady my trembling hand on the grip. My overwhelming concern for failure spills over the threshold of my mind, leaking its way into all my nerves and muscles. And the more the anger resists the trembling in my hands, tensing the tendons into a static position, the less control I find I have.</p><p>&emsp;My right hand impatiently waits on my left arm to steady the barrel of the Cinderjack. My eye stares directly downrange through the crosshairs at a disparate spread of punctured points in the paper, depicting the silhouette of a Chymaeran with its sickly, amethyst claws drawn. But not a single shot has hit the two-dimensional bastard in the head, between its triangle of eyes. Only two of the five shots I&apos;ve taken have ripped the black ink on the parchment.</p><p>&emsp;The Essenced energy coalesces in my right index finger. I can feel the conductivity of the cold steel plate connected to the ignition chamber as my finger is drawn towards the metal, and when I lightly contact the combustion plate, transferring the Essence to incinerate the blasting powder, the round blasts through the rifle, startling me again, punching a sixth hole in the upper left corner of the page.</p><p>&emsp;I look around, expecting laughter, but the shooting range&apos;s bays are partitioned by thick steel blinders. Behind me is only the bag of gear I brought for all the exams. And when I look out across the span of twenty sheets, I&apos;m the worst of all of them. </p><p>&emsp;The guard next to me holds a tight spread of eleven shots that are damn-near heart center, surely the best out of everyone &mdash; and yet my hands tremble so much that I have to rest the rifle against the stand. I watch my rival&apos;s rifle protrude from the edge of the partition one last time to purge the mag of its twelfth and final round. </p><p>&emsp;His barrel is steady. His aim is calculated. And when their finger conducts Essence through the Cinderjack, the rifle hardly jumps as a bullet hole erupts through the black on the page: completing a circle of holes so perfectly apportioned that it clips a single paper snowflake, excising the entire Chymaeran&apos;s chest.</p><p>&emsp;And then a set of long, black, manicured nails reaches for the rope of the pulley, dragging their disfigured parchment victim back to the firing line. And when it arrives, I raise my rifle in response, insecure about all the time I&apos;m wasting. I fight the tremor I&apos;ve had since the night of the fire, but just before I can begin to take aim, I feel a hand on my shoulder.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Stop for a moment. You have to stop holding on so tightly.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s a female voice. And I realize that my rival isn&apos;t a man after all.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;You&apos;re making the same mistake that my older sister did: trying to overcompensate for the recoil. But you&apos;ll never be able to control it. Just let it happen,&quot; she says.</p><p>&emsp;I feel my ego flare on her words, as if someone my age should be sharing an instructor&apos;s commands. But I&apos;m not good enough to do anything other than agree. &quot;Thanks,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Just &mdash; stop for a minute,&quot; she commands. &quot;Those rounds aren&apos;t going to leave the mag on their own: they can wait for a little while.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;Uncomfortably, I lower the rifle and return it to the rack, and when I turn around, I find she&apos;s the only other Ahkvasan in our class: a cross-blooded demihuman with jet-black hair and cat ears that stares me down with slits of piercing, blue eyes, a visual rhyme that I can&apos;t yet place. She&apos;s trying to be helpful, but her words sound like ice, lacking any of the warmth that might comfort me. Yet her eyes light with some odd glimmer of excitement.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Katiya Breakey-Hilde,&quot; she says. &quot;You&apos;re one of the survivors of Hillfar that returned to finish the fight. I&apos;ve heard so much about you.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh, really?&quot; I ask, wondering if now is really the time when I&apos;m in the middle of failing my third exam. &quot;And who told you about that?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;I was in the same Strategies class. For the final project, you gave that &apos;after-action&apos; analysis on what should have happened during the Siege of Hillfar &mdash; and told the story of your survival. You said you were coming back to &apos;save whoever your could from the same fate you were too small and weak to resist.&apos; And your courage is actually what gave me the idea to follow my sister here.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Your sister?&quot; I say. &quot;And I followed my brother. Maybe they know each other?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;She&apos;s no longer around,&quot; she says, bluntly.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Oh. I&apos;m sorry to hear that.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;No. She was too weak. She was sent to the front lines. She didn&apos;t make it to the other side,&quot; she says, showing the slightest sliver of emotion that immediately dissolves.</p><p>&emsp;I feel the urge to return to my exam, but she keeps talking, extending her hand. &quot;My name is Aryn. Aryn Kesgrisin. I tried to introduce myself when I was standing right next to you at the parade, but we were interrupted.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah. By a humiliating failure,&quot; I say, turning my eyes down to the floor.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;It was an act of courage that others are jealous of. Malicious talk is all they have. Ever since that day I admired you even more,&quot; she says. &quot;Jullian says I speak so highly of you that <em>I</em> should be in a relationship with you instead of him, though I don&apos;t know what that means.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Jullian?&quot; I ask. My stomach turns in another direction. &quot;How do you know my boyfriend?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Jullian is one of the friends in our group. He talks a lot about you: complains that you never go on quests with us. I think those local quests are such a waste of talent, don&apos;t you think? Just an excuse to dole out skilled soldiers for stupid chores.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;A waste?&quot; I ask. &quot;I think they&apos;re important. You have to do your time to get to know the people.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;See? That&apos;s what I tell Jullian,&quot; she says. &quot;He keeps telling us you&apos;re afraid. But a person like you, that came back here to protect? I didn&apos;t believe that for a second.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I say, hoping I can bend the anger of that truth into six more perfect rounds in a Chymaeran&apos;s chest. &quot;I came here to serve first. I&apos;ll be living with these people, so I should know them.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then I ought to join you one of these times,&quot; Aryn says, rolling the target sheet in her claws until it becomes a punctured scroll. &quot;Well, I hope our paths cross again soon. And if it&apos;s today, I won&apos;t be showing you any mercy. You&apos;re a good rival, and there&apos;s a lot I think you can teach me.&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Until then,&quot; I say, feeling far more unraveled than I did before. The proctors begin to clean the nineteen other bays for another round of cadets, and when I get a glare from one of Aldrin&apos;s instructors, I level the rifle towards the sinister glare of the unwounded Chymaeran silhouette.</p><p>&emsp;I repeat her words, distracting myself with how senseless and insincere they sound. Just let it happen. </p><p>&emsp;I rack the seventh round. Just let it happen, Katiya, though every blast reminds me of the raucous explosions I heard in the distance as a child in hillfar, just waiting for one of those blasts to come closer.</p><p>&emsp;Upper right corner.</p><p>&emsp;Fuck.</p><p>&emsp;Just let it happen. Maybe you should have let yourself die. Maybe you&apos;re just dragging out something that should have happened all those years ago. I ignite the Cinderjack again, blasting a hole through the top of the Chymaeran&apos;s head.</p><p>&emsp;Just let it happen, you yellow bitch. How about you turn that gun around?</p><p>&emsp;Bottom left thigh, barely in the black.</p><p>&emsp;You were such a hero, the way you let that Chymaeran guised as Bertram just &apos;let it happen&apos; to that noble.</p><p>&emsp;Midsection. Crotch shot, barely off the black.</p><p>&emsp;And the way you let it happen with Jullian walking all over you. Maybe I&apos;m the one that gave him that hickey on his neck.</p><p>&emsp;Bottom right of the page, entirely off the white.</p><p>&emsp;Let it happen? Maybe you&apos;ve never learned that if you just &quot;let things happen,&quot; that&apos;s how you get yourself killed!</p><p>&emsp;Dead-center headshot.</p><p>&emsp;And then I feel the tingling in my fingers, breathing heavily, realizing that I haven&apos;t been breathing this entire time.</p><p>&emsp;It&apos;s only after I retrieve the target that I turn around to find my friends gathered behind me: Paxton, Naya, and Ryder, with Bertram skipping this round of exams to finish his recovery.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;The final test is up next,&quot; they say. &quot;How did you fare on the others?&quot;</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Roughly average. Still can&apos;t shoot. I&apos;m done if I fail the next one,&quot; I say.</p><p>&emsp;&quot;Then we better group up,&quot; Paxton says. &quot;I hear we&apos;re facing Jullian and his friends.&quot;</p>"},{"DocType":"Scene","GivenName":"","PercentComplete":"","AutoNamePart":2,"AutoNameFull":73,"ActNum":3,"ChapterPart":11,"ChapterFull":25,"IsPrologue":"No","StoryName":"Paragate","ScenePart":2,"SceneFull":73,"AuthorNotes":"","DoSceneNum":"True","Index":101,"Label":"Planned content","Status":"No Status","Keywords":"Paragate, Katiya","UUID":"98","Synopsis":"","Summary":"Ends up placing below the cut line with other cadets, and is told so.
