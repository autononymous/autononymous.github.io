      "&emsp;In the long, dragging years after college, I thought that all I could ever want was to waste my life as efficiently as possible. ",
      "&emsp;But I feel something different now as I sit in the foyer of a home I can barely afford, watching the first snow of the year lightly fall beyond the glass of my front window, sitting in a folding chair as I consider everything that brought me to this exact moment.",
      "&emsp;While my mind deliberates over whether I was actually going to kill myself &mdash; or just being pathetically dramatic &mdash; I still shiver from either the chill of the outside air or fear of the inevitable. Maybe my body refuses to forget what I almost did to it, even if my mind has moved on. I sit there for what feels like hours, entranced by the stillness of the outside world as the crystalline flakes glow like fireflies beneath the street lights. My phone is still in my hand: the group text written but still unsent, and I try to draw the energy to care just a little bit more.",
      "&emsp;Some time after my meager patch of brown grass is covered in a layer of white, I hear a disturbance next door. Katiya&apos;s entry door screeches open at an improbable hour in the middle of the week, hanging open a little longer than it might take for a single person to get inside.",
      "&emsp;My eyes turn to the seven-segment neon numbers on the stove, reading a little after two o&apos;clock in the morning: it&apos;s far too late for Katiya when she hates drinking. ",
      "&emsp;With how early she gets up for patrol, she should be asleep by now.",
      "&emsp;So I grab my lacrosse stick again, scratched and battered to hell, and I stumble through the darkness towards the door as a strange wind flows out instead of in, and though I&apos;m weaker than a peasant in Katiya&apos;s world, I decide I&apos;ll try for a bluff if I have to.",
      "&emsp;I  slip through Katiya&apos;s door, rushing in with the sharp end of the stick leveled, ready to confront whatever faces me. But she doesn&apos;t have the energy to tackle me this time. ",
      "&emsp;And it&apos;s not because I&apos;m no longer a stranger. ",
      "&emsp;Katiya stands at the entrance of her home. Nothing shines on her because she&apos;s dressed like a civilian, her hair disheveled and unbraided, and her skin sullied with dirt and grime. It looks as if she hesitates to enter her own home. I think up a joke to lighten her spirits, but quickly find it isn&apos;t the time.",
      "&emsp;&quot;You never knocked,&quot; I say. &quot;For a whole week or so. I don&apos;t think I ever even heard you: quiet as a seminary mouse.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;And neither did you,&quot; she says, and sniffles, though I&apos;m unsure whether it&apos;s from the elements.",
      "&emsp;But it doesn&apos;t matter, because it&apos;s my chance to be warm for her, whether or not it&apos;s because I need it, too.",
      "&emsp;I rest my lacrosse stick against the wall with her greatsword, and swiftly approach her. She trembles, still hesitating to enter like a vampire without verbal permission, so I wrap my arms around her, goading her to join me on the IKEA couch we spent a weekend afternoon jamming into her world.",
      "&emsp;She doesn&apos;t say anything, so I listen to her silence. I can feel the rise and fall of her chest as she tightens herself against me, wondering what catastrophe could ever bring the strong, resilient knight to her edge like this. ",
      "&emsp;I look down at her head that&apos;s coated in leaves and branches, and as I rub her back, I feel that sensation of warmth slowly return to me, though it&apos;s not the power of her Essence, and as the minutes pass, waiting for her to turn her eyes to mine and explain the past week, I find my fingers working through her hair.",
      "&emsp;She snorts, halfway between a laugh and a sob. &quot;What are you doing, Cody?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I thought you were training to be a knight, not a dryad,&quot; I say, gingerly tugging at a small branch snared between several strands of her golden hair.",
      "&emsp;She looks up at me with her amber eyes, reddened with tears, and I feel the cool air convect the places her sorrow saturated my shirt. I shiver, and realize I&apos;ve been shivering this whole time, still paying for the consequences of my seditious sit-in against the will to live.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Your hands are so cold,&quot; Katiya says. She leans back against the couch with a sniffle, taking my hand between hers, and is startled at how deathly pale my extremities are. &quot;Khiras above, Cody, what happened?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I lost,&quot; I say. &quot;And I almost lost it all.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Lost what?&quot; she asks, and I feel her radiant warmth spread across my pallid flesh with pins-and-needles.",
      "&emsp;&quot;Lost my job. The respect of my father. And the will to live,&quot; I say, beginning to sob like Katiya as I struggle to mutter the last syllable. &quot;I think I tried to kill myself.&quot;",
      "&emsp;She pauses, then pulls me closer. I expect her to ask where, and how, and why, but she just stays there, sitting in the same space of emotion that I do, refusing to leave when it&apos;s just the two of us leaning together, trading just enough heat to ward off the chill.",
      "&emsp;&quot;I think I did, too,&quot; she says. ",
      "&emsp;&quot;What happened?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m being released from the program.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;From being a Knight? But why?&quot; I ask. &quot;You do scouting every day now.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;It wasn&apos;t because of a mission I was assigned,&quot; she says. &quot;It was because of a mission I chose.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;What mission?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I tried to save someone dear to me.&quot; She forms her mouth in the shape of a name, but hesitates to speak it, as if she doesn&apos;t deserve it. &quot;I just got back from the funeral in my hometown. He was buried in the same place I killed him, and I just walked, and walked, until I begged the ground to swallow me the same way it made him disappear.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; I say.",
      "&emsp;She pauses as if to let me explain myself, but my suffering has nothing to do with death. It&apos;s just a pathetic genetic weakness.",
      "&emsp;She then asks, &quot;and what happened to you?&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;It&apos;s pathetic,&quot; I preface. &quot;I tried to throw myself from an edge. I&apos;m just tired of being so tired all the time: wasting so much of my energy fighting for greatness, when none of my punches connect. I was only ever made to subsist, fighting something that will never let me enjoy anything. And it just makes me jealous sometimes, you know. Of the ones that never lost that spark.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;Spark?&quot; she says, and she rolls her eyes.",
      "&emsp;&quot;That spark of life, and it&apos;s amazing. You draw people to you because you feel through things so fully. I can tell you care so deeply. And it makes me feel so warm, when I&apos;m with you &hellip; even if we don&apos;t touch.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;It makes me weak,&quot; Katiya says. &quot;It makes me defective as a Knight, as a protector.&quot;",
      "&emsp;&quot;I think it&apos;s your greatest strength,&quot; I say, resting my trembling hand against her cheek. &quot;Your world is in chaos, and yet you have the courage to really care, even if it asks so much more of you.&quot; I think of the passion of that kiss at the Renaissance Faire &mdash; how attracted I was to her strength and joy &mdash; and I don&apos;t have to read our sheet of rules again to remember the boundaries we set between us.",
      "&emsp;&quot;But what do I do with that feeling, when all it ever does is drag me away from the fight? I tried to save &hellip; Bertram &hellip; and thought I was being brave, but I just ended up getting him killed,&quot; she says. &quot;But what am I doing wrong?&quot;"
