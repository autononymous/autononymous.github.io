1,1,1,Chapter Two,Robot Boy,A male office worker languishes in his listless life.,14,595,"In the long, dragging years after college, all I could ever ask is to waste my life as efficiently as possible. 
My mind loiters in the long lull between emails, dragging the 3D model on my computer in circles. The flat fluorescents take the office closer to a colorless center: what my colleague calls ""suicide gray,"" showing no sign of winter&apos;s transition to spring. Somewhere beyond the window shades and bleached brick walls, life awakens from its slumber in the foothills of the Rocky Moun..."
1,1,2,Chapter Two,Robot Boy,A male office worker languishes in his listless life.,14,1227,"I realize I&apos;m done working on the redline when my hands stop moving. Copying changes from a red-inked engineering drawing to the computer is easy enough to get lost in thought. The music from my brother&apos;s old IPod keeps the rhythm in the keys. I pop out one of the yellowed earbuds so the lyrics don&apos;t mince the words.
In the title block: DUNSMORE, 04/24/26.
Checked by SAKURASHIMA, 04/24/26. That means I have an excuse to let my crush Kei look at it.
Designed by PRADESH, the guy wh..."
1,1,3,Chapter Two,Robot Boy,A male office worker languishes in his listless life.,14,1839,"I retreat to my desk to doom-scroll through social media, trading the personal feeling of apathy for a more global feeling of hopelessness. It fills me with a certain kind of despair when I see all the marriage announcements of friends and acquaintances, like I&apos;ve continuously been behind since I never dated in college: not even Kei. I had some fun, but I was too busy for anything meaningful. And as the only child left in my family, my parents beg for grandchildren like I used to beg for s..."
1,2,1,Chapter Three,Tiger Girl,A female knight trembles at the edge of eternal war.,21,256,"He said that I would never find peace in shouldering the weight of all the world. He said it wasn&apos;t because I was weak, or that I was naive &mdash; or that I wasn&apos;t aware of all the reasons we had to be afraid.
He said it was because those feelings were wasting my life. And then he died the next day in his sleep: burned alive with his youngest progeny that lacked the strength to fight back.
My father made the same mistake that all the other villagers make, thinking that suffering is o..."
1,2,2,Chapter Three,Tiger Girl,A female knight trembles at the edge of eternal war.,21,941,"I hoped this week would never come. 
Six months have passed since we arrived here. We were taken straight from graduation, the first time they hitched wagons to motorcars instead of horses.
It was as soon as we dropped our bags in the barracks that the Royal Guardsmen kept us busy in every waking moment, spending every second of daylight training in the militarized city of Gaffesend. And every night, I found myself at the taverns (though I never touched so much as a drop of ale), dragging my bo..."
1,2,3,Chapter Three,Tiger Girl,A female knight trembles at the edge of eternal war.,21,1149,"It all starts when Chief Aldrin climbs the small stage. Tonight it&apos;s edicts instead of music, and he takes a swig from his mug to make sure the words sound like a toast instead of orders.
""It was three months ago that you all graduated in the top of your class. Instead of heading straight to the front lines, you were chosen to challenge yourself with a higher purpose. You demonstrated that you might have what it takes to join our ranks full-time. And starting tomorrow, you&apos;ll get your..."
1,2,4,Chapter Three,Tiger Girl,A female knight trembles at the edge of eternal war.,21,1184,"The fledgling Royal Knights form a line at the kegs, their mugs wavering as suds spill across the warped wooden floorboards. We raise our full cups as color drains from the sky, and somewhere across Lake Garrison, the faint amethyst glow of Chymaeran Essence emanates from the silhouetting pines.
I throw back another two fills on a challenge, and not long after, I find myself among the last of our group. Most of the others left to explore their new townhomes as official trainees of the Royal Gua..."
1,3,1,Chapter Four,Firsthand Home,Cody returns to his new place in his hometown.,28,966,"""I can unpack it all tomorrow. Let&apos;s just toss it all inside.""
""But you have to unpack,"" my mom says. ""All the stuff from your bedroom is still in our living room!""
It surprises me how incapable I am of doing two things at once. As I approach my car, my free hand fumbles in my pocket, searching for my keys, and I grab them by the piece of painters&apos; tape that&apos;s still stuck to the new house key.The blue strip is scribed in Sharpie with the name DUNSMORE, and as I flip it around wit..."
1,3,2,Chapter Four,Firsthand Home,Cody returns to his new place in his hometown.,28,937,"I press the button on the steering wheel, and CALL ACTIVE flashes in segmented letters on the LCD. Hearing his voice over the phone makes it feel like he&apos;s speeding around the curves in the car in front of me, calling to ask if we can stop off at Sonic for a milkshake before we unpack the tents from our cars.
 But many years have passed since those summers.
""Hey, buddy."" His voice is raspy over the phone. ""How have you been?"" 
""Pretty good, Scott,"" I say, making sure to pitch my voice up.

1,3,3,Chapter Four,Firsthand Home,Cody returns to his new place in his hometown.,28,1406,"A Bankers Box is the last thing I have to store away in the small closet beneath the stairs. It&apos;s somehow lived to service my family through many moves, and the yellowed white of the cardboard is long-aged to prove it.  First is the word OFFICE in my mother&apos;s cursive from twenty-some years ago. That was scratched out to say COLLEGE STUFF in my father&apos;s handwriting five years ago. Four years later, for the long move back, I amended that with a semicolon, adding ENGINEERING TEXTBOO..."
1,4,1,Chapter Five,Secondhand Cottage,Katiya rushes to begin her first day.,35,394,"The next lucid moment, I find myself pinned upside-down beneath a thick wooden rack. The heat climbs as I drag my heels across the floor, my clothes so black and charred that I pray my sweaty flesh might slick me back through the narrow space. Within the hot box of crackling logs and scalding cinders, the roar of recircling flames makes the house screech in agony when its bones crunch and crumble, casting twigs and thatch to the ashen floor.
The twisting and thrashing gets me nowhere, but when ..."
1,4,2,Chapter Five,Secondhand Cottage,Katiya rushes to begin her first day.,35,1438,"It takes a couple seconds before my mind is able to catch up on two decades of living history. It&apos;s not the first time my mind tormented me with visions of another life, one where the Gods of fortune hadn&apos;t intervened. My episodes were worse in the Barracks: so bad that they threw me in with all the other traumatized children of the war that tossed and turned too much in their sleep, waking the others with the foreshadowing shouts and screams of the slaughter that might await them.
I ..."
1,4,3,Chapter Five,Secondhand Cottage,Katiya rushes to begin her first day.,35,1198,"I descend the stairs in bare feet, carrying the thin cosmetic armor. The kitchen counters are vacant beyond some basic decorations: a bowl and a candle on every surface, what I&apos;ve learned is the bare minimum for any military-issued living space. Part of me hopes for an explanatory note from Jullian, but I find nothing, just my bag of possessions scattered across the floor.
My stomach rumbles when my nose notices the commerce street is open. I spark the burners with Essence, throwing on som..."
1,4,4,Chapter Five,Secondhand Cottage,Katiya rushes to begin her first day.,35,100,"The walk is quick since we already live in the military district, a few blocks from the boundary of the Gaffe Royal Base. We discuss the letters from our families, the identical layout of our houses, our headaches, and reminisce on the few moments of joy we experienced together in the capital.
With my best friend here, I can almost convince myself that it&apos;s all going to be alright, and I relish in the nostalgia of shared memories. The feeling carries all the way until we arrive at the post..."
1,5,1,Chapter Six,A Past Outgrown,Cody tries not to feel left behind.,42,1522,"""Since you started on your first day, you haven&apos;t been drug tested. What&apos;s gonna change their mind on Monday, bro? My work never runs drug tests,"" he says. Gunfire cracks over the TV, flashing the empty walls with pops of color.
""No shit, Miguel. Their corporate structure banks on baked box-boys like you. The ones that forget they&apos;re lifting crates and stocking shelves and selling printers for eight hours a day.""
""That&apos;s manager Miguel now &mdash; I order the little guys to ..."
1,5,2,Chapter Six,A Past Outgrown,Cody tries not to feel left behind.,42,1515,"""No, I get what you&apos;re saying, but what do you mean?"" Miguel says, slurring his words as he melts into the futon: the only piece of furniture our drunk asses could assemble. The overturned boxes are makeshift tables that keep the cans off the floor, since we&apos;re feeling too lazy to dig for a trash bag.
I lift the can to my lips, but I don&apos;t let the poison pass the threshold. Past experience tells me that I&apos;m toeing my limit: lost enough to let my stupid emotions leak on my fa..."
1,6,1,Chapter Seven,A Future Foretold,Katiya tries not to panic at what feels inevitable.,49,1027,"""Is that as bad as it gets? Or is this just because it&apos;s the first day?"" Pax asks. ""Maybe Aldrin wasn&apos;t lying. I thought we&apos;d be at the enemy&apos;s doorstep most days, waiting for one of them to break through."" He chows down on a raw potato that he withdraws from his pocket, spitting scraps with every syllable. ""But this is great &mdash; a little work for as much produce as you can eat!""
""As long as you don&apos;t get caught, you idiot,"" Ryder says.
The two hike behind us as the..."
1,6,2,Chapter Seven,A Future Foretold,Katiya tries not to panic at what feels inevitable.,49,1277,"I pass the threshold of the gate, gasping for breaths as my last sprint dissolves into a jog. It becomes immediately obvious that weren&apos;t the only ones to notice: most of the recruits gather outside the guard post, swarming around the re-purposed adventurers&apos; guild like flies to excrement. 
I spot my brother Erik leaning against the doorframe.
""What&apos;s happening?"" I ask.
""Some major Essence event.""
""Yeah, we saw it. We were on the southern hills."" 
I gasp for breath. He hands me h..."
1,6,3,Chapter Seven,A Future Foretold,Katiya tries not to panic at what feels inevitable.,49,1037,"""What was that about?"" Bertram asks. The grasp of his hands on my torso is so strong that I hardly have to walk.
""I ... I don&apos;t know,"" I tell him. ""I thought I got over this. I thought I wasn&apos;t so damn weak and pathetic...""
""You&apos;re not pathetic! You earned your presence here,"" he assures me. ""You had a bad day, is all.""
""But how can I last when it&apos;s really down to the wire, when it&apos;s real, if my mind fights me at something so simple, so stupid and pathetic and weak, lik..."
1,7,1,Chapter Eight,Strangers To Enemies,An otherwoldly threshold brings two strangers together.,56,1462,"It takes a moment to lift myself from the flimsy folding chair. I fight the spinning world, stumbling towards the kitchen counter to grab the remote. Freaky Friday autoplays on some free streaming service, since I was too lazy to enter the family account. I reach to turn off the floor-bound wall TV, but I hesitate &mdash; finding that I enjoy the faint sound of it over the silence.
It feels nice to have my friend here, I think.
The tears still wet my face, more from the laughter of digging up p..."
1,7,2,Chapter Eight,Strangers To Enemies,An otherwoldly threshold brings two strangers together.,56,1866,"If he wasn&apos;t handsome, I would have slit his throat. My mind can&apos;t catch up fast enough for all the semantics, but I know exactly what he means.
I can feel it.
My face flushes. ""You degenerate! You lecherous, filthy animal, breaking into my house to . . . to&mdash;""
""I swear, I didn&apos;t break in here,"" he insists. His face is redder than mine. He covers his crotch with his hands, as if hiding the pitched tent can make me forget. ""The door was open. I just walked in.""
""The door was ..."
1,8,1,Chapter Nine,Enemies To Combatants,Differences lead to misunderstandings and violence.,63,1155,"I wince at the pins and needles throbbing in my hand, thinking about how I&apos;m gonna borrow my cousin and her law degree and sue that damn bitch. Engineering might make me just enough to get by beyond the mortgage, but there&apos;s no way in hell I&apos;m paying for medical care. I&apos;ll take an Uber to the hospital before I call an ambulance.
Cursing under my breath makes it easier to bear. I tear the sleeve off my muddy, bloodstained shirt so I can try to wrap it up, all while I try to r..."
1,8,2,Chapter Nine,Enemies To Combatants,Differences lead to misunderstandings and violence.,63,1318,"I&apos;m mystified when I cross the threshold of the door. The room is dark, and though I can&apos;t make out the meager spread of items, I can sense how strange the shapes in this room are: so smooth and straight, as if they were cut by divine hands. When I find a glint in the artifacts on the shelves and walls&mdash;even the shelves themselves&mdash;I marvel at how much metal must have been wasted to produce all these things. He must be rich if he can waste money like this: maybe he&apos;s so..."
1,8,3,Chapter Nine,Enemies To Combatants,Differences lead to misunderstandings and violence.,63,151,"I throw open the window, dragging myself over the sill and depositing myself on the floor. My shoulder aches where her scalding hands burned me. I twist my body to get my feet beneath me, and manage to stand in front of the door.
I level the lacrosse stick after I lift it off the floor, tearing off the rubber end cap, flipping it around so the basket faces me. And surely enough, like a reflection in the mirror, I find the female knight standing there on the other side.
We pause there for a coup..."
1,8,4,Chapter Nine,Enemies To Combatants,Differences lead to misunderstandings and violence.,63,762,"I wager my strength and power over his defenses. The inebriated man called Cody holds the odd, metallic broomstick with his hands together in the center &mdash; a technique I&apos;ve never seen before &mdash; and calls out a phrase I can only decipher as a challenge.
If it&apos;s a sword fight he wants, I know I can make it to the greatsword leaning against the wall, because if this Auvryan cross-blood wants to wreak havoc on my home life with his illusions, sullying the most sacred place I hav..."
1,9,1,Chapter Ten,Strategic Retreat,Katiya struggles to shut out the intruder.,70,1355,"Whatever that thing is, it isn&apos;t a broom.
My mind races, but I still manage to remember the bloody dagger in the sink.
I roll behind the kitchen island as he brandishes the head of the stick against a wooden bowl on the counter, casting a whole slew of produce against the ground.
I lift myself by the counter&apos;s edge to dig my hand into the sink, feeling for the hilt of the dagger. 
""Your fight is with me, not the damn house!"" I say.
He bends down to scoop up one of the apples with the ..."
1,9,2,Chapter Ten,Strategic Retreat,Katiya struggles to shut out the intruder.,70,1293,"I dig my heels into the space between the floorboards, catching my breath as I drive my back against the closet door. My nails tension against the pad of my palm, leaving crescents in my flesh as the blood drains from my fingertips. 
My heart can only take so much in a day. I thought the enemy could only strike when my presence was voluntary; when I patrol the borders of Gaffesend by my own volition. And it only took a day for this peaceful haven to be violated by a stranger.
I can&apos;t keep ..."
1,9,3,Chapter Ten,Strategic Retreat,Katiya struggles to shut out the intruder.,70,1746,"I wake to a rapping on my door, but it&apos;s not the rhythm of the personal knocker. When I dip my head out the window, I find Bertram standing on the top step.
""You&apos;re up early,"" I say. I slept in my plainclothes, so I don&apos;t have to hide behind the curtain. "" I don&apos;t even think the knocker is awake yet.""
He tilts his head up at me. ""Sorry to wake you. I figure we might want to get started early if we&apos;re returning those quest forms.""
Sure. I&apos;ll be out in a minute,"" I t..."
1,10,1,Chapter Eleven,Surprise Approach,Changes at work put Cody on the edge.,77,1740,"Late Sunday morning, around 11:00, I awoke with my neck twisted against the closet door, my face saturated with drool, shirt missing, and a sticky note taped to my forehead with Miguel&apos;s handwriting that read ""DRINK WATER."" The pounding headache had mostly subsided: I must have slept it off, or drank loads of water the night before from how quickly I immediately had to sprint to the restroom. And after relieving myself, I found my phone on the counter with three unread texts:

1,10,2,Chapter Eleven,Surprise Approach,Changes at work put Cody on the edge.,77,1163,"""Nice to meet you all. I&apos;m Reed Broderick,"" he says. The executive hands him two dozen donuts, and he puts them on the table. ""I&apos;ve heard this is how you make an impression."" 
""You heard right,"" Kei says. The animals all reach their hands for the box, but I lean further against the wall. 
""So where are you from, Reed?"" Michael asks, his mouth full of donut. ""And how old are you? We&apos;ve got a lot of young ones on this team now.""

1,11,1,Chapter Twelve,Anxiety and Avoidance,Katiya tries to resist her paralyzing panic.,212,1147,"There&apos;s no early breaks in all the domestic quests. It only took a couple days before I realized that sitting on the job was a bad image, unless you have a lunch pail in your hands. Just like any routine &mdash; whether it&apos;s a new cycle of combat training, classes, or a new job &mdash; the first three days are memorable because it&apos;s all so fresh. I thought taking different quests would make each day distinct from the last, but from the fourth day onward, it all became a blur of m..."
1,11,2,Chapter Twelve,Anxiety and Avoidance,Katiya tries to resist her paralyzing panic.,212,1222,"They&apos;re close enough to run me over, but my body&apos;s trained to react before I can think. Muscle memory comes before thought, thought before fear, and fear before true reaction, so it&apos;s only when I&apos;m halfway across the road that the thoughts finally reach my muscles. The others are only beginning to notice when the Chymaeran fleshwalker raises the rifle. I&apos;m the only one that happened to know enough and be close enough to respond, and when I try to take another step, I fe..."
1,12,1,Chapter Thirteen,Ennui and Excoriation,Cody tries to evade his deepening depression.,219,1472,"I can only work as fast as the computer will take me. I&apos;ve spent so many hours between renders imagining how I would boost the performance if IT gave me a blank check and I was then the bottleneck &mdash; although a workstation laptop is nice to take home, it has nothing over one of those stationary rigs that the Robinson-Monroe lifers were grandfathered into.
They gave me the laptop two years ago, and it hasn&apos;t been updated since. One day I booted into BIOS to see if I could overcloc..."
1,12,2,Chapter Thirteen,Ennui and Excoriation,Cody tries to evade his deepening depression.,219,866,"""Hey bro. I was thinking we could talk about the project later,"" he says.
What is this, an undergrad lab? Is there a grade?
""Yeah, that&apos;d be cool,"" I say.
""What&apos;s your phone number? I already got Kei&apos;s last week. I was thinking we could make a group chat,"" he says.
""Uh, yeah, man, sure."" I take his phone. I enter CODY WORK in the top, and the ten digits in the box. He shoots me a text of the first three emojis in his ""recent"" bar, and then proceeds to make the group message right..."
1,12,3,Chapter Thirteen,Ennui and Excoriation,Cody tries to evade his deepening depression.,219,207,"I toss my keys on the counter: the house is a moderate mess when my parents aren&apos;t coming the day after. I slip my hand down my pants and grab the TV remote (not for porn), fixing the sweaty adhesion I&apos;d dealt with since the afternoon.
Reed messages about the happy hour in the involuntary group chat. He reminds me of my brother. And, surprisingly, Kei says she&apos;s going, too.
They ask me if I&apos;m coming, but the darkness of the foyer is too comfortable. All I want is to do nothi..."
1,13,1,Chapter Fourteen,Knocking At The Door,Chaos drives Katiya to the threshold.,226,772,"Calling his name will do nothing. I decide ahead of time to break in instead of patiently knocking, hoping the others piece together my purpose for panic instead of thinking I&apos;m just deserting. My two friends are built like bricks, but it&apos;s all the muscle that helps in a sprint. If Bertram&apos;s house were any further than three blocks, they might have fallen behind. My legs are long and my conditioning is great, but it&apos;s not enough. I feel one of them lift me into the air as I ..."
1,13,2,Chapter Fourteen,Knocking At The Door,Chaos drives Katiya to the threshold.,226,0,"When we arrive, the spaces between the buildings are strangely vacant. The escaped horses are hitched back to the familiar carriage, parked at the side of the headquarters: surely the royals are elsewhere, enjoying the finest accommodations.  I can hear a loud group of guards and civilians within the walls. I lament the straight walk through the center of the building we&apos;ll have to take to get Bertram the attention he needs.I can hear the voices of the commoners.""If your guards were smart ..."
2,14,1,Chapter Fifteen,The Sleeping Knight,Breakfast tacos relieve panic attacks.,233,1952,"Words are a currency she can&apos;t afford when her panic sets her over the edge. She speaks in strings of syllables I can&apos;t comprehend, but it&apos;s not her desperate cries that confuse me the most.
It&apos;s the fact that the last four weeks passed so peacefully. I thought this was all just a dream after that drunken night with Miguel, but the beautiful girl I mistook for a cosplayer chokes on her tears between breaths as she buries her face into my arm.
""They&apos;ve all abandoned me,""..."
2,14,2,Chapter Fifteen,The Sleeping Knight,Breakfast tacos relieve panic attacks.,233,1367,"I wake again from dreams of fire. My hand is always first to feel for the other side of the bed, but my fingers are already laced in something.
I long so deeply for something warm to hold. I want the heat to quell my panic, to overwrite the memories and feelings that sensation brings with something warm that&apos;s better. The cabin is collapsing again: no windows or doors, just a hot box of logs crumbling under the weight of my father&apos;s weakness, and I can feel my own muscles tension furt..."
2,15,1,Chapter Sixteen,Luddite By Chance,Cody gives Katiya a lazy day in Hearthland Ridge.,240,1238,"I never knew it was possible to misunderstand a taco. It seems pretty obvious that it&apos;s tall and narrow. That you have to rotate the thing sideways to put it in your mouth to take a bite, but Katiya wedged her teeth between the middle of the shell, taking bites like a chipmunk as she complained that the shell might spill it all.
Nor did I ever consider how the taste of processed food might be too much for someone that eats an antiquated diet of fruit and bread and meat, taken aback by how ..."
2,15,2,Chapter Sixteen,Luddite By Chance,Cody gives Katiya a lazy day in Hearthland Ridge.,240,1673,"He spends a near ten minutes trying to find twenty different ways to demand that I sit in the exact same place without touching anything. That I&apos;m safe. That I can&apos;t possibly get hurt, regardless of how fast we go. That anything foreign and strange and big and too impossibly smooth is there for a reason, and that nothing is going wrong unless he says it is, and that he&apos;ll surely bring it up if things are even slightly bad.

""Just humans,"" Cody says. ""So boring and dissimilar we call different skin colors different races, can you believe that?""

""No. Running is for people that hate themselves.""
""I guess it fits, then,"" she says: lacing up a set of minimalist running sandals that look like what the weirdos from Cross Country used to wear. ""You sprint for a while, then jog. And you do it again and again until you make it back.""
""Or you don&apos;t. And you&apos;re sure this is safe?""

Without the weight of my chest digging deeper trenches in the flesh of my shoulders, I feel so much lighter: my mind freed enough to take in the sights instead of staving off the thought of suffering.
It&apos;s morning just like it is in Cody&apos;s world, but the air feels fresher: not saturated with the smell of gas and engines like the capital. Sometimes I wonder if Cody&apos;s world traded the splendor of nature for every other sensation ..."

""The Royal Academy sent me here for a while,"" Cody lies, reciting the story we rehearsed on the tail end of the run. He crushes the ale almost as fast as Ryder and Pax do, because he was in some alcohol training program in college &mdash; at least from how he explained it to me.

The lifers leave early: forced to come in when it&apos;s still dark out so they can take care of their teenagers &mdash; or if they don&apos;t have kids, maybe drink at the bar or something. The young type-A engineers leave a little after so they can make the most of summer&apos;s long evenings, whether it&apos;s running or biking  out on the trails in the open fields between the housing developments, or..."
2,18,1,Chapter Nineteen,Bonus&mdash;Overnight,,261,1804,"I stumble through the dark since the window shades block twilight, leaving only three faint rectangles from the textured glass in the front door. The mounted television blinks blue, probably wise on me with all the automation tech &mdash; predicting that I&apos;ll waste another two hours scrolling through mediocre streaming selections before giving up to scroll on my phone.
I check my messages. Two from Reed, averaging five a week: half about design work and half setting up a half-baked punchli..."
2,18,2,Chapter Nineteen,Bonus&mdash;Overnight,,261,264,"I awake at 4:30 to find her breathing softly next to me: a line of drool sliding down my chin, and her hands tensioned on my arm as she buries her face into my shoulder, flinching sporadically.
The autoplay ran so long that it stopped on the third one before asking if we were STILL WATCHING. And when I reach to grab the remote, I find she grips me with such immovable force that I have no reach.
I fiddle with my foot until I feel the power button on my toe through the sock, and turn off the TV.

2,18,3,Chapter Nineteen,Bonus&mdash;Overnight,,261,648,"The charred cabin calls me back in my dreams. Maybe it knows I&apos;m going to visit today. And though I&apos;ve slept night after night feeling the warmth of my Essenced flesh scald with the memory of the fire, I find a chill course through my body. A lone figure that shoulders the weight of the beam with a wry smile, and though their silhouette is irreconcilable through the smoke, I feel safe for just long enough.
He&apos;s speaking my name, over and over, saying I have to work, but I&apos;m ..."
2,19,1,Chapter Twenty,Onward To Chaos,Bertram convinces Katiya to scout.,268,1546," I refuse to let in a chance for anything to happen, and that&apos;s why I rise early. Earlier than the knocker that comes to wake me. Earlier than the sun: early enough that the morning hours mask my presence while I wear the hood of my uniform, tucking my golden locks of braided hair beneath the fabric.
There&apos;s still the early risers that do their training in the mornings, and with the approach of our first competencies that all city guards are required to take, the training fields and t..."
2,19,2,Chapter Twenty,Onward To Chaos,Bertram convinces Katiya to scout.,268,1125,"""I want to apologize to you,"" Jullian says.
He takes my hand as we swelter inside the guard tent. I thought an open-air bazaar meant a cooling breeze might flow through every once in a while&mdash;or that the tattered tarp above our heads might block the rays&mdash;but the air scalds our lungs like sitting in a kiln.
He parts his chapped lips, and his eyes trace the floor in the same tick of nervousness he&apos;s had since I met him. But there are still signs we&apos;ve grown together. And when..."

The panic makes me hold fast to the metal contact: siphoning the friction of the Essence into my circuits in a rejuvenating reversal.
The energy cycles through my body from my arms to my legs, and though my blood freezes with the initial surge of panic, my circuits are scalding with power. The vibrations in the tether rattle the bones in my arms, casting sparks ..."
2,19,4,Chapter Twenty,Onward To Chaos,Bertram convinces Katiya to scout.,268,533,"""That wasn&apos;t our job! That was stupid and senseless,"" Jullian says. He looks at the bare flesh of my arm, scratched enough from rolling on roof stones that it bleeds in a staccato of open cuts. 
I can feel his power mend my flesh as we walk back across the abandoned fields, warming the skin and coaxing it to join again.
""I thought you&apos;d react differently,"" I say, cradling the artifact in my good arm.
""I think that was reckless, and you could have gotten yourself killed."" He looks at t..."

His eyes scan the thirsty townies standing behind the line of rope. ""Just because you don&apos;t get to drink first if you don&apos;t do the course does NOT mean you won&apos;t drink at all.""
""But all the fucking ale will be gone!"" One of the beer-gutted strongmen says. Even the hesitant men now join the line, shouting in agreement.

I have no idea what he means. ""But it&apos;s a shirt with a collar, right?"" I ask. ""I don&apos;t have the fancy noble clothes from your world. This was woven by hand!""

But when Cody&apos;s paramour presses the glowing arrow button, the doors slide open with a chime, exposing a tiny room that the three of us enter. The metal doors are just about to close when a fourth guy shows up, sticking his..."

And after watching as many of the children&apos;s science demonstrations as possible &mdash; while Cody eagerly riffed on about all these concepts named after scientists &mdash; we take a break on the east balcony that opposes the view from the elevator, looking out across his world&apos;s well-developed landscape.

""You did what?"" I ask. ""Really? But when?""
""It&apos;s when you were busy moping around behind the ration trucks,"" Katiya says, with a smug grin. ""But I didn&apos;t embarrass you too much.""

<span class=&apos;internal&apos;>So it is a date,</span> I think, rubbing the stubble on my chin that I shaved for the first time in months.

2,22,3,Chapter Twenty-Three,Domestic Relations,Katiya and Cody go on separate dates.,289,800,"And so I press my lips against his to try to forget.
The feeling has hunted me since we left Gaffesend in the carriage. It seems to trail every time that Jullian and I get together. It builds with the crescendo of all the unspoken questions: the useless questions that get us nowhere; the useless, pathetic questions that drive a larger wedge between us, preventing us from just enjoying things the way they are.
What more can I want?

And I realize our entire date has passed in a blur.
We sit downtown at some sushi restaurant on 16th Street Mall. I said all the funny things at all the right times. I made sure to drink as much as I could when we went bowling, to loosen up a little, because even if alcohol makes me feel the call of the void the day after, I need to steal that emotional currency from my future self.
Fact is that we walked into most of..."

My body aches, but not yet from the freezing water. It&apos;s from the pain of how heavy-handed those backwater Ahkvasans are &mdash; digging their manicured claws into the thinnest muscles on our backs, extracting pain from our overworked muscles by dealing it. And now I&apos;m tasked to withstand the freezing water for a couple minutes, because it&apos;s supposedly good for me.

It feels like I have a knot in my stomach, wondering if all those sushi rolls expanded from the liquor &mdash; like the time Jackson swallowed those ""Just Add Water"" dinosaur toy pills from the dollar store.

But I&apos;m already headed for the front of the complex, carrying my towel and overnight bag.
""Katiya, wait!"" He says.

Something that I haven&apos;t felt for a long time, and after all the events of the evening, I&apos;m losing control of that edge.
Surely it&apos;s the booze from the way the tears leak from my eyes a little, but the train car back is dark, and when I press my nose to the scratched window glass, feeling the vibrations of the rails, I feel that feeling steady itself just a little more.

""But I was able to get over my fears. You still cower in them every day,"" Jullian says. ""Not going on a single patrol quest? Have you even looked at the status board lately? Have you trained combat in any drop-ins? Have you even been inside the base?""

It was the way my instructors in the Northaven military academy told me to approach my combat: that there were only so many techniques they could teach us to commit to memory, that the artistry of the process would have to supersede the mechanics.
